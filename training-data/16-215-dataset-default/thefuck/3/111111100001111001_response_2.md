The issue in the `info` function is that it is trying to get the version of the fish shell using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. However, the expected version string includes the text "fish, version" which is missing in the current implementation.

To fix this, we need to change the command to get the complete version string including "fish, version".

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'fish --version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this change, the function should now return the expected value and type of variables for the provided test case.
