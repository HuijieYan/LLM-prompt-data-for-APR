1. The buggy function is named "info" and it is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell. The failing test function is testing the "info" function by mocking the Popen function.

2. The potential error in the problematic function is in the line `Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)`. This line is trying to execute the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` in the shell using the Popen function, but it is not capturing the version correctly.

3. The cause of the bug is that the Popen call in the "info" function is using the wrong arguments to get the Fish shell's version. The failing test is displaying the incorrect output from the "info" function, and the error message is indicating that the expected output is 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' but the actual output is 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'.

4. To fix the bug, the Popen call should be modified to correctly capture the version of the Fish shell.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

With this corrected code, the "info" function will properly capture the version of the Fish shell and return the string 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' as expected by the failing test.
