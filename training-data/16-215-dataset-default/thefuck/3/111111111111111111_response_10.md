The issue with the provided code seems to be with the command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. The expected version format 'fish, version 3.5.9' is not being retrieved correctly, which results in the failing test.

The cause of the bug is that the command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell is incorrect, which results in the version string being different from what is expected by the failing test.

To fix the bug, the command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell needs to be updated to match the expected format.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
from subprocess import CalledProcessError, CompletedProcess, run, PIPE, DEVNULL
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            result = run(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL, check=True, text=True)
            version = result.stdout.strip()
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        except (FileNotFoundError, CalledProcessError):
            return "Fish Shell version not found"
```

This correction should ensure that the version of the Fish shell is retrieved in the correct format, and the failing test should then pass. This also addresses the issue posted on GitHub regarding the recursive loop caused by the plugin.
