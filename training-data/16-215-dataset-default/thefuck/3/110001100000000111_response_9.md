The issue is related to the Fish.info() function in the shells/fish.py file within the thefuck repository. The problem seems to be that when Oh-My-Fish's TheFuck plugin uses the -v flag, it triggers a recursive loop due to the code in Fish.info().

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the use of the Popen function to execute the 'fish -c' command. 

The cause of the bug is that when the 'fish -c' command is executed, it triggers a recursive loop, leading to hanging of the Fish shell initialization.

To fix the bug, one approach could be to modify the way the 'fish -c' command is executed so that it does not trigger a recursive loop. 

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function, which should resolve the issue:

```python
import subprocess

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        version = subprocess.check_output(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL, shell=True)
        version = version.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError:
        return "Error retrieving Fish shell version"
```

With this corrected code, the issue of recursive loop triggering should be resolved. The subprocess.check_output method is used to execute the 'fish -c' command without triggering a recursive loop, and it should return the Fish shell version without any issues.
