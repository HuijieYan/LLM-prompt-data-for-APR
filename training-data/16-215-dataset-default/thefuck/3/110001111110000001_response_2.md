The potential error in the `info` function is with the command used to retrieve the fish shell version. The Popen command is using `echo $FISH_VERSION` to retrieve the version, but the failing test is expecting the version to be retrieved using `fish --version`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the Popen command to `fish --version`.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(', ')[1])
```

This code will pass the failing test, as it correctly retrieves the fish shell version using the `fish --version` command.
