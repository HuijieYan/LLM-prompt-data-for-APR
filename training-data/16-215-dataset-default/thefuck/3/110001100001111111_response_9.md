The problem with the current implementation of the info function is that it is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running the command 'fish -c "echo $FISH_VERSION"' and reading the output. However, this approach is not correct as it only returns the version number without the "fish, version" prefix that is expected.

The associated GitHub issue indicates that this buggy behavior is causing a recursive loop when the oh-my-fish plugin tries to use the "thefuck" plugin with the -v flag.

The fix for this bug would be to modify the command to include the "fish, version" prefix. This can be achieved by updating the Popen command to run 'fish -c "echo fish, version $FISH_VERSION"'.

The corrected code for the buggy function is as follows:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo fish, version $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().replace('fish, version ', '')
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected code should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided and also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
