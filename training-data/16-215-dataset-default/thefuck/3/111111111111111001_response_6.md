The issue with the `info` function is that it is using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` to get the version of the fish shell, but the failing test is expecting the command `fish --version` to be used. Additionally, the function is missing the necessary import statements, specifically `from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the command being used to retrieve the version and add the necessary import statements.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic


class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info` function will use the correct command to retrieve the fish shell version, and it will pass the failing test by returning the expected value.

Now, the function will satisfy the expected input/output variable information and pass the failing test.
