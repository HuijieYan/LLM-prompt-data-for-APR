1. The buggy function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell. It uses the Popen function from the subprocess module to execute a shell command and capture the output. However, there are potential issues with how the Popen function is being used.

2. The potential error location is the usage of Popen to execute the 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION' command.

3. The bug is caused by not waiting for the process to finish before reading the output of the command. The Popen function launches a process, but the output is read before the process has finished, leading to incorrect or incomplete results.

4. To fix the bug, we can use the communicate() method of the Popen object to wait for the process to finish and then read the output. Additionally, we should handle any potential exceptions that may occur during the execution of the shell command.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        output, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    except Exception as e:
        return 'Error getting shell information: {}'.format(str(e))
```

In this corrected code, we use the communicate() method to wait for the process to finish and capture the output. We also handle any exceptions that may occur during the execution of the shell command.
