1. The buggy function is trying to get the version of the current shell, but it is not handling the process output correctly.

2. The potential error location is the way the function is trying to read and decode the output from the process.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the process output, which can result in incorrect or unexpected behavior.

4. To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the process output and decode it before returning the version.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    proc.stdout.close()
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
