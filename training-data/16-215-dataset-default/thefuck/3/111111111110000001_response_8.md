Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the `info` function is in the command used to retrieve the version of Fish shell. The command is 'echo $FISH_VERSION' which may not always return the proper version.

Bug's Cause:
(a). The buggy function:
The `info` function uses the 'echo $FISH_VERSION' command to retrieve the Fish shell version, but it may not always return the proper version, leading to an incorrect result.

(b). The buggy class:
The `Fish` class is not explicitly importing the necessary modules for the functions used in the `info` method, such as `Popen`, `PIPE`, and `DEVNULL`.

(c). Related functions:
The test function is mocking the behavior of `Popen` to return a specific stdout output. However, the actual `info` function does not use `Popen` correctly to fetch the Fish shell version.

(d). The failing test and error message:
The failing test checks if the output of the `info` function matches the expected version of Fish shell. The error message shows that the actual output includes unnecessary characters and does not match the expected output.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Change the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version to ensure it returns the correct version.
2. Properly import the required modules in the `Fish` class to use the `Popen`, `PIPE`, and `DEVNULL` functions without any issues.

Corrected code for the `info` function:
```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```
Now, the corrected `info` function uses the correct command ('fish --version') to retrieve the Fish shell version and returns it in the expected format.
