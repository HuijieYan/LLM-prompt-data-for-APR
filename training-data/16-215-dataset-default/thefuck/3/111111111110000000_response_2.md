```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL, encoding='utf-8')  # Added encoding='utf-8'
        version = proc.communicate()[0].strip()  # Changed to use communicate() method
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)  # Removed u prefix

```
By adding the `encoding='utf-8'`, `communicate()` method and removing the `u` prefix, the function should now work as expected and pass the failing test.
