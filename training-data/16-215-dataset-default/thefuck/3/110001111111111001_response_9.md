The issue in the `info` function seems to be with the command used to get the fish shell version. The current command is `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`, but the test is expecting the output of `['fish', '--version']`. Additionally, the format of the version is different between the actual and expected output.

To fix the bug, the command used to get the fish shell version should be updated to `['fish', '--version']`. Additionally, the format of the version should be modified to match the expected output.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extracting the version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this fix, the `info` function should now return the version of the fish shell in the correct format and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
