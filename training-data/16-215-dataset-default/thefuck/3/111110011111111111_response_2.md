1. The problem seems to be in the `info` function of the `Fish` class. The function is trying to run a command to get the version of the Fish shell, but it is not using the correct command, and thus the version returned is not what the test expects. The failing test is expecting the version to be in a specific format, but the function is returning a different format.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the command being passed to Popen. It seems like the command being used to get the version of the Fish shell is incorrect.

3. The cause of the bug is that the command being used to get the version of the Fish shell is incorrect. The failing test expects the version in a specific format, but the function is returning a different format. This causes the assertion error in the failing test.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Use the correct command to get the version of the Fish shell
   - Format the version string to match the expected format in the failing test
   - Update the Popen call to use the correct command and handle the output accordingly

5. Here is the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.replace('fish, version ', '')
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected code, the function will return the version of the Fish shell in the expected format, passing the failing test and resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
