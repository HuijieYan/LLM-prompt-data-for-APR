Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the problematic function is the command used to fetch the Fish shell version. The command 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION' may not be returning the expected version format, which causes the tests to fail.

Bug's Cause:
The cause of the bug is that the function 'info' is not correctly fetching the Fish shell version. As a result, the expected version format is not being obtained, leading to failures in the tests.

Suggested Approach for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the command used to fetch the Fish shell version in the 'info' function. Additionally, we need to ensure that the output is in the expected format.

Corrected Code:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL  # add this import if not already present

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'fish --version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell, version {}'.format(version)
```

The corrected code uses 'fish --version' to fetch the Fish shell version, and the format of the returned version is adjusted to match the expected output. This should resolve the issue and produce the expected results.
