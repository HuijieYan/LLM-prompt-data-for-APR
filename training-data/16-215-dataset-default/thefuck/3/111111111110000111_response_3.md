Potential error location:
In the info() function, when retrieving the version of the Fish shell, the command used is 'echo $FISH_VERSION'. However, in the failing test, the expected version is '3.5.9', and the returned version is 'fish, version 3.5.9' which causes the assertion error.

Bug's cause:
The info() function uses the incorrect command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell, leading to a mismatch in the returned version and the expected version in the failing test.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the command used in the info() function to correctly retrieve the version of the Fish shell.
2. Update the failing test to use the correct expected version of the Fish shell.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)

# Updated failing test
def test_info(self, shell, Popen):
    Popen.return_value.stdout.read.side_effect = [b'fish, version 3.5.9\n']
    assert shell.info() == 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'
    assert Popen.call_args[0][0] == ['fish', '--version']
```

This corrected code uses the correct command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell and updates the failing test to use the correct expected version. This will pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.
