The issue is with the command being used to get the version of the Fish shell. The command being used is `echo $FISH_VERSION`, which returns only the version number. But the test is expecting the command to be `fish --version`, which returns the version number prefixed with "fish, version".

To fix the bug, we need to update the command used to get the Fish shell version.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):
    # this is the fixed function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this fix, the function will return the expected version of Fish shell and pass the failing test. Additionally, it also resolves the issue posted in GitHub related to the 'thefuck' plugin and Oh-My-Fish.

This fix updates the command used to get the Fish shell version, and the function now correctly handles the version information.
