1. The buggy function 'info()' is a method of a class and it attempts to retrieve the name and version of the current shell. The GitHub issue relates to the use of the thefuck plugin with Oh-My-Fish, which triggers a recursive loop due to the use of 'thefuck -v'. This results in the hanging of Fish Shell initialization.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of the Popen method to execute the 'echo $FISH_VERSION' command. This can be causing the recursive loop and hanging of the shell initialization.

3. The cause of the bug is that the 'info()' method in the Fish class is not handling the execution of the command properly, leading to a recursive loop and hanging of the shell initialization. This is confirmed by the GitHub issue, where the use of the thefuck plugin triggers the recursive loop due to the problematic 'info()' method.

4. To fix the bug, the 'info()' method needs to be modified to handle the execution of the command more effectively. This can involve ensuring that the command is executed without causing a recursive loop, and that the stdout and stderr are appropriately handled to prevent hanging of the shell initialization.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import check_output, CalledProcessError, STDOUT

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        version = check_output(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stderr=STDOUT).decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    except CalledProcessError:
        return "Unable to retrieve Fish Shell version"
```

In this corrected version, the 'info()' method uses the try-except block to catch any errors that may occur during the execution of the command. It uses 'check_output' to execute the command and retrieve the output, while also handling any errors that may occur. This should prevent the recursive loop and hanging of the shell initialization as mentioned in the GitHub issue.
