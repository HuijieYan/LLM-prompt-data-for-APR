The issue with the provided function is that it is using the `Popen` function from the `subprocess` module without importing it. This is causing the function to fail when executed.

To fix this bug:
1. Import the `Popen` function from the `subprocess` module at the beginning of the file.
2. Use the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object to get the output instead of directly calling `read()` on `proc.stdout`.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import subprocess

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = subprocess.Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)
    output, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected code, the function should now return the expected value and type of variables for the provided test case.
