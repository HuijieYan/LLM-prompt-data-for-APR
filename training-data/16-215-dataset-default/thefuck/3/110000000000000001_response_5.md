1. The buggy function, named `info`, is intended to return the name and version of the current shell.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of `Popen` without importing the necessary module `subprocess`.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `subprocess` module is not imported, which is required for using the `Popen` function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Import the `subprocess` module at the beginning of the code.
   - Use the `subprocess.check_output` method to capture the output of the command.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import subprocess

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    version = subprocess.check_output(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']).decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
In the corrected code, the `subprocess` module is imported, and the `Popen` function is replaced with `subprocess.check_output` to capture the output of the command. Now, the function should work as intended to return the name and version of the current shell.
