The potential error location within the problematic function is the command used to get the fish version. The Popen command is using 'echo $FISH_VERSION' which returns a string with an extra 'fish, version' text which is not needed and causes the failing test.

The bug is caused by the extra text 'fish, version' being returned in the version string which causes the assertion error in the failing test.

To fix the bug, the command used in the Popen to get the fish version should be modified to 'fish --version' which will return the version without the extra 'fish, version' text.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The corrected function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.replace('fish, version ', '')  # removing 'fish, version ' from the version string
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
