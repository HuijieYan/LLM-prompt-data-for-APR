The potential error location within the problematic function is the command being used to retrieve the Fish shell version. 

The bug's cause is that the function is using the incorrect command to retrieve the Fish shell version, causing it to return the version with additional unnecessary text.

To fix the bug, the function should use the correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version and then format the output to match the expected value.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With the corrected code, the function now uses the correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version and formats the output to match the expected value. This should resolve the issue posted in GitHub and pass the failing test.
