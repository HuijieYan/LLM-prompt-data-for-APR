The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)`. This line is not properly formatting the version string with the expected output.

The bug's cause is that the function is not correctly formatting the version string, leading to unexpected output.

To fix the bug, you can modify the info function to properly format the version string as expected. 

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'fish, version {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function now returns the expected value for the version and satisfies the expected input/output variable information. This correction should also resolve the issue posted on GitHub regarding the hang in Fish Shell initialization with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.
