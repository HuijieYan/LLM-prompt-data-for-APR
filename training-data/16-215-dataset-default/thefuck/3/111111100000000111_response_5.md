1. The `info` function within the `Fish` class is intended to return the name and version of the current shell. However, it appears that the function is not properly handling the process creation and reading of the version.

2. The potential error location is in the handling of the process creation and reading of the version from the output.

3. The cause of the bug is that the process creation and reading of the version is not being handled correctly in the `info` function of the `Fish` class. This is causing a hang in the Fish Shell initialization with the Oh-My-Fish plugin, as reported in the GitHub issue.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Use `subprocess.run` instead of `Popen` for simpler process creation and handling.
- Ensure proper error handling for the process creation and reading of the version.
- Check for any potential infinite loops or recursive calls that may be triggered by `thefuck -v`.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import subprocess

class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            result = subprocess.run(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL, check=True, text=True)
            version = result.stdout.strip()
            return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
            # Handle any errors that occur during process execution
            print(f"Error occurred: {e}")
            return 'Fish Shell (version unavailable)'
```

This corrected code addresses the potential issues by using `subprocess.run` for process creation, proper error handling, and returning a message if the version is unavailable. It should resolve the hang in Fish Shell initialization with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.
