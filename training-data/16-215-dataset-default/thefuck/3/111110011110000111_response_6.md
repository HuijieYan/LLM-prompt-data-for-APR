1. The buggy function is a method in the Fish class that is supposed to return the name and version of the Fish Shell. The failing test function is testing the info method. The error message from the failing test indicates that the returned value from the info method is not matching the expected value. The GitHub issue suggests that the problem is related to the use of the TheFuck plugin in Oh-My-Fish triggering a recursive loop due to the info method.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the command used to get the Fish Shell version.

3. Bug Cause:
   (a). The buggy function, info, is not returning the correct version of the Fish Shell.
   (b). The Fish class may have issues in executing the command to retrieve the Fish Shell version.
   (c). The failing test is not receiving the expected value from the info method, and the error message indicates a mismatch in the returned value.
   (d). The GitHub issue suggests that the problem is related to a recursive loop triggered by the info method when using the TheFuck plugin in Oh-My-Fish.

4. Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
   - Check the command used to retrieve the Fish Shell version and ensure it is correct.
   - Debug the execution of the command within the info method to identify any issues.
   - Investigate the use of TheFuck plugin and its interaction with the Fish Shell info method.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import subprocess

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        version = subprocess.check_output(['fish', '--version']).decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

In the corrected code:
- The Popen function is replaced with subprocess.check_output to execute the command and retrieve the Fish Shell version.
- The returned version is stripped and only the version number is used to create the return string.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
