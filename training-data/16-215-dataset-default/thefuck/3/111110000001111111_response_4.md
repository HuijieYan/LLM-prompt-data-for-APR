Analysis:
1. The buggy function is a method called "info" in the Fish class. It is supposed to return the version of the Fish Shell but is not doing so correctly. The input parameters are not provided, but the function uses the Popen class from the subprocess module to execute a command and retrieve the shell version.

2. The potential error location can be identified in the line where the 'proc' variable is used to run the command 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION' and retrieve the shell version. The method of extracting the version from the output of the command may be incorrect.

3. Bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function is using the Popen class to execute a command, but the method of retrieving and formatting the version from the output is incorrect.
   (b). The Fish class may not be handling the information retrieval properly, as it is not returning the expected version string.
   (c). There is a discrepancy between the expected version string and the actual version string returned by the function, indicating an issue with extracting and formatting the version.
   (d). The GitHub issue suggests that the use of the "thefuck -v" command triggers a recursive loop due to the buggy function, indicating that the function is not returning the expected version.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the method of retrieving and formatting the version from the output of the 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION' command.
   - Ensure that the Fish class properly handles the information retrieval and returns the correct version string.
   - Check for any recursive loops and address them if found.
   - Consider using a different approach to retrieve the shell version or use more robust error handling to prevent issues caused by unexpected behavior.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-v'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return 'fish, version {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected code replaces the method of retrieving the shell version by using the 'fish -v' command instead of 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION'. It also simplifies the version formatting to directly include the retrieved version. This should address the bug and provide the correct shell version.
