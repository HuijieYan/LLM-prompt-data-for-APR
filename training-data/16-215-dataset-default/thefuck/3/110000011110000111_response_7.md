1. The buggy function is 'info' which is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell. The failing test function 'test_info' uses the mock Popen object to simulate the shell command output and checks if the 'info' function returns the correct shell name and version. The failing test asserts that the returned value is 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' but actually, the function returns 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9' as seen in the error message. The GitHub issue indicates that the problem is related to the TheFuck plugin using the 'info' function, causing a recursive loop.

2. The potential error location within the 'info' function is in the line where it constructs the return value using the 'u' prefix and specifies the format of the version number.

3. (a). The buggy function returns an incorrect shell name and version, which is 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'.
   (b). The failing test asserts the expected and actual values, showing the discrepancy between the expected 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' and the actual 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'.
   (c). The GitHub issue indicates that the problem is related to the TheFuck plugin causing a recursive loop due to the initialization of Fish Shell.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the function to correctly parse the output of the shell command and return the appropriate shell name and version.
   - Update the format of the return value to match the expected format in the failing test.
   - Address the recursive loop issue caused by the TheFuck plugin.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(' ')[-1]
    return 'Fish Shell ' + version
```
With the corrected code, the 'info' function now properly retrieves the version number and returns the shell name and version in the expected format. This should resolve the failing test and the issue posted on GitHub.
