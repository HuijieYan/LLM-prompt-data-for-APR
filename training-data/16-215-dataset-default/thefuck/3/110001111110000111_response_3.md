Potential error location: The potential error location within the problematic function is the command used to get the Fish shell version. It is currently using 'echo $FISH_VERSION' to obtain the version, but the actual version is retrieved using 'fish --version'.

Bug's cause:
(a) The buggy function 'info' in fish.py is using the wrong command to retrieve the Fish shell version.
(b) The failing test is asserting the incorrect shell info due to the wrong command being used in the 'info' function.
(c) The error message shows the assertion failure due to the mismatch in the expected and actual shell info.
(d) The GitHub issue points out that the 'thefuck -v' command triggers a recursive loop, which is likely caused by the wrong command used to retrieve the Fish shell version.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Update the command in the 'info' function to use 'fish --version' to retrieve the correct version.
2. Modify the failing test to assert the correct command call.
3. Verify that the fix resolves the recursive loop triggered by the 'thefuck -v' command.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

class Fish:
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(' ')[-1])
```

By updating the command to retrieve the Fish shell version and parsing the output to extract the version number, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and resolve the recursive loop issue mentioned in the GitHub issue.
