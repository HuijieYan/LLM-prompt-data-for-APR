Potential error location: 
The issue lies in the handling of the upstream_option_index variable. The code is trying to handle the case where either '--set-upstream' or '-u' is passed in the command, but it is not properly handling the case where both are present. Additionally, the pop() function is being used without considering the fact that it changes the indices of the list elements after each pop.

Bug's cause:
The buggy function is trying to handle the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options in the command, but it is not properly checking for both options and not handling the list indices properly when removing elements from the script_parts list.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check for both '--set-upstream' and '-u' options separately and handle them accordingly.
2. Use a different approach for removing elements from the list, such as creating a new list without the specified elements.

Corrected code:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u and its arguments
    script_parts = command.script_parts.copy()  # make a copy to avoid changing the original list
    try:
        upstream_index = script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        script_parts.pop(upstream_index)  # remove '--set-upstream'
        script_parts.pop(upstream_index)  # remove its argument
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_index = script_parts.index('-u')
        script_parts.pop(upstream_index)  # remove '-u'
        script_parts.pop(upstream_index)  # remove its argument
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    new_command = replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
    return new_command
```
