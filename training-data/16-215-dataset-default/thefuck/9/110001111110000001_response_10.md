Potential error location within the problematic function is in the following code block:

```python
if upstream_option_index is not -1:
    command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
```

The error is caused by the fact that after the first `pop` operation, the list `command.script_parts` is modified, and the index of the second `pop` operation is no longer valid because the list has been reduced in size.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Instead of using two pop operations, use only one and adjust the index accordingly.
2. After popping the first element, consider using the same index for the next pop operation.

After considering the potential bug and the possible approaches for fixing it, here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index >= 0:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):  # ensure the index is valid after popping the first element
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # use the same index for the second pop operation

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
