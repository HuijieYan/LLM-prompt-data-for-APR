The buggy function is `get_new_command`, which is supposed to modify the `command` object based on the presence of certain elements in the `stderr` attribute. The function is also decorated with `@git_support`.

The failing test `test_get_new_command` is calling the `get_new_command` function with different `Command` objects and checking if the output matches the expected results. The error message indicates that an `IndexError` is being raised in the `get_new_command` function.

The GitHub issue mentions that the `git push -u myfork` command is not being suggested correctly and provides an example of the incorrect suggestion as well as the expected suggestion.

The potential error location within the `get_new_command` function is the line `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` which is raising an `IndexError` because `upstream_option_index` is being set to `-1` and then being used as the index to pop from the list `command.script_parts`, causing it to be out of range.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the case when `-u` is not present in the `command.script_parts` attribute, which leads to setting `upstream_option_index` to `-1` and subsequently causing an `IndexError` when trying to pop from the list.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `upstream_option_index` is not equal to `-1` before attempting to pop from the list. Additionally, we need to update the logic to handle both `--set-upstream` and `-u` cases correctly.

The corrected code for the `get_new_command` function is as follows:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # Need to pop again as the previous pop has changed the list
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected code, the `get_new_command` function should handle both `--set-upstream` and `-u` cases correctly and pass the failing test.

This should also resolve the GitHub issue as it addresses the incorrect suggestion for `git push -u myfork` and ensures that the correct suggestion is made.
