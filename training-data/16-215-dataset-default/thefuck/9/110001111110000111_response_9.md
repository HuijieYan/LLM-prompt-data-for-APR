The potential error in the provided buggy function is in the pop operation. Since the command.script_parts.pop is called twice inside the if condition without checking if the index is out of range, it results in an IndexError when trying to pop from an empty list.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the case where the --set-upstream or -u flag is not present in the command.script_parts list, leading to an attempt to pop from an index that does not exist.

To fix the bug, we can add a check to ensure that the index exists before performing the pop operation. We also need to handle the case where the --set-upstream or -u flag is not present in the command.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # If the next item is not out of range, then pop the next item
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected code includes checks to ensure that the index exists before performing the pop operation, and also handles the case where the --set-upstream or -u flag is not present in the command.

With this corrected code, the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub. The commands with -u or --set-upstream flag should now be processed correctly without causing an IndexError.
