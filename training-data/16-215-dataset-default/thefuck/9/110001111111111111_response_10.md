The bug in the function is caused by the incorrect manipulation of the script_parts list. This results in an IndexError when trying to pop the same index twice. The function is also not correctly handling the case when the --quiet option is passed.

To fix the bug, we need to first handle the --quiet option separately. Then, we should remove both the '--set-upstream' and '-u' options and their corresponding arguments from the script_parts list. Finally, we should construct the new command with the 'push' command and the extracted push_upstream value.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.shells import git_support
from thefuck.types import Command

# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if '--quiet' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--quiet')
        return command.script

    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected code, the function should pass the failing test and also resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
