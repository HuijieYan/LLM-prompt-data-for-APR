1. Analyzing the buggy function, it appears that the function is trying to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' arguments from the command's script parts and then uses the stderr to construct a new command. The related test function is testing this behavior with various input commands and expecting the output to be modified accordingly. The error message indicates that an IndexError occurred when trying to `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the usage of `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` without checking if `upstream_option_index` is valid. The error message indicates an IndexError here.

3. The cause of the bug:
   (a) The buggy function is trying to remove elements from `command.script_parts` using the index `upstream_option_index` without validating if the index exists in the list.
   (b) The related functions are not handling the case where the index might not exist in `command.script_parts`.
   (c) The failing test and error message clearly indicate that the index being removed might not always exist, leading to the IndexError.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check if `upstream_option_index` is not equal to -1 before trying to remove the corresponding element from `command.script_parts`.
   - Handle the case where the index might not exist in `command.script_parts` to avoid the IndexError.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # Check if the index still exists after removing the first option
        if len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected code checks if the index `upstream_option_index` is not equal to -1 before trying to remove the corresponding element from `command.script_parts`. It also handles the case where the index might not exist in `command.script_parts`, avoiding the IndexError.
