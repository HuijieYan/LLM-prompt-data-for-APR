The buggy function is `get_new_command(command)` which is decorated with `@git_support`. The function tries to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the `command.script_parts` if they are present, and then constructs a new command based on the remaining parts.

The failing test `test_get_new_command` is failing with an `IndexError` when `get_new_command` is called with a `Command` object and `stderr` as an argument. The error message indicates that the `pop` index is out of range.

The GitHub issue titled "Fix suggestions for git push -u origin" provides a detailed description of the problem by showing an example of how the incorrect suggestion is being made when using `git push -u`.

The root cause of the bug is that the code is trying to pop the `upstream_option_index` twice even if it's found only once. This results in an `IndexError` when trying to pop a non-existent index from the list.

To fix the bug, the popping of the index should only happen if it's found, and the suggestion to replace `git push` with `git push --set-upstream origin master` should be created taking into account the presence or absence of the `-u` option.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and address the issue reported in the GitHub issue.
