1. The buggy function is related to the GitHub issue as it is causing incorrect suggestions for the `git push -u <remote>` command. The GitHub issue describes how the suggestion was incorrect after a certain merge, indicating that the buggy function `get_new_command` is likely the cause of this issue.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic for removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts`. This logic seems to be removing the elements incorrectly, leading to the incorrect suggestions.

3. The cause of the bug is that the logic for removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` is not functioning as intended, resulting in incorrect suggestions for the `git push -u <remote>` command. The GitHub issue provides an example of the incorrect suggestion and describes how it should be corrected.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Review the logic for removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument to ensure it is correctly identifying and removing these elements from `command.script_parts`.
   - Confirm that the `push_upstream` variable is being extracted correctly from `command.stderr.split('\n')[-3]` and that it represents the correct remote branch.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected code removes the `--set-upstream` and `-u` options using the `remove` method and then extracts the correct remote branch from the `stderr`. This should resolve the issue described in the GitHub post.
