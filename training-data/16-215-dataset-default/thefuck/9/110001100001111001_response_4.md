The issue with the buggy function is that it is trying to pop the elements from the `command.script_parts`, but it is not accounting for the fact that the index of subsequent elements will shift when an element is removed.

### Bug Cause
The buggy function is not handling the removal of elements from the `command.script_parts` list properly, leading to incorrect manipulation of the array elements.

### Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug
1. Keep track of the indices that need to be removed and then remove them in reverse order, starting from the highest index. This way, the indices of the elements that are yet to be removed will not change.
2. Use a different approach to manipulate the `command.script_parts` list without relying on specific index positions, such as using list comprehension or other list manipulation methods.

### Corrected Code
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    script_parts = command.script_parts.copy()
    if '--set-upstream' in script_parts:
        script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
        script_parts.remove('origin')
    
    if '-u' in script_parts:
        script_parts.remove('-u')
        script_parts.remove('origin')
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In the corrected code, we make a copy of the `command.script_parts` list and then remove the elements from the copied list. This prevents the shifting of indices that was causing the issue. The rest of the function remains the same.
