The buggy function is `get_new_command` and it is related to the `git_support` decorator and the Command class. The failing test is testing the output of `get_new_command` with different input commands and checking against expected output. The error message indicates an `IndexError` in the `get_new_command` function, specifically on the line `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)`.

The bug is caused by pop operations being carried out on the index without checking if the index is out of range. This is leading to an IndexError when trying to pop a non-existing item from the list.

To fix the bug, we should add checks to ensure that we are not trying to pop from an index that is out of range. We should also update the logic to consider both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options for removal and consider the case when they are used with additional arguments.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove '--set-upstream' or '-u' and its argument from the script_parts
    remove_options = ['--set-upstream', '-u']
    for option in remove_options:
        if option in command.script_parts:
            option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(option_index)  # Remove the option
            if option_index < len(command.script_parts):
                command.script_parts.pop(option_index)  # Remove the argument if it exists

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the function will pass the failing test.
