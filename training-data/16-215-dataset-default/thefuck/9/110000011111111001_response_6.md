The issue with the buggy function is that it tries to pop the index of the command.script_parts list twice, even if the index is the same for both '--set-upstream' and '-u'. This causes an IndexError when the index becomes out of range after the first pop operation.

To fix this issue, we can use the `remove` method of the list to remove the elements from the list by value instead of index. Additionally, we also need to handle the case when the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options are not present in the `command.script_parts` list.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The corrected code for the buggy function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected code, the buggy function should now pass the failing test and satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided.
