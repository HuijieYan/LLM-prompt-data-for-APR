The buggy function is attempting to remove elements from the `command.script_parts` list based on the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u`, but it is not considering that if `-u` is found, then the index for `--set-upstream` would be incorrect. This leads to an `IndexError` when trying to remove an element from that list, as the index does not exist.

The solution to this bug is to separate the two `try` blocks and use an `if/else` conditional to ensure that the correct value is used for `upstream_option_index`. Then, the subsequent `pop` commands need to be adjusted based on the presence of the `-u` flag as well.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should now handle both cases of `-u` and `--set-upstream` properly, and the failing tests should pass.
