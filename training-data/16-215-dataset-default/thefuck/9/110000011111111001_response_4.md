The bug in the provided function is caused by incorrect handling of the index when removing elements from the `command.script_parts` list.

The buggy function attempts to remove elements at the same index twice, which leads to an IndexError on the second attempt. This is seen in the error message where it says "IndexError: pop index out of range".

To fix this bug, the function should only remove the element once, after finding the appropriate index.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index > -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # Also remove the argument after the option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should now remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument only once and pass the failing test.
