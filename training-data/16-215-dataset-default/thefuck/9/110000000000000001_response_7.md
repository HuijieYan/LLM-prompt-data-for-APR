1. The buggy function is trying to remove the "--set-upstream" or "-u" option and its argument from the command script parts. It then retrieves the upstream branch name from the command's standard error and replaces the argument of the "push" command with the upstream branch name.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the removal of the "--set-upstream" or "-u" option and its argument from the command script parts.

3. The cause of the bug is that when both "--set-upstream" and "-u" are present in the script parts, the second try-except block will always set the upstream_option_index to the index of "-u", even if "--set-upstream" is present before it.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Use an if-else statement to prioritize the "--set-upstream" index over the "-u" index.
   - Use a loop to search for both "--set-upstream" and "-u" at the same time and break if either is found.

5. Corrected code:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    option_indices = [i for i, part in enumerate(command.script_parts) if part in ['--set-upstream', '-u']]
    for index in option_indices:
        command.script_parts.pop(index)  # remove the option
        command.script_parts.pop(index)  # remove its argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
By using a loop and a list comprehension to find the indices of both "--set-upstream" and "-u" at the same time, and then removing them in separate steps, we can ensure that both options and their arguments are correctly removed from the command script parts.
