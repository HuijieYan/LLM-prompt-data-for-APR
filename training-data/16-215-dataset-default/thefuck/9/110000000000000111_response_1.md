1. The buggy function is related to the GitHub issue titled "Fix suggestions for git push -u origin" and the detailed description mentions that #538 broke git push -u myfork suggestions. The function is supposed to handle the git push -u command and remove the --set-upstream or -u argument and its argument from the command. It also extracts the push upstream branch from the command's stderr and uses it to replace the argument in the command. The GitHub issue provides an example of the incorrect output and the expected correct output.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic used to remove the --set-upstream or -u argument and its argument from the command.

3. The bug's cause is that it incorrectly removes the --set-upstream or -u argument and its argument from the command, leading to incorrect suggestions for the git push command.

4. Possible approach for fixing the bug:
   - Use the correct index of the --set-upstream or -u argument and its argument when removing it from the command.
   - Check for the presence of both --set-upstream and -u arguments and their respective indexes.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove '--set-upstream'
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove its argument
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove '-u'
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove its argument
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected code should successfully resolve the GitHub issue by correctly removing the --set-upstream or -u argument and its argument from the command, and providing the expected output.
