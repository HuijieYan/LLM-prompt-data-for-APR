Potential error location: The `get_new_command` function is trying to remove `--set-upstream` or `-u` from the `command.script_parts` list, but the implementation is incorrect. It is trying to remove the element at `upstream_option_index` twice, which is unnecessary and could cause an IndexError if the element doesn't exist in the list.

Bug's cause:
The cause of the bug is that the code is incorrectly trying to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the `command.script_parts` list. This is resulting in an incorrect suggestion when the `fuck` command is run.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options exist in `command.script_parts`.
2. If it exists, remove it from the list.
3. Get the suggestion for `git push` from `command.stderr` and then use `replace_argument` to generate the new command.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected code properly removes the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from `command.script_parts` if they exist, and generates the new command as per the requirements.
