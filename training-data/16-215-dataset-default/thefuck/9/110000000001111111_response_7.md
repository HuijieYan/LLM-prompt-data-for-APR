Issue:
The buggy function is not correctly handling the removal of "--set-upstream" or "-u" and its argument from the command.script_parts list. This is causing the incorrect extraction of "push_upstream" from the command.stderr in some cases.

Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the removal of "--set-upstream" or "-u" and its argument from the command.script_parts list.

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
1. Correctly remove "--set-upstream" or "-u" and its argument from the command.script_parts list.
2. Extract "push_upstream" from command.stderr in a way that does not rely on the removal of "--set-upstream" or "-u" and its argument from the command.script_parts list.

Code Fix:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove "--set-upstream" or "-u" and its argument from the command.script_parts list
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        del command.script_parts[upstream_option_index:upstream_option_index+2]
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        del command.script_parts[upstream_option_index:upstream_option_index+2]

    # Extract "push_upstream" from command.stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].partition('git ')[2]

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected function properly removes "--set-upstream" or "-u" and its argument from the command.script_parts list and extracts "push_upstream" from command.stderr. It should satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided and successfully resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
