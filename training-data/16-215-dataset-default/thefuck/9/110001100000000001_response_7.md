Potential Error Location:
The potential error is in the if condition for checking if `upstream_option_index is not -1`. This condition will never be true because `upstream_option_index` is initialized as -1 and then assigned new value during the try-except blocks. So, the if condition should be checking for equality `==` instead of `is not`.

Bug's Cause:
The buggy function is trying to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags and their arguments from the command. However, the if condition to check if `upstream_option_index` is not -1 is incorrect, so it does not remove the flags and arguments properly.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Change the if condition to check for equality == instead of is not -1.
2. Handle both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags separately in two different try-except blocks.

Corrected Code:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
