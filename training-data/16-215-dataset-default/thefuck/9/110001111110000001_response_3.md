The buggy function is designed to modify a git push command by removing the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument. The function then retrieves the suggested command from the git error message and replaces the original push command with it, while maintaining any additional arguments.

The error occurs in the buggy function when trying to remove an item from the command.script_parts list using the pop() method. The error message specifically states "IndexError: pop index out of range", indicating that the index provided to the pop() method is out of range for the list.

This most likely occurs when the code tries to remove the same index twice, once for each case of finding the '--set-upstream' and '-u' options. Only one of these cases should be executed, not both.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle the cases of both '--set-upstream' and '-u' separately, and avoid trying to remove the same index more than once.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        return " ".join(command.script_parts)
```

In this corrected code, we first check if '--set-upstream' is in the script_parts, and if so, assign the index to the upstream_option_index variable. Then we check if '-u' is in the script_parts, and if so, update the upstream_option_index accordingly.

We then check if the upstream_option_index has been updated and only proceed with removing the index if it is not -1 (meaning it has been found in the script_parts).

This corrected code should now handle the cases of '--set-upstream' and '-u' separately and should pass the failing test.
