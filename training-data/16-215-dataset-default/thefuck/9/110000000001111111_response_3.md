The buggy function is supposed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list, and then use the error message from `command.stderr` to suggest a corrected command by replacing the `push` command with the provided error message.

The bug in the function is that it incorrectly removes the last two elements from `command.script_parts` if either `--set-upstream` or `-u` is found, regardless of their values or positions in the list. This leads to incorrect processing of the command.

The correct approach to fixing the bug would be to:
1. Find the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` in `command.script_parts`.
2. Remove the option at that index, and the next element as well, from `command.script_parts`.
3. Then, use the error message from `command.stderr` to suggest a corrected command by replacing the `push` command with the provided error message.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
# Corrected function
def get_new_command(command):
    # Find the index of --set-upstream or -u in command.script_parts
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    # if the above try block does not find the index, look for -u
    if upstream_option_index == -1:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass
    # if either --set-upstream or -u is found, remove it and the next argument
    if upstream_option_index != -1 and len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index + 1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    # use the error message to suggest a corrected command
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected code ensures that the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument are removed properly from the `command.script_parts` list, and then uses the error message from `command.stderr` to suggest a corrected command. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread and also satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
