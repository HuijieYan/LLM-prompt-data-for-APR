The buggy function `get_new_command` appears to be designed to manipulate a git command and its arguments. The function has multiple issues:

1. The function is attempting to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the command, but it's populating the `upstream_option_index` incorrectly. Moreover, it doesn't handle the case when the argument for `-u` is also present.

2. The function is extracting the string "git" from the `stderr` message in an incorrect way. This is done to construct the corrected command.

3. The last failing test is expecting an incorrect output that includes `--quiet` option, which is not in the provided input or expected outputs.

Based on the failing tests, the error message, and the GitHub issue, the cause of the bug seems to be improper indexing and handling of the command arguments.

To fix the bug, the function `get_new_command` needs to be redesigned to correctly handle the extraction of the upstream option and its argument, as well as the construction of the corrected command.

A possible approach to fixing the bug:
- Adjust the logic for identifying and removing the upstream option and its argument in a way that properly handles both `-u` and `--set-upstream`.
- Refactor the logic for extracting the corrected command from the `stderr` message to ensure it captures the correct part of the message.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function based on the identified issues and expected behavior:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):  # Remove the argument if present
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip()  # Extract the correct part of the stderr
    corrected_command = "git push " + push_upstream.partition('git ')[2]  # Construct the corrected command

    return corrected_command
```

This corrected function handles the removal of the upstream option and its argument correctly, as well as the construction of the corrected command based on the `stderr` message. It should pass the failing tests and resolve the issues reported in the GitHub thread.
