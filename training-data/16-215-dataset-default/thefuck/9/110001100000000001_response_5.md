The potential error in the buggy function lies in the try-except blocks for finding the index of --set-upstream and -u in the command.script_parts. If the first try block successfully finds the index of --set-upstream, the value of upstream_option_index is overwritten by the second try block for -u. This means that even if --set-upstream is found, it will be replaced by -u if it exists, which is not the intended behavior.

To fix this bug, we can use a more specific condition to check for the presence of --set-upstream or -u in the command.script_parts and then remove it.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove its argument
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove its argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In the corrected code, we are explicitly checking for '--set-upstream' and '-u' in the command.script_parts and then removing them along with their arguments. This ensures that both --set-upstream and -u are handled correctly without overwriting each other.
