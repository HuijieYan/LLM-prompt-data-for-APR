The buggy function is supposed to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument from the command, then replace the 'push' argument with the value derived from the 'git push' command's stderr. However, it is incorrectly removing the option and argument at the wrong index and not handling the argument correctly.

The discrepancy between the expected and actual output is that the 'upstream_option_index' variable does not have the correct index of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option, and the 'push_upstream' variable is not being derived accurately from the stderr.

The GitHub issue indicates that after a certain change (possibly Pull Request #538), the suggestions are now broken for 'git push -u' and similar commands, and it includes an example where the suggestion is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we can take the following approaches:
1. Use the correct index for finding the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument within the command.
2. Extract the correct value for the 'push_upstream' variable from the stderr of the 'git push' command.
3. Handle the cases where the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument are not present in the command.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import Union

class Command:
    def __init__(self, script, stdout, stderr):
        self.script_parts = script.split()
        self.stderr = stderr

def git_support(func):
    return func

def get_new_command(command: Command) -> Union[str, None]:
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        index = -1
    
    if index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(index)
        command.script_parts.pop(index)

    for line in command.stderr.split('\n'):
        if 'git push --set-upstream' in line:
            push_upstream = line.strip().split('git push --set-upstream', 1)[1].strip()
            return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)

    return None
```

This corrected function uses the correct index for finding the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument within the command. It also extracts the correct value for the 'push_upstream' variable from the stderr of the 'git push' command. If the required information is not found, it returns 'None' to indicate that the function was not able to suggest a new command. This should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
