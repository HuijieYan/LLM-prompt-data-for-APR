The bug is caused by the incorrect removal of elements from the `command.script_parts` list. The function tries to remove the argument passed with `--set-upstream` or `-u`, but it overwrites the `upstream_option_index` without checking if the `-u` option is present. This results in an incorrect index when trying to remove elements from the list.

One approach to fixing the bug is to remove the specific element from the list only if it exists, without overwriting the `upstream_option_index`. Additionally, the function should handle the case when the `git push` command does not have the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected code, the function should now handle cases where the `git push` command does not include the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options, and it should pass the failing test.
