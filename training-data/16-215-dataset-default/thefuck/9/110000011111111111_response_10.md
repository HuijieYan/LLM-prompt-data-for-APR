The issue with the buggy function is the way it handles the removal of the "--set-upstream" or "-u" options from the input command. The function is incorrectly removing the options and their arguments in a way that causes an "IndexError" to be raised. 

The failing test is also indicating that the function is not producing the expected output. The last test case specifically shows that the function is not adding the "--quiet" option to the output when it should be included.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly handle the removal of the options and their arguments, and also ensure that the "push_upstream" variable includes the correct options.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        try:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument of the option
        except IndexError:  # If there is no argument following the option, do nothing
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    if '--quiet' in command.script_parts:
        push_upstream += ' --quiet'

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected code, the function should now pass the failing tests and provide the expected output for the given input values. Additionally, it should resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
