The buggy function is designed to handle the 'git push' command by removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options and their arguments if present, and then constructing the push command with the appropriate upstream branch included. However, the bug appears to be in the logic for finding and removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options and their arguments.

In each case, the 'upstream_option_index' variable is not being correctly updated with the index of the option when it is found. The code is currently using two separate try-except blocks to find the index of the '--set-upstream' and '-u' options, and is not handling the case where both options are present in the same command. Additionally, the conditional check 'upstream_option_index is not -1' is incorrect, and should be 'upstream_option_index != -1'.

The root cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle the case where both '--set-upstream' and '-u' options are present, and it is not correctly updating the index of the options when found.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated to:
1. Properly handle the case where both '--set-upstream' and '-u' options are present.
2. Update the index of the options when found.
3. Correct the conditional check for the 'upstream_option_index' variable.

Here is the corrected code for the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    for option in ['-u', '--set-upstream']:
        try:
            option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(option_index)
            command.script_parts.pop(option_index)
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This updated code correctly handles the presence of both '--set-upstream' and '-u' options in the command, and removes both and their arguments when found. It also retrieves the correct push upstream information from the stderr. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
