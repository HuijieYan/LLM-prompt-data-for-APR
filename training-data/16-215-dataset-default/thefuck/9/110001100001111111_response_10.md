The issue is with the handling of the upstream_option_index. The function is currently trying to find the index of '--set-upstream' and '-u' separately, and then removing them from the command.script_parts. However, the function is only checking if upstream_option_index is not -1, and then removing the element at that index. This leads to incorrect removal of elements from command.script_parts.

To fix this issue, we need to check for both '--set-upstream' and '-u' separately and then remove them from the command.script_parts if they are found.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_options = ['--set-upstream', '-u']
    for option in upstream_options:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected code should address the issue by properly checking for both '--set-upstream' and '-u' and removing them from the command.script_parts as expected. This will ensure that the function returns the correct new command as per the expected input/output variable information.

Additionally, this fix should also resolve the GitHub issue by providing the correct suggestions for 'git push -u' commands.
