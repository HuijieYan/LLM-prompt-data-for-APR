The bug in the `get_new_command` function seems to be related to the handling of the `command.script_parts` list when the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags are present. The function appears to remove these flags and their arguments from the list, but it does so incorrectly, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to pop elements from the list.

It seems that the function is not correctly handling the cases when the '-u' flag is present or when both '--set-upstream' and its argument are present. Instead of just finding the indices of these flags and directly removing them from the list, the function should also consider removing the argument of the flag when '-u' is present. Additionally, the function should consider removing both the flag and its argument when '--set-upstream' is present.

To fix this bug, the function should check for the presence of the flags and their arguments separately, and if found, remove both the flag and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected function should now handle the cases where `'-u'` and `'--set-upstream'` flags are present correctly. It should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
