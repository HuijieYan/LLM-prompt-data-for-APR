The bug in the function is caused by the incorrect removal of elements from the `command.script_parts` list. This leads to an `IndexError: pop index out of range` when trying to pop an element from an empty list. The function is supposed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command, but it fails to do so properly.

To fix the bug, the function should check if the `upstream_option_index` is not -1 after both `try` blocks and then proceed to remove the elements from `command.script_parts`.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected code, the function should now properly handle the removal of `--set-upstream` or `-u` and its argument from the command.

This should resolve the failing test and also fix the issue reported on GitHub.
