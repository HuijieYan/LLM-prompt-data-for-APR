1. The buggy function is designed to manipulate a command by removing certain parts and replacing others before returning the modified command. However, there are several issues within the function that need to be addressed.

2. The potential error location within the function is the manipulation of the 'command.script_parts' list. The code attempts to remove the upstream arguments '--set-upstream' and '-u' from 'command.script_parts', but it does not handle the case when one of these arguments is not present in the list.

3. The bug's cause is that the function does not account for the case when the '--set-upstream' or '-u' arguments are not present in 'command.script_parts'. This causes the function to throw an error or not behave as expected when trying to remove these arguments from the list.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   a. Checking if the upstream option index is -1 before attempting to remove the arguments from 'command.script_parts'.
   b. Using a try-except block to handle the IndexError that may occur when trying to retrieve 'push_upstream' from 'command.stderr'.

5. Corrected code:
```python
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    try:
        push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    except IndexError:
        push_upstream = ''
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
