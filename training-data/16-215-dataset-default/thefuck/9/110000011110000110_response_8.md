```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    upstream_index = '-u' if '-u' in script_parts else '--set-upstream'
    try:
        upstream_option_index = script_parts.index(upstream_index)
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The function `get_new_command` has been corrected to handle the parsing of the command script and the removal of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument. The script is split into parts and then manipulated accordingly based on the presence of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option.

The corrected version now correctly handles the removal of '--set-upstream' or '-u' and its argument, and the function `replace_argument` is used to replace the 'push' command with the correct push upstream.
