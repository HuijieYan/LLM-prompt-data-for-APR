1. The buggy function is a decorator `@git_support` that modifies the behavior of the `get_new_command` function. The failing test is checking the behavior of the `get_new_command` function with different inputs and the corresponding expected outputs. The error message indicates an index out of range error when trying to pop an element from `command.script_parts` list.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` line, where it's attempting to pop the same index twice.

3. The bug is caused by the fact that if the first try block executes and `upstream_option_index` is set to a valid index, then the second try block also executes and resets `upstream_option_index` to -1, which then leads to the IndexError when trying to pop an element from the list. This is evident from the failing test message and the error, which indicate the IndexError occurred in `thefuck/rules/git_push.py` at line 27.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the second try block does not execute if the first try block finds a valid index. This can be achieved by using `elif` instead of a second `try` block.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test.
