The bug in the provided function is that it is attempting to pop the same index twice from the `command.script_parts` list, which is causing an `IndexError: pop index out of range` for some input cases. 

The cause of the bug can be identified from the failing test and the error message. Additionally, the expected and actual input/output variable values also provide insights into the issue. The GitHub issue further clarifies that the behavior of the function has changed following a previous fix (#538), indicating a regression bug.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to handle the cases where `upstream_option_index` is found. Instead of popping the same index twice, it should only pop it once and then proceed to replace the argument.

The corrected code for the problematic function is provided below:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected function should now handle the index popping correctly and provide the expected command for the given inputs. It should also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub repository.
