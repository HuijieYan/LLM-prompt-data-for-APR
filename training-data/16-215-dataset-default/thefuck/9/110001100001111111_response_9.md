The bug seems to be caused by the fact that the function incorrectly handles the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option from the command's script parts, and also incorrectly extracts the push upstream from the command's stderr. This results in incorrect suggestions for the git push command.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly handle the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option from the command's script parts, and also correctly extract the push upstream from the command's stderr.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    script_parts = command.script_parts.copy()
    if '--set-upstream' in script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove the argument as well
    if '-u' in script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = script_parts.index('-u')
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove the argument as well

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected code should now satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided and successfully resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
