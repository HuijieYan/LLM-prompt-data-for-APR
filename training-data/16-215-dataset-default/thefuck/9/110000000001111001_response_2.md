The buggy function is intended to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' argument and its parameter from the 'command.script_parts' list, and then construct a replacement command using the 'push_upstream' variable. However, there are a couple of issues with the current implementation.

The main issue is that the function is not handling the removal of the '-u' option correctly. The code to handle this is not implemented properly as the 'upstream_option_index' variable is being overwritten by the second try-except block.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to properly handle the removal of both '--set-upstream' and '-u' options. Additionally, the construction of the 'push_upstream' variable should take into account different edge cases where '--set-upstream' or '-u' might not be present.

The following is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):  # Check if there's a parameter next
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the parameter

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected implementation, the function handles the removal of '--set-upstream' or '-u' and their parameters properly, fixes the issue with the 'upstream_option_index' variable being overwritten, and should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information for all provided cases.
