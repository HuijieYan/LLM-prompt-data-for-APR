To fix the buggy function, we can revise the code to properly handle the removal of the `--set-upstream` flag and its argument, as well as extracting the correct `push_upstream` command to return.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index > -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].replace('git push ', '').replace('the remote as upstream, use', '').strip()
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This updated code includes conditional checks for the presence of `--set-upstream` or `-u`, handles the removal of these flags and their arguments correctly, and extracts the `push_upstream` command from the `stderr` in a more robust manner.
