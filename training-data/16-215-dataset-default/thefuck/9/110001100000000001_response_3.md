Potential error location: 
The issue seems to be with the handling of the upstream_option_index. The code is using `is not` in the if condition, which is causing the condition to always be true, regardless of the value of upstream_option_index. This is likely causing the removal of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument even if it doesn't exist in the command.

Bug's cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect if condition that always evaluates to true due to the use of 'is not', leading to the option and its argument being removed even when they don't exist in the command.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use '!=' instead of 'is not' in the if condition to correctly check if upstream_option_index is not equal to -1.
2. Add a check to ensure that upstream_option_index is not out of range before attempting to remove the elements from command.script_parts.

Corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1 and len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index + 1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
