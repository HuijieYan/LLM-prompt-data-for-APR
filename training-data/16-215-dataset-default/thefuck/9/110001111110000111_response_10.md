Potential error location: The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` twice without checking whether `upstream_option_index` is actually a valid index in the list `command.script_parts`.

Bug's cause:
The failing test and error message indicate that the index of `upstream_option_index` is out of range, resulting in an `IndexError` when trying to pop the element at that index from `command.script_parts`. This is likely due to the fact that the code attempts to pop the element without verifying if the index exists in the list `command.script_parts`.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check whether the index `upstream_option_index` is valid before attempting to pop the element from `command.script_parts`.
2. Use a conditional statement to verify if the index `upstream_option_index` is within the range of `command.script_parts` before performing the pop operation.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1 and upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected code, the function should now properly handle the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and its argument, and pass the failing test. It should also address the issue posted in the GitHub issue.
