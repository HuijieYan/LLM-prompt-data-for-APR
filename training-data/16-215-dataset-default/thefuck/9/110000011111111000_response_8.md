To fix the buggy function, we need to update the logic for finding and removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option from the command, as well as extracting the 'push' target to be used in the new command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git,
    # which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        index = -1

    if index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(index)
        command.script_parts.pop(index)

    # Get the new push command by extracting the remote and branch information from the stderr
    # This is more robust than simply extracting the third-last line, as the position may change
    for line in command.stderr.split('\n'):
        if line.startswith('git push --set-upstream'):
            push_upstream = line.partition('git ')[2]
            return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)

    return " ".join(command.script_parts)
```

The corrected function now includes a more robust method to find the push_upstream value from the stderr. This method looks specifically for the line that contains 'git push --set-upstream' and extracts the relevant information to form the new command.

With this corrected function, all the test cases provided are expected to pass without any 'pop index out of range' errors.
