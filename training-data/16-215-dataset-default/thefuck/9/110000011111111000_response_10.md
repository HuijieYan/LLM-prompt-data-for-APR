The buggy function has an issue with the logic for removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options and their arguments from the command. Also, the code is not correctly extracting the 'push_upstream' value from the command's stderr. 

We need to remove the logic that pops twice from the command.script_parts list and instead only remove the item once, regardless of whether it's '--set-upstream' or '-u'. Additionally, we need to update the code to correctly extract the 'push_upstream' value from the command's stderr.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('use ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version should address the issues with the original function and provide the expected output for the failing test cases.
