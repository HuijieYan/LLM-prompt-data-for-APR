1. The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the `git push` command and replace it with a specific argument. The failing test is checking for various scenarios of the `git push` command and expecting a modified output based on the `stderr` message.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the removal of elements from the `command.script_parts` list using the `pop` method. The issue might be that the index specified for `pop` is out of range, causing an `IndexError` to occur.

3. 
   (a) The buggy function (`get_new_command`) attempts to remove elements from the `command.script_parts` list based on the presence of certain options (`--set-upstream` or `-u`). It also extracts a specific argument from the `stderr` message. However, it seems that there is an issue with the removal of elements from the list, which results in an `IndexError` as highlighted in the failing test's error message.

   (b) The failing test is checking for different scenarios of the `git push` command and comparing the output of the `get_new_command` function with the expected modified command. The error message indicates that an `IndexError` occurred when trying to remove an element from the list, specifically when the `-u` option is present in the input `git push` command.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check if the index obtained for `upstream_option_index` is valid before attempting to remove elements from the list.
   - Handle scenarios where the index might be out of range to prevent the `IndexError` from occurring.
   - Ensure that the correct element is being removed from the list based on the presence of the `-u` option.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Potential corrected version of the buggy function
def get_new_command(command):
    script_parts = command.script_parts[:]
    if '--set-upstream' in script_parts:
        script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in script_parts:
        script_parts.remove('-u')

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By making the above changes, we are removing the elements from a copy of the `command.script_parts` list, and both the failing test and the subsequent test cases should pass.
