After analyzing the buggy function and the related GitHub issue, the potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of the `upstream_option_index` variable and the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` arguments from the `command.script_parts`.

The cause of the bug is that the code is not properly handling the removal of `--set-upstream` or `-u` arguments from the `command.script_parts`, which leads to incorrect suggestions for the git push command.

To fix the bug, the code needs to properly handle the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` arguments and ensure that the correct suggestion for the git push command is generated.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected code properly removes the `--set-upstream` or `-u` arguments from the `command.script_parts` and ensures that the correct suggestion for the git push command is generated, resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
