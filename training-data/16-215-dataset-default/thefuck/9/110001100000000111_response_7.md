Potential error location within the problematic function:
The `push_upstream` variable is calculated using `command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]`. This assumes that the error message in the `command.stderr` has a specific structure, which may not always be the case. This could lead to an index out of range error if the error message does not match the expected format.

Bug's cause:
The bug is likely caused by the assumption that the error message from the `command.stderr` will always be in a specific format. If the error message changes in any way, the code will break. This is evident from the GitHub issue, where the error message is different from what is expected in the code.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the error message contains the required information before attempting to extract it.
2. Use a more robust method to extract the necessary information from the error message.

Corrected code:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')

    push_upstream = None
    for line in command.stderr.split('\n'):
        if line.strip().startswith('To push the current branch') and line.strip().endswith('use'):
            push_upstream = line.split('use')[1].strip()
            break

    if push_upstream:
        new_command = " ".join(command.script_parts) + ' ' + push_upstream
        return new_command
    else:
        return command.script
```

This corrected code fixes the issue by first removing `--set-upstream` and `-u` options from the command arguments. Then, it searches for the necessary information in the error message and constructs a new command based on that information. This approach is more robust and should handle different error messages correctly.
