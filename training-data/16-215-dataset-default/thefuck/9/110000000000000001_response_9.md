1. The function is designed to remove the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument from the command, then replace the 'push' command with the push_upstream value extracted from the stderr output.

2. The potential error location is within the try-except block that searches for the index of '--set-upstream' and '-u' in the script_parts list.
3. The bug's cause is that the code to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument is not working properly due to the incorrect usage of list.pop() method.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could be using the remove() method instead of pop() to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument. Additionally, error handling for the case where push_upstream is not found in the stderr output should be added.

5. Corrected code:

```python
# This is the corrected version of the function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        if option in command.script_parts:
            index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(index)  # removing the option
            command.script_parts.pop(index)  # removing its argument
    
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    push_upstream = stderr_lines[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    if 'push' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts[command.script_parts.index('push')] = push_upstream
    else:
        command.script_parts.append(push_upstream)
        
    return " ".join(command.script_parts)
```
