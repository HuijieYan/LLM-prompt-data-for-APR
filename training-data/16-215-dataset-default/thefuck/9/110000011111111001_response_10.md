The bug is in the following code block:
```python
if upstream_option_index is not -1:
    command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
```
In this block, `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` is called twice, which is causing an `IndexError` in the cases where `upstream_option_index` is not -1.

To fix this issue, we should only pop the element once.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected code, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
