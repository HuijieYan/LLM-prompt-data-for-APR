1. The buggy function is taking a command as input and trying to modify it based on certain conditions. It is then attempting to extract a portion of the output of the command and use it to replace an argument in the modified command.

2. The potential error location within the function is the way it is trying to find and remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option from the command.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is using the 'index' method to find the position of '--set-upstream or '-u' in the 'command.script_parts' list. If the option is not found, it does not handle the error properly and may introduce errors in the subsequent processing.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Using a conditional check to find and remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option from the 'command.script_parts' list.
   - Handling the error when the option is not found in a way that prevents the code from attempting to modify the list if the option is not present.

5. Corrected code:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        if option in command.script_parts:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    try:
        push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
    except IndexError:
        return "Error: Unable to retrieve push upstream"
```

In the corrected code, we use a loop to check for both '--set-upstream' and '-u' options in the 'command.script_parts' list. If found, we remove the option and its argument. We also handle the potential error when trying to extract the push upstream from the command output by using a try-except block. If an IndexError occurs, we return an error message indicating that the push upstream could not be retrieved.
