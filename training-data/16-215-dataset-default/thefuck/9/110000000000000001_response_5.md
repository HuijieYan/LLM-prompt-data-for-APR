The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of 'upstream_option_index' to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument from the command.

The bug's cause is that the code does not correctly handle the situation when both '--set-upstream' and '-u' options are present in the command. Also, the use of 'command.stderr.split('\n')[-3]' to extract the push upstream might not be reliable if the error message format changes.

To fix the bug, we can use a more robust method to extract the push upstream and correctly handle the removal of '--set-upstream' and '-u' options.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# this is the fixed function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u option and its argument
    for option in ['-u', '--set-upstream']:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove the option
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove its argument
        except ValueError:
            pass

    # Extract the push upstream from stderr
    push_upstream = ''
    if 'git ' in command.stderr:
        push_upstream = command.stderr.split('git ')[-1].strip()

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In the corrected code, a loop is used to iterate through both '--set-upstream' and '-u' options, and their respective arguments are removed if present. Then, a more robust method is used to extract the push upstream from the stderr, and the code is updated to handle this extraction properly.
