The buggy function is failing to correctly identify and remove the --set-upstream or -u options from the input `command.script_parts` list. This is resulting in the incorrect extraction of `push_upstream` from the `command.stderr`, leading to incorrect output.

The cause of the bug seems to be the incorrect implementation of the logic to remove the --set-upstream or -u options from the `command.script_parts` list. This is evident in the actual output of the `push_upstream` variable, which includes these options.

To fix this bug, the logic to remove the --set-upstream or -u options from the `command.script_parts` list needs to be corrected. Additionally, the extraction of `push_upstream` from the `command.stderr` should be revamped to ensure correct parsing.

```python
from thefuck.utils import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    new_script_parts = []
    for part in command.script_parts:
        if part in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
            continue
        new_script_parts.append(part)
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].split()[-1]

    return replace_argument(" ".join(new_script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected code fixes the logic to remove the --set-upstream or -u options from the `command.script_parts` list and correctly extracts `push_upstream` from the `command.stderr`. It should now satisfy all the provided expected input/output variable information and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub.
