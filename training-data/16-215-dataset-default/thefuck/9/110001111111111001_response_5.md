The bug in the function is caused by the removal of an item from the list while iterating through it. Specifically, the `pop()` function is called twice, potentially removing the same index twice, causing an `IndexError` if the index is out of range after the first call to `pop()`.

To fix this bug, we can use a different approach to remove the item from the list. We can first check if the index is not `-1` and then remove the items from the list using the `del` keyword.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    if upstream_option_index == -1:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        del command.script_parts[upstream_option_index]
        del command.script_parts[upstream_option_index]

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
