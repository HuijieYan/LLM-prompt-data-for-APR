The buggy function is failing to correctly handle the removal of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options from the `command.script_parts` list.

The root cause of the bug is that when the function removes the first occurrence of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option, it does not take into account the possibility that the respective index of the second occurrence is shifted by the removal of the first one. This causes an 'IndexError' when attempting to remove the same index again.

To fix this issue, we can use the 'remove' method instead of 'pop' to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options from the list.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected function should now handle the removal of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options correctly and pass the failing test case while satisfying the expected input/output variable information provided.
