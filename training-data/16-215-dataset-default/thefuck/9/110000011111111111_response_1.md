The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts`, and then construct a new command with the corrected push argument.

The error seems to be occurring because the function tries to pop the same index twice, resulting in an `IndexError`. This occurs when the `upstream_option_index` is found and removed from the `command.script_parts`, then the same index is removed again, leading to the error.

The failing test and error message indicate that the function is not correctly handling the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument, and it is also not constructing the new command properly based on the given input parameters.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument, as well as construct the new command with the corrected push argument.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        if len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index:  # Remove the argument if present
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected code, the function should now handle the removal of the option and its argument correctly, and construct the new command based on the given input parameters.

This should resolve the issue reported in the failing test, and also address the GitHub issue related to this bug.
