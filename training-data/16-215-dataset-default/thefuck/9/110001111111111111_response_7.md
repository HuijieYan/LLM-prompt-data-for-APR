The issue with the buggy function is that it doesn't handle the case where the `-u` option is present in the `command.script_parts` correctly. In the current implementation, it simply removes the `-u` option and the following argument without checking if it exists in the list.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the `-u` option exists in the `command.script_parts` list before attempting to remove it. Additionally, we need to correctly split the `push_upstream` string to remove the `-u` option if it exists in the input command.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    push_upstream = push_upstream.replace('-u ', '')  # Remove the -u option if it exists
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected code includes checks to see if the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is present in the input command and removes it accordingly. It also replaces `-u` in the `push_upstream` string if it exists.

With this corrected code, the failing test should pass and the bug should be fixed. The corrected code also aligns with the expected input/output variable information and should resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
