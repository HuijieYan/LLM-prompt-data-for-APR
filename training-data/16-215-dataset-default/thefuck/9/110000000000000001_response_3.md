Potential Error Location: 
The potential error in the code is the if statement that checks if upstream_option_index is not -1.

Bug's Cause:
The bug occurs because the if statement to check if upstream_option_index is not -1 is using "is not" instead of "!=". This makes the condition always true, causing the subsequent code to execute even when upstream_option_index is indeed -1.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Change the "is not" to "!=" in the if statement.
2. Use a single try-except block to handle both '--set-upstream' and '-u' cases.

Corrected Code:
```python
# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1

    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
