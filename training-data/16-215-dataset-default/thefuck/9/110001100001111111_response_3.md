The bug in the provided function is that it incorrectly handles the removal of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option from the 'git push' command. Additionally, it incorrectly extracts the suggested command from the 'command.stderr' variable.

The discrepancies between the expected and actual input/output variable values are mainly due to the mishandling of the removal of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and the incorrect extraction of the suggested command.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle the removal of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option from the `command.script_parts` list, and extract the suggested command from the `command.stderr` variable.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u from script_parts
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')

    # Extract the suggested command from stderr
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.strip().split('\n')
    push_upstream = stderr_lines[-3].split('git ')[-1]

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected code should now handle the removal of '--set-upstream' or '-u' options correctly and extract the suggested command from the `command.stderr` variable as intended.

With this correction, the function should now satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided and successfully resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
