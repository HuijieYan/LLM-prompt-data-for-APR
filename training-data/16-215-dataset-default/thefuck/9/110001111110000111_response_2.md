The issue in the buggy function is that when trying to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' argument and its value from the command, it is not properly handling the case when both '--set-upstream' and '-u' are present in the command simultaneously. This results in an 'IndexError: pop index out of range'.

To fix this issue, we can use a single try-except block to handle both cases of '--set-upstream' and '-u' being present in the command and then properly remove both the argument and its value. Additionally, we should update the `get_new_command` function to handle the case when '--set-upstream' or '-u' argument is not present in the provided command.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
# Updated and corrected version of the buggy function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1
    
    if upstream_option_index > -1: 
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    stderr_parts = command.stderr.split('\n')
    push_upstream = 'origin master'
    if len(stderr_parts) >= 3:
        push_upstream = stderr_parts[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By making these changes, the function should now properly handle the presence of '--set-upstream' or '-u' in the command, and also handle the case when they are not present. This corrected code should pass the failing test provided and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
