The bug in the provided code is in the logic for removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option from the command.script_parts. The first error lies in the removal process, which removes both the option and its argument, leading to incorrect command formation. Additionally, the `push_upstream` variable is being extracted incorrectly from the command.stderr, leading to incorrect values.

To fix the bug, we should first ensure that the correct value is extracted for the `push_upstream` variable, and then fix the logic for removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option from the command.script_parts. We should also handle cases where the options appear multiple times in the script_parts list.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    skip_next = False
    new_script_parts = []
    for part in command.script_parts:
        if skip_next:
            skip_next = False
            continue
        if part == '--set-upstream' or part == '-u':
            skip_next = True
            continue
        new_script_parts.append(part)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(new_script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected code should fix the logic for removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option, and extract the correct value for the `push_upstream` variable, satisfying all the expected input/output variable values provided.
