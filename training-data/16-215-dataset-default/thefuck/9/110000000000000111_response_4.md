1. The buggy function is designed to remove the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument from the git command. It then retrieves the push destination from the command's stderr and replaces the argument with the retrieved push destination. The GitHub issue relates to the bug where the suggestion for git push -u command is not correct due to the merge of a certain pull request (PR #538).

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of the upstream_option_index and the removal of the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument.

3. The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the upstream_option_index and the removal of the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument. This causes the push destination to be incorrectly retrieved and used in the suggestion.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check if both '--set-upstream' and '-u' are present, and handle them separately to remove both correctly.
   - Ensure that the push destination is correctly retrieved from the stderr.
   - Update the replace_argument function to ensure that the suggestion for git push -u is correct.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u and its argument from the command
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    # Retrieve push destination from stderr and replace the argument
    push_destination = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    new_command = ' '.join(command.script_parts)
    return replace_argument(new_command, 'push', push_destination)
```

The corrected code ensures that both '--set-upstream' and '-u' options and their arguments are correctly removed from the command. It also retrieves the push destination from the stderr and replaces the argument in the command. This should resolve the bug related to incorrect suggestions for git push -u commands.
