The buggy function is designed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option from the given command and replace it with a different argument. The failing test is checking whether the function returns the expected new command based on the provided stderr output and input command.

The error occurs within the buggy function's try-except blocks, where it attempts to find the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the command.script_parts list. If the index is not found, it catches the `ValueError` and continues to the next try-except block, potentially overriding the `upstream_option_index` set in the first block. The error message indicates an `IndexError` while attempting to `pop` an element from the `command.script_parts` list, which suggests that the correct index is not being captured.

The cause of the bug is that the `upstream_option_index` variable is not effectively capturing the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the `command.script_parts` list, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to remove elements.

To fix the bug, we can modify the try-except blocks to individually find the index and break out of the loop if the index is found. Additionally, we need to ensure that the `upstream_option_index` is not being set to -1 after the first try block, so that it retains the correct index for the pop operation.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    if upstream_option_index == -1:  # Check if it's still -1 after first try block
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1:  # Check if a valid index was found
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function incorporates checks to capture the correct index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` without overwriting the `upstream_option_index` variable, and also ensures that the pop operation only occurs if a valid index has been found. This updated version should pass the failing test.
