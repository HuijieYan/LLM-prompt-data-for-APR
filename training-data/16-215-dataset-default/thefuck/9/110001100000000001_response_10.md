1. The buggy function is a part of some larger codebase and it seems to be related to the git_push.py file. It is using a decorator called @git_support, which is likely adding some functionality specific to Git commands.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is when the function tries to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options from the command.script_parts list. There could also be an issue with accessing the last element of the command.stderr.split('\n') list.

3. (a) The buggy function tries to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options from the command.script_parts list without checking if they exist, which could result in a ValueError.

   (b) The function also tries to access the last element of the command.stderr.split('\n') list without checking if it has at least 3 elements, which could result in an IndexError.

4. To fix the bug, we can add error handling for the removal of options from command.script_parts and for accessing the last element of command.stderr.split('\n'). We should also consider checking if the expected elements exist before trying to access them.

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    try:
        if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
            command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
        if '-u' in command.script_parts:
            command.script_parts.remove('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    stderr_parts = command.stderr.split('\n')
    if len(stderr_parts) >= 3:
        push_upstream = stderr_parts[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        # handle the case when stderr_parts does not have enough elements
        return " ".join(command.script_parts)
```

In the corrected code, we added try-except blocks to handle the potential ValueError when removing the options from command.script_parts. We also added a check for the length of stderr_parts before accessing its elements. If stderr_parts does not have enough elements, we simply return the original command.
