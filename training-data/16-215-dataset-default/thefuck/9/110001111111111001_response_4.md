### Bug analysis
The buggy function is intended to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument and its value from the `command.script_parts` list, and then retrieve the `push` argument from the `command.stderr` to create a new command to return. However, there are a few issues:

1. For each of the cases provided, the `upstream_option_index` should be obtained separately for `--set-upstream` and `-u`. This is because both cases could occur independently and their indices need to be properly found and accounted for.

2. After removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument and its value, the buggy function is fetching the `push` argument from the wrong place in the `command.stderr`, leading to discrepancies between the expected and actual output.

3. The error message and traceback indicate that there is an `IndexError` occurring when trying to pop an item from the `command.script_parts` list. This indicates that the `upstream_option_index` calculated is incorrect for these cases, and the popping of an item from the list is not properly guarded by a condition to check if the index is within the range of the list.

### Bug fix
To fix the bug, we need to:

1. Obtain the `upstream_option_index` for `--set-upstream` and `-u` separately and correctly.
2. Guard the popping of items from the `command.script_parts` list and only pop if the index is within the range of the list.
3. Fetch the `push` argument from the correct place in the `command.stderr`.

A correction in the code can directly address these issues. Here is the corrected function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1 and upstream_option_index + 1 < len(command.script_parts):
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Pop the argument as well

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-2].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This fix separates the handling of the `--set-upstream` and `-u` cases, guards the popping of items from `command.script_parts`, and corrects the index used to obtain the `push` argument from `command.stderr`.

With these corrections, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
