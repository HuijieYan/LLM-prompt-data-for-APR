The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify a git push command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument, then replacing the `push` argument with the string that appears in the command's stderr.

The failing test for this function checks whether the modified command matches the expected output. The error message indicates an IndexError: pop index out of range at line 32, which suggests that the function tries to pop an element from an empty list, causing the error.

The GitHub issue indicates that the bug was introduced by a previous merge, and provides an example of the incorrect behavior along with an explanation of the desired fix.

To fix this bug, we need to handle cases where the index for `--set-upstream` or `-u` is not found in the `command.script_parts` list. We can use if statements to check if the index is not -1 before attempting to remove the elements from the list. Additionally, we need to update the logic for extracting the `push_upstream` string from the `stderr` to ensure it captures the correct value.

The corrected code for the function is as follows:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    try:
        push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-2].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    except IndexError:
        push_upstream = 'origin master'
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function should address the IndexError by checking for the presence of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options before attempting to remove them from the list. It also updates the logic for extracting the `push_upstream` string from `stderr` to prevent potential errors. With these changes, the function should now pass the failing test and provide the expected output.
