The buggy function is using the `split` method to check if the second word in the command script is 'stash'. However, in the case where the input is 'git', this method will result in an `IndexError` because there are no words to split. This is consistent with the GitHub issue description where the error is `IndexError: list index out of range`.

To fix this bug, we can first check if the length of the split script is greater than 1 and then perform the comparison. 

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) > 1:
        return (split_script[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```

With this fix, the function should now satisfy the expected input and output variable information and resolve the GitHub issue.
