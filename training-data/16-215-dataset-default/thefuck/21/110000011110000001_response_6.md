The error is occurring at the line `command.script.split()[1]` in the `match` function. This is because the `split()` function is trying to split the `command.script` into a list based on whitespace, and the index `1` is being accessed assuming that there will be at least two elements in the resulting list. However, if the `command.script` does not contain at least two words separated by whitespace, then this will result in an `IndexError` which is what is happening in this case.

To fix this bug, we can first check if the `command.script` has at least two words before trying to access the index `1`.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 
            and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By first checking if `len(script_words) > 1`, we are ensuring that we only access index `1` if there are at least two words in the `command.script`, thus avoiding the `IndexError`.
