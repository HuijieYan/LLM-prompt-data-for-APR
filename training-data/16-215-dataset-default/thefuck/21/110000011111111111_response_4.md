The error in the buggy function is an `IndexError: list index out of range` which occurs at line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)`. This error occurs when the `split()` function is called on `command.script` and there is no index 1 in the resulting list.

The failing test `test_not_match` is expecting the `match` function to return `False` when the `command.script` is `'git'`. However, the buggy implementation is throwing an `IndexError` in this case.

The expected input parameters are:
- command.script: `'git'`
- command.stderr: `'\nusage: git stash list [<options>]\n   or: git stash show [<stash>]\n   or: git stash drop [-q'`

The buggy function is splitting `command.script` using `split()` and then checking if the second element is `'stash'`. However, since `command.script` is `'git'`, there is no second element in the resulting list, leading to an IndexError.

To fix this, we need to check if `'stash'` is present in `command.script` before attempting to split it. If it is, then we can perform the comparison, otherwise, we can return `False`.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This implementation checks if `'stash'` is present in `command.script` and if 'usage:' is present in `command.stderr`, which should satisfy the failing test and the expected input/output variable information. This should also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
