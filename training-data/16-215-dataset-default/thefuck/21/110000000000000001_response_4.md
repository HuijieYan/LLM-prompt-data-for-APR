1. The buggy function takes a command as input and checks if the second word in the command is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is present in the command's stderr.

2. The potential error location within the function is the way the command's stderr is being checked for the presence of 'usage:'.

3. The bug's cause is that the current implementation does not handle cases where 'usage:' may be present in multiple lines of the stderr.

4. To fix the bug, we can modify the function to check for 'usage:' in each line of the command's stderr instead of checking it in the entire stderr at once.

5. Corrected code:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    if command.script.split()[1] == 'stash':
        for line in command.stderr.split('\n'):
            if 'usage:' in line:
                return True
    return False
```

In the corrected code, we split the stderr into lines and then check each line for the presence of 'usage:'. If we find it in any line, we return True, indicating a match. Otherwise, we return False. This fix ensures that we properly handle cases where 'usage:' may be present in multiple lines of the stderr.
