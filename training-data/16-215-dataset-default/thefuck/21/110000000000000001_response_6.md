1. The buggy function is using a decorator `@git_support` but it is not defined anywhere in the provided code. 
2. The potential error location is the decorator `@git_support` which is not defined.
3. The cause of the bug is that the decorator `@git_support` is not defined and is not applied to the `match` function.
4. Possible approaches to fix the bug:
   - Define the `@git_support` decorator if it is supposed to be used.
   - Remove the `@git_support` decorator if it is not necessary.

5. Corrected code:
```python
# assuming @git_support is not necessary
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
