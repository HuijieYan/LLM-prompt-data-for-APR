The buggy function, "match", is intended to check if the command script contains "stash" and if the command stderr contains "usage:". However, the bug occurs due to the use of `split()[1]` without checking if the script actually has multiple parts.

The failing test, `test_not_match`, fails because it expects the match function to return False when given a Command object with "git" as the script and an error message that contains "usage:". The error message from the failing test indicates that the bug is caused by an IndexError, specifically occurring at line 8 in the git_fix_stash.py file when trying to access `split()[1]` on an empty list.

The GitHub issue also provides additional information about how the bug is triggered by a specific command and includes a stack trace showing the location of the error in the code.

To fix the bug, the match function should be modified to first check if the length of the split result is at least 2 before accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This modification ensures that the split result is checked for its length before attempting to access the second element, preventing the IndexError from occurring. With this fix, the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
