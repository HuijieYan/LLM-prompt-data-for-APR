The buggy function `match` is a part of the `git_fix_stash` rule and is supposed to check if the given command is a git command related to the stash feature. The error message indicates an "IndexError: list index out of range" in the `match` function, specifically at the line `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`.

The failing test `test_not_match` is checking if the `match` function returns False for a Command object with the script "git" and a specific stderr related to git stash.

The GitHub issue provides the context that the error occurs when the script is just "git", and it includes the command usage for git, indicating that the `match` function should handle the case when the script is just "git".

To fix the bug, we can update the `match` function to first check if the script is "git" and if the word "stash" is present in the stderr. If the script is not "git", then it should split the script and check if the second element is "stash".

Here is the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if command.script.split()[0] == 'git':
        return 'stash' in command.stderr
    else:
        return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the `match` function will handle the case when the script is just "git" and also when the script is a git command with "stash" in the stderr. This should resolve the IndexError and make the failing test `test_not_match` pass.
