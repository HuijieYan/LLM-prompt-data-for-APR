Potential error location: The function tries to split the command script and check the second element to see if it equals 'stash'. However, it does not account for potential whitespace or other elements in the command script.

Bug cause: The function does not properly handle the command.script.split() if there are additional elements or whitespace in the command script.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Use a more robust method to check the command, such as regular expressions.
- Check for 'stash' as a substring in the command script instead of directly comparing the second element.

Corrected code:

```python
import re

@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
