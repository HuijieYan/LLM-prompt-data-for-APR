1. The buggy function `match` is used to check if the command passed to it matches the git command for stash and if the error message contains the word 'usage:'. The GitHub issue title indicates that the rule fails when the script is just 'git', which means that the `split()[1]` operation is causing the issue.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the line `command.script.split()[1]` because if the `command.script` does not have a second word, it will result in an `IndexError`.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is assuming that the split operation will always result in a list with at least two elements, which is not the case when the `command.script` is just 'git'.

4. To fix the bug, we can add a condition to check if the length of the split result is greater than 1 before accessing the second element. If it is not, then the function should return False.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    if len(script_words) > 1:
        return (script_words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```

This corrected code will handle the case when the `command.script` is just 'git' and prevent the `IndexError` by checking the length of the split result before accessing the second element.
