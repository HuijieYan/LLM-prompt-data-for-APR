The buggy function is trying to check if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is in the command stderr. 

The potential error location within the problematic function is the way it splits the command script and checks for the presence of 'usage:' in the command stderr.

The cause of the bug is that the current implementation of splitting the command script does not account for the possibility of multiple words in the script. Additionally, the check for 'usage:' in the command stderr is not accurate.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to split the command script properly and use the 'in' keyword to check for 'usage:' in the command stderr.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this corrected code, the function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
