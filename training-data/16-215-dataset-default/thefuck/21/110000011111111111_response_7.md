The problem in the buggy function is that it assumes the script command will always have at least two words to split, and then checks if the second word is 'stash'. However, if the script command has only one word, then splitting it will result in an IndexError.

The failing test provides us with an example in which the command is just 'git', and the script.split()[1] will result in an IndexError, causing the test to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the script has at least two words before trying to access the second word. If it does, then we can proceed with the comparison. If it doesn't, we can simply return False.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
# The corrected and fixed version of the buggy function
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    if len(words) > 1:
        return (words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
```

With this fix, the function will first check if the script has at least two words before trying to access the second word, thereby avoiding the IndexError. This corrected code should now pass the failing test and provide the expected behavior for the provided input parameters.
