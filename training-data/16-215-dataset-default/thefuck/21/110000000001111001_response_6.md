The potential error in the buggy function is the use of `command.script.split()[1]` without checking if the split will have at least two elements. This can lead to an "IndexError" if the command.script does not have at least two words.

The cause of the bug is that the function is assuming the split will always have at least two elements, which is not always the case.

To fix the bug, we can first check if the split has at least two elements before accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) > 1:
        return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
```

This corrected function checks if the split of the command.script has at least two elements before comparing the second element to 'stash'. It returns False if there are not enough elements in the split, avoiding the "IndexError" and ensuring that the function satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided.
