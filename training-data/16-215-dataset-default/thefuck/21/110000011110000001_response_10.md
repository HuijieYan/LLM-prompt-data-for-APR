The buggy function is a decorator called `git_support` that wraps the `match` function. The `match` function takes a `command` as input and checks if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr`.

The error message indicates an 'IndexError: list index out of range' in the `match` function. This suggests that the `command.script` does not contain at least two words, resulting in the `IndexError` when trying to access `command.script.split()[1]`.

To fix this bug, the function should first check if there are enough words in `command.script` before accessing the second word. Possible approaches for fixing the bug might include adding a condition to check if the length of `command.script.split()` is at least 2.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test.
