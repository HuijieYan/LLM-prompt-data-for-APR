The buggy function is a part of the `git_fix_stash` rule in the `thefuck` repository. It is used to match commands that should trigger a fix when the user has typed `git stash` with a wrong subcommand. The GitHub issue indicates that the rule fails when the input script is just `git`, and an `IndexError` is raised.

The potential error location within the problematic function is at the line:
```python
return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
        and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
This line tries to access the second element of the split command script, which is causing an `IndexError` when the script has only one element (as in the case of just `git`).

The bug is caused because the function is assuming that the command script will always have at least two elements, which is not the case. The input script 'git' does not have a second element, leading to the `IndexError`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the length of the split command script before trying to access the second element.
2. Also, consider checking for the presence of the word 'stash' in the script to ensure that it is a `git stash` command.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this corrected code, the bug should be resolved, and the function should pass the provided GitHub issue.
