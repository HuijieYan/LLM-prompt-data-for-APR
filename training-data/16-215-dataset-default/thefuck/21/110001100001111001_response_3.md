The problem with the buggy function is that it is checking if the second word (split by spaces) in the command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command stderr. 

The issue is that the split command only splits the string by spaces, so if the command.script is 'git stash list', for example, the function will only consider 'stash' instead of 'git stash'. 

To fix this, we should check if 'stash' is in the command.script instead of comparing the split value directly. 

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this fix, the function will now properly check if 'stash' is part of the command.script, which will resolve the issue observed in the failing test case.
