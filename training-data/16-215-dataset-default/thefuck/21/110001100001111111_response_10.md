The issue is occurring because the buggy function is trying to access the second element of the split command.script, without checking if there is actually a second element. This results in an IndexError.

To fix this issue, we need to add a check to ensure that the split command results in a list with at least two elements before trying to access the second element.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) >= 2 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will first check if the split_script has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. This should resolve the IndexError issue and make the function work as expected.

This corrected function should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided and successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
