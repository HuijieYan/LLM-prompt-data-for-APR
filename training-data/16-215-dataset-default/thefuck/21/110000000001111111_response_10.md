The buggy function is trying to check if the command script contains the word 'stash' and if the command stderr contains the word 'usage:'. However, the function is currently splitting the command script and checking the second element, which is causing an index out of range error when the script is just 'git'.

The bug's cause is the assumption that the script will always have at least two words when split. This assumption is incorrect, as some commands may only consist of the single word 'git'.

To fix this bug, we can first check if the length of the split script is greater than 1 before trying to access the second element.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    if len(script_words) > 1:
        return (script_words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```

With this correction, the function will now first check if the split command script contains more than one word before trying to access the second element. This will prevent the index out of range error when the script is just 'git', and the function will behave as expected.

This corrected code satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided and successfully resolves the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
