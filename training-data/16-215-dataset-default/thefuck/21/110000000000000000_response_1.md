Here's the corrected version:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def git_support(func):
    def wrapper(command):
        if command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr:
            return func(command)
    return wrapper

@git_support
def match(command):
    return True
```

In the corrected version, we have fixed the code by defining the `git_support` decorator function and using it to wrap the `match` function. We also added a condition to check for the specified logic and return True if it's met.
