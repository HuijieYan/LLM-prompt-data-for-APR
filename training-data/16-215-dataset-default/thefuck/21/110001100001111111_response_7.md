The problem with the function is that it is trying to access the second element of the split script without checking if it exists, which leads to an IndexError when the script is just 'git'.

The function is expecting the second element of the split script to be 'stash', but when the script is just 'git', the split script only contains one element.

To fix the bug, we should first check if the split script contains more than one element before trying to access the second element.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected code will check if the split script contains more than one element before trying to access the second element. It satisfies the expected input/output variable information and successfully resolves the issue posted in the GitHub issue.
