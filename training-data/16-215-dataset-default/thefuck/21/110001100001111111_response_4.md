The problem with the `match` function is that it assumes the `script` attribute of the `Command` object always contains at least two words, which is not always true. The error occurs when the `script` attribute has only one word, as in the input parameter of Case 1. This causes the `split` method to produce a list with only one element, resulting in an "index out of range" error when trying to access the second element.

To fix the bug, we need to check the length of the split command before trying to access its elements to avoid the index out of range error. Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_command) > 1
            and split_command[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this fix, the `match` function will first check if the length of `split_command` is greater than 1 before trying to access its elements. This resolves the index out of range error and ensures that the function works correctly for all cases, including the input parameter of Case 1.

This fix also addresses the GitHub issue titled "git_fix_stash rule fails when script is just git" by preventing the index out of range error in the `git_fix_stash` rule.

The corrected function should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided and successfully resolve the GitHub issue.
