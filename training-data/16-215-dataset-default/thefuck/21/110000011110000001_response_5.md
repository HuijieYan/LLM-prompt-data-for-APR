The buggy function is a decorator `@git_support` that is applied to the `match` function. The error message indicates an "IndexError: list index out of range" on line 32 of the `git.py` file. This suggests that the issue lies with the line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)` inside the `match` function.

The failing test is checking for a match when the command does not contain the word 'stash' in the script and also does not contain 'usage:' in the stderr. The error message confirms that the IndexError is occurring when trying to access the second element of the split command script, indicating that the command.script.split() is not returning the expected number of elements.

To fix the issue, we need to first ensure that the split command is returning enough elements to safely access the second element. Additionally, we should check for the presence of the word 'stash' in the script and 'usage:' in the stderr individually before performing further operations.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) > 1 and 'stash' in script_parts[1] and 'usage:' in command.stderr:
        return True
    return False
```

With this corrected code, the function should now pass the failing test.
