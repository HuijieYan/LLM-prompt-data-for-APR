1. The buggy function "match" is using the git_support decorator, which indicates that it's specific to the git command. The GitHub issue indicates that the error occurs when the script is just "git", which results in a list index out of range error.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`. This line is trying to access the second element of the split list, which may not exist if the script is just "git".

3. The bug's cause is that when the script is just "git", the split list has only one element (the script itself), resulting in the list index out of range error.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Checking the length of the split list before trying to access the second element
   - Adding a condition to handle the case when the script is just "git"

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) > 1:
        return (script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```
