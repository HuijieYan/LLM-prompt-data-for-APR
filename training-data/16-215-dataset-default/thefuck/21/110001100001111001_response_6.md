The buggy function is using the `split` method on the `command.script` without checking whether the script actually contains multiple parts separated by spaces. This causes an error when trying to access the second part of the split.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the split results in at least two parts before attempting to access the second part. We also need to check if the first part is equal to 'git'.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) >= 2
            and split_script[0] == 'git'
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected function will satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
