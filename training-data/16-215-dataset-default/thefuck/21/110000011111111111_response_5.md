The bug is likely occurring due to the assumption that the `command.script` will always have more than 1 word. This assumption is causing the `command.script.split()[1]` to result in an IndexError when `command.script` is just 'git'.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the length of `command.script.split()` is greater than 1 before accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
