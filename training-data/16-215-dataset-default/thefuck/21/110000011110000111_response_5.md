Analysis:
1. The `match` function is using a decorator `@git_support`, indicating that it is a part of a larger codebase.
2. The failing test is checking if the `match` function returns `False` for a specific input.
3. The error message indicates that the index is out of range when accessing `command.script.split()[1]` in the `match` function.

Bug Cause:
The bug seems to be caused by the assumption that there will always be at least two elements when splitting `command.script`. However, when the command is just "git", there is only one element in the split, leading to the index out of range error.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the split has at least two elements before accessing index 1.
2. Handle the case when there is only one element in the split.

Corrected Code:
```python
# Import Command class if not already present
from thefuck.shells import Command


# Updated match function
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
