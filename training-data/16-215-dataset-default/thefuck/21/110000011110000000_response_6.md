# The fixed version of the buggy function
```python
# this is the fixed version of the buggy function
def git_support(fn):
    def wrapped(command):
        return fn(command)
    return wrapped

# The fixed version of the buggy function
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (len(command.script.split()) > 1 and command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

The fixed version of the function includes a new `git_support` decorator and addresses the index out of range error by checking the length of the split command script before accessing the second element. This should resolve the index error during the test.
