The buggy function is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr`. However, it's not handling the case where there may not be a second word in `command.script`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is at the line `command.script.split()[1]` where an `IndexError` is being raised.

To fix the bug, we need to check if there are at least two words in `command.script` before trying to access the second word.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected function will handle the case where there may not be a second word in `command.script` and should now pass the failing test.
