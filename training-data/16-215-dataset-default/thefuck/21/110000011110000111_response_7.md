1. The buggy function is a decorator that is intended to be used with the `match` function. The failing test is checking that the `match` function does not return True for a specific `Command` object. The error message indicates that an IndexError occurred while trying to access the second element of the split result.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `command.script.split()[1]`, as it attempts to access the second element of the split result without checking if it exists.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `command.script` is not providing the expected input for the function. When the `command.script` is just "git", it does not contain the expected subcommands as required for the function to work properly.

4. To fix the bug, we can check if the split result has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. Additionally, we can add a condition to check if the first element of the split result is "git" before proceeding to ensure that the input is as expected.

5. Corrected code:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) > 1 and command.script.split()[0] == 'git':
        return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
```
