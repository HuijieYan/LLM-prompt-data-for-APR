The issue here is with the line `command.script.split()[1]` which is trying to access the second element of the split command. However, if the `command.script` contains only one word, then this operation will result in `IndexError: list index out of range`. This is why the failing test is producing this error.

To fix this bug, we can check the length of the split command and also compare the first element to 'git' to make sure that we are not trying to access an index that does not exist.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splitted_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splitted_script) > 1 and splitted_script[0] == 'git'
            and splitted_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this corrected code, the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. This will also resolve the IndexError issue posted in the GitHub issue.
