1. The buggy function is checking if the second word in the `command` script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command's stderr in order to determine if it's a match. However, the error is occurring because the script is just 'git', and it does not have a second word, resulting in the 'IndexError: list index out of range' error. This is related to the GitHub issue because the user is trying to run the `thefuck` command with just `git`, and it's failing with the mentioned error.

2. The potential error location is within the check `(command.script.split()[1] == 'stash')`. Given that the script is just 'git', this check will throw an IndexError because there is no second word to split.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function assumes that the `command.script` has at least two words, but when the script is just 'git', it does not have a second word. This causes the `split()` method to fail, resulting in an `IndexError`. The GitHub issue information confirms this by showing the error trace.

4. To fix the bug, we can first check if the script actually contains at least two words before attempting to access the second word. If not, then we can return False because it's not a match. This will prevent the IndexError from occurring.

5. Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def git_support(fn):
    def wrapper(command):
        if len(command.script.split()) < 2:
            return False  # No match if there are less than 2 words in the script
        return fn(command)
    return wrapper

@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected code first checks if the script has at least two words before attempting to access the second word. If it doesn't, it directly returns `False`, preventing the IndexError. This will resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
