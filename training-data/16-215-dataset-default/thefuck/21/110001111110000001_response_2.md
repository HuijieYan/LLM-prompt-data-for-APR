The buggy function is supposed to match a git command that includes 'stash' in the script and has "usage:" in the stderr. However, the error message indicates that there is an `IndexError` on line 8 of the `git_fix_stash.py` file. This points to the line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)` as the potential location of the error.

The cause of the bug is likely the assumption that the `command.script` will always have at least two elements after splitting, which is leading to the `IndexError`.

To fix the bug, we can first check if the `command.script` has at least two elements after splitting before accessing the second element. Additionally, we can also perform a case-insensitive check for 'stash' in the script.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1
            and script_parts[1].lower() == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will first check if the `command.script` has at least two elements and then perform a case-insensitive check for 'stash' in the second element. This should fix the `IndexError` and make the function pass the failing test.
