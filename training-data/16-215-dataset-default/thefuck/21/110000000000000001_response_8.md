1. The buggy function is using a decorator "@git_support" which is not defined in the code provided. Additionally, the function is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command stderr.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of an undefined decorator "@git_support".

3. The bug's cause is the use of the undefined decorator and the lack of clarity in the purpose of the function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Remove the undefined decorator "@git_support" if it is not needed for the function.
   b. Add error handling for cases where the script.split() does not have a second word to avoid an IndexError.

5. Corrected code:

```python
# define the match function
def match(command):
    try:
        return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    except IndexError:
        return False
```
