The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the command input is related to the git stash feature and if there is an error message related to the usage of git stash in the stderr. However, the buggy function is incorrectly checking if the second element of the split script is equal to 'stash', which is not a correct way to determine if the command is related to git stash.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the first element of the split script is equal to 'git' and if the error message contains 'usage: git stash' in the stderr.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[0] == 'git'
            and 'usage: git stash' in command.stderr)
```
