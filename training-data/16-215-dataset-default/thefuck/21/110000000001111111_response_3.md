The issue is that the function is trying to access the second element of the split script, even though there might not be a second element. This causes the "IndexError: list index out of range" as shown in the GitHub issue.

To fix this, we should first check if there are at least two elements in the split script before accessing the second element. If there are not, then we should assume that the match is False.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) > 1:
        return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
```

This code checks if the split script has at least two elements, and only then checks if the second element is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. This should fix the bug and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
