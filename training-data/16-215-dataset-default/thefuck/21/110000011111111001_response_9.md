The buggy function is using `command.script.split()[1]` without first checking if the script has enough elements to split. This causes an `IndexError` when trying to access an element that doesn't exist.

To fix the issue, we should first check if `command.script` has multiple elements before trying to access the second element.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

This will ensure that there are at least two elements in `command.script` before trying to access the second element, preventing the `IndexError` from occurring.
