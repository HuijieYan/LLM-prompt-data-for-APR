The buggy function has a syntax error in the use of the `split` function. The function should split the command script using spaces, but it is missing the argument for the `split` function.

To fix the bug, we need to split the `command.script` using spaces and then check if the second item in the resulting list is 'stash' and if the 'usage:' string is present in the `command.stderr`.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split(' ')[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this fix, the function should now return the correct values for the given input parameters, satisfying the expected input/output variable information.
