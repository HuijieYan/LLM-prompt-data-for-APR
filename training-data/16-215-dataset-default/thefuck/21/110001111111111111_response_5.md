The issue is caused by the buggy `match` function which tries to access the second word in the `command.script` while not taking into account the case when there's only one word in the script. This results in an `IndexError: list index out of range` error.

A possible fix for the bug would be to first check if the `command.script` contains the word "stash", and then check for the presence of "usage:" in the `command.stderr`.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (
        len(script_parts) > 1 
        and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
        and 'usage:' in command.stderr
    )
```

With this fix, the function will first check if the `command.script` contains the word "stash" and then proceed to check for the presence of "usage:" in the `command.stderr`.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. It will also successfully resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
