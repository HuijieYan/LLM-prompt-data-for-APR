The buggy function `match` is trying to check if the first word of `command.script` is "stash" and if the word "usage:" is present in `command.stderr`. However, the function is raising an `IndexError` because it is assuming that the script will always have more than one word, and it's trying to access the second word without checking if it exists.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `command.script` has only one word. We can also add a check for "stash" in `command.script` to avoid the IndexError.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This change ensures that the function checks if `command.script` has more than one word before accessing the second word, preventing the `IndexError` from occurring.
