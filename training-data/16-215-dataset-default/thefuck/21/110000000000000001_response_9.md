1. The buggy function takes in a "command" parameter and checks if the second word in the command is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is in the stderr of the command.

2. The potential error location within the function is in the conditional statement that checks whether the second word in the command is 'stash'.

3. The bug's cause is that the function does not handle cases where the command has fewer than two words, causing an error when trying to access the second word in the command.

4. To fix the bug, we can add a check to ensure that the command has at least two words before trying to access the second word. If the command has fewer than two words, the function should return False.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
# corrected version of the buggy function
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    if len(words) < 2:
        return False
    return (words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
