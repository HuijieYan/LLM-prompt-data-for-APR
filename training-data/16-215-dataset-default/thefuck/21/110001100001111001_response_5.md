The problem with the current implementation is that it only checks for the presence of 'stash' in the command.script, but it does not specifically check if the command is related to git stash. This can lead to false positives.

To fix this, we can modify the function to perform a more comprehensive check for the 'stash' command within the git commands.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

@git_support
def match(command):
    has_git_command = command.script.split()[0] == 'git'
    has_stash_subcommand = 'stash' in command.script.split()
    has_git_stash_usage = 'usage:' in command.stderr
    return has_git_command and has_stash_subcommand and has_git_stash_usage
```

This corrected function will correctly check if the command is a git command, if it includes the 'stash' subcommand, and if the 'usage:' message is present in the stderr. This should address the issues identified in the failing tests and provide the expected behavior.
