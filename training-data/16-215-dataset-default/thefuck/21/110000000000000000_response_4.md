The issue with the code is that it is using a decorator @git_support which is not defined. We can simply remove that and fix the function as below:

```python
def match(command):
    command_list = command.script.split()
    return (len(command_list) > 1 and command_list[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
