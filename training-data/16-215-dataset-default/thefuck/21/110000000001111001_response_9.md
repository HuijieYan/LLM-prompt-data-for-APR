The problematic function is using a `split` operation on the `command.script` without checking if it is safe to assume that the script will always contain multiple words. This is leading to an index out of range error when trying to access the second element of the split result.

The bug's cause is that the function assumes the `command.script` will always contain at least two words, and it directly accesses the second word without checking.

To fix this bug, we can add a condition to ensure that the split result contains at least two words before trying to access the second word.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 
            and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected function will check if the `command.script` contains at least two words before accessing the second word. If it does, it will proceed with the comparison as before. If not, it will return `False`.
