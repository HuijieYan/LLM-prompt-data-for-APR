The issue with the provided buggy function is that it is trying to access the second element of the list returned by splitting the `command.script`. However, the split function returns a list with only one element (in this specific case), and therefore, trying to access the second element results in an `IndexError`.

The GitHub issue also provides information on how the function fails with a traceback showing the `IndexError: list index out of range`.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the length of the split result is greater than 1 before trying to access the second element of the list.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) > 1:
        return (script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
```

This corrected code checks if the split result has more than one part before accessing the second element. This approach ensures that the function will not raise an `IndexError` and will also satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
