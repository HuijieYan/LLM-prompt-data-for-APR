The buggy function is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr`. However, the logic is incorrect as 'stash' is not necessarily the second word in `command.script`.

To fix this, we can split the `command.script` and check if 'stash' is in the list of words. We also need to change the condition to check if 'usage:' is in `command.stderr` instead of checking directly.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script.split() and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
