The buggy function is trying to match whether the command.script contains the word 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command.stderr. However, the current implementation is flawed and throwing an IndexError because it assumes that the script will always have at least two elements when split by spaces.

Based on the GitHub issue, it seems that the function is failing when the command.script is just 'git' without any arguments.

The bug in the code is caused by the assumption that the split of command.script will always have at least two elements. This assumption is incorrect, especially when the command.script is just 'git' without any arguments.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle the case when the command.script has fewer than two elements after splitting, and return False in that case.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) < 2:
        return False
    return (script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

The above code first splits the command.script and checks if it has fewer than two elements. If it does, it returns False. Otherwise, it proceeds with the original match logic.

This should fix the bug and make the function satisfy the GitHub issue as well as the expected input/output variable information.
