The potential error in the provided function is the use of the command.stderr to check for the presence of 'usage:' in the output. It's likely that the stderr check is not the correct way to determine if the command was successful.

To fix the bug, we should check for the presence of 'stash' in the command.script and then use the command's return code to verify if the command was successful.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[0] == 'git'
            and command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and command.return_code != 0)
```

In the corrected code, we check if the first word of the command is 'git' and the second word is 'stash'. We also verify that the return code is not 0 to determine if the stash command failed.
