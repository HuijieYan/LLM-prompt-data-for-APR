The buggy function is checking if the second part of the split command is 'stash', without checking if the split command has more than one element.

The potential error location is when trying to access the second element of the split command without verifying its length.

The cause of the bug is that when the split command has only one element, trying to access the second element causes an IndexError.

To fix the bug, we should first check if the split command has more than one element before trying to access the second element.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_command) > 1
            and split_command[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
