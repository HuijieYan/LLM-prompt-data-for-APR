The bug in the provided code is an IndexError that occurs when trying to access the second element of the split command.script. This means that the script.split()[1] is failing when the split list does not contain a second element, leading to the list index out of range error.

To fix this bug, we can first check if the command.script contains the word "stash" before attempting to split it. If it does, then we can split the command.script and check if the second element is "stash". This will prevent the IndexError from occurring.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if 'stash' in command.script:
        return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
```

This corrected function will now properly handle cases where the command.script does not contain the word "stash", and it will prevent the IndexError from occurring. It satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided and should also pass the failing test. This will also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
