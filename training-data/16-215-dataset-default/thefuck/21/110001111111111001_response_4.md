The problem with the current function is that it splits `command.script` and then tries to access the second element without checking whether it exists. This is causing the `IndexError` in the failing test.

To fix this bug, we can split the script and check if the length is greater than or equal to 2 before accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return len(split_script) >= 2 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

This corrected version will pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
