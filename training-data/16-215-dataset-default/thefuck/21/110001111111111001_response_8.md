The issue with the buggy function is that it is trying to access the second element of the split command.script directly, which will throw an IndexError if the script doesn't have at least two words.

To fix this issue, you can check if the split command creates at least two words and then check if the second word is 'stash'.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

This should address the IndexError issue and make the function pass the failing test.
