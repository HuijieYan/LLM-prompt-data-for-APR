The buggy function is using a split method on the command.script without checking if it contains any values. This is problematic because if the script is empty, it will raise an error.

The bug is caused by assuming that the command.script always contains at least one value after splitting it.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the command.script contains any values before performing the split operation.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
# corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    if command.script and len(command.script.split()) > 1:
        return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
```

With this correction, the function will first check if the command.script is not empty and then perform the split operation. This should prevent the error and the function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
