The bug in the provided function is that it is checking for the entire command.script to be 'stash', but it should only be checking the first element of the split command.script. Additionally, the `git_support` decorator needs to be imported and used in the function.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `match` function to split the command and then check if the first element is 'stash'. We also need to import and use the `git_support` decorator.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from thefuck.utils import git_support

# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[0] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly check if the first word in `command.script` is 'stash', and if 'usage:' is in `command.stderr`.
