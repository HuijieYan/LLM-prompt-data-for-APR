The problematic function is called "match" and it seems to be related to the Git support. The function is checking if the command script is "git stash" and if the word "usage:" is in the command's stderr. 

The failing test is expecting the output of the function "match" to be False when passed a Command object with the script "git" and the stderr message related to "git stash".

The error message indicates that there is an "IndexError: list index out of range" occurring at line 8 of the "match" function, where the split() method is being used with no safety check for the existence of the second element in the resulting list.

The bug's cause is that the command.script.split() is being used without checking the length of the resulting list, which causes an IndexError when trying to access the second element that doesn't exist. This is in line with the failing test and the error message from the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that the command.script.split() has at least two elements before trying to access the second element at index 1. 

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
