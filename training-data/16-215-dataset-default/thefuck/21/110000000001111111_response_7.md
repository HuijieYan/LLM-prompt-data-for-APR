The buggy function `match` is using the `split` method on `command.script` without checking if it's safe to do so. This causes the function to fail when `command.script` does not contain a space character, such as when it's just `'git'`.

The bug's cause is the incorrect assumption that `command.script` will always contain at least one space character. This assumption leads to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the resulting list from `split`.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if `command.script` contains at least two words before trying to access the second word. We should also check if the first word is 'git' to be more specific.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
# this is the fixed function
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    if len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[0] == 'git':
        return (script_words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
```

This fixed code checks if `command.script` contains at least two words and if the first word is 'git'. If both conditions are met, it then checks if the second word is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in `command.stderr`. If any of these conditions fail, it returns False.

This should resolve the issue reported on the GitHub page and also satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided.
