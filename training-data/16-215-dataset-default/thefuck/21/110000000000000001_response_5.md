1. The buggy function "match" is using a decorator "git_support" without defining it, which is causing an error.
2. The potential error is the missing definition of the "git_support" decorator.
3. The bug is caused because the "git_support" decorator is not defined, and it is being used in the "match" function without any implementation.
4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include defining the "git_support" decorator or removing it if it is not needed for the "match" function.
5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

If the "git_support" decorator is needed, it should be defined and implemented appropriately.
