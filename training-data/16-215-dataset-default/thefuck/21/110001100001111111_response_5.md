### Analysis
The function uses `command.script.split()[1]` to check if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash'. However, in the provided test case, `command.script` is 'git', which causes the `IndexError` since there is no second word to split. 

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused because the function assumes that the script will always have at least two words, which is not the case. This assumption leads to an error when the `command.script` has fewer than two words.

### Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug
1. Check for the length of `command.script` before attempting to access the second word.
2. Validate the command by checking if it starts with 'git' before splitting and accessing the second word.

### Corrected Code
Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1
            and script_parts[0] == 'git'
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This code first checks the length of `command.script` before attempting to access the second word and validates that the command starts with 'git'.
