The buggy function is a part of the `git_fix_stash.py` file, which is a part of the `git` specific rules in the `thefuck` project. The function is supposed to match a command if it is a git stash command and has a specific error message in the stderr. The failing test (`test_not_match`) is failing with an IndexError, indicating that the command.script.split()[1] is causing the issue.

The failing test is trying to assert that the command should not match, but it is failing due to an IndexError in the match function. The GitHub issue also confirms this, stating that there is an IndexError in the `git_fix_stash.py` file.

The cause of the bug is that the function is trying to access the second element of the split command script, but it is failing when the command is just "git" and does not have a second element.

To fix the bug, we can check if the split command script has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. If it does not, then the function should not match. We can also add additional checks to ensure that the stderr contains the expected error message.

Here's the corrected code for the match function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    command_split = command.script.split()
    if len(command_split) < 2 or command_split[1] != 'stash':
        return False
    return 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test and also resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
