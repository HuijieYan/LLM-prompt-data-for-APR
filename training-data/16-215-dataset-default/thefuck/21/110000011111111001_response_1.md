As per the error message and the given code, the issue lies with the line `command.script.split()[1]` in the buggy function. This line assumes that the `command.script` can be split using space and accessed with index 1, which is causing the `IndexError` when the split operation does not result in enough elements. 

To fix this issue, the function should first check if the `command.script` can be split into multiple elements before accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
# Correction for the buggy function
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the split operation more robustly and pass the failing test.
