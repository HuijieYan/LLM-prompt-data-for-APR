The potential error location within the problematic function is in the line `command.script.split()[1]` where it is trying to access the second element of the split command script. The error message indicates that an IndexError is being encountered, meaning that there are not enough elements in the split to access index 1.

The bug's cause is that the function is assuming that there will always be at least two elements in the split command script, but this is not the case for all possible input commands.

To fix the bug, we can add a check to ensure that the split command script has at least two elements before trying to access index 1. This will prevent the IndexError from occurring.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# the corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_split = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_split) > 1 and script_split[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this corrected code, the function will first check if the split command script has at least two elements before trying to access index 1, preventing the IndexError from occurring. This should make the function pass the failing test.
