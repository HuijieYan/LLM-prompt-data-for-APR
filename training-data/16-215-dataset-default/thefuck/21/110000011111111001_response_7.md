The buggy function is a decorator called `@git_support` which takes a function `match` as its parameter. Inside `match`, it checks if the second word in `command.script` is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in `command.stderr`. The error is occurring at `command.script.split()[1]` because it's splitting the script into words and then accessing the second word without checking if it exists.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `split()` has at least two elements before accessing the second element.


Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected code checks if `split()` has at least two elements and then accesses the second element to compare with 'stash', avoiding the IndexError.
