```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# The corrected version of the function
@git_support
def match(command):
    if command.script.split()[0] == 'git' and command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

The fix involves adding conditions to check if the command starts with 'git' and then splitting it to get the second part, and then checking if 'usage:' is in the command's stderr.
