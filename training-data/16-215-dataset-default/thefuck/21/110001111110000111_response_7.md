The problematic function `match` is a part of the `git_fix_stash.py` file and is used to check if the git command matches the 'stash' and has a certain error in the stderr. The failing test `test_not_match` in the `test_git_fix_stash.py` file checks if the function `match` returns False for a specific command, and it fails with an `IndexError`.

The error occurs because the function tries to split the command script and access the second element without checking if it exists, leading to the `IndexError`. This is evident from the error message, which shows that the line causing the error is `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to first ensure that the length of `command.script.split()` is greater than 1 before attempting to access the second element.

A corrected version of the code would be as follows:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

This corrected version checks if the length of `script_parts` is greater than 1 before trying to access the second element. This ensures that the function does not encounter an `IndexError` and satisfies the failing test. It also addresses the issue posted in the GitHub report.
