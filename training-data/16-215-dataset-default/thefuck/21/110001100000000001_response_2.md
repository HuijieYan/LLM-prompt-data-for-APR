1. The buggy function is a part of a larger codebase that supports the 'git' command. It uses the 'git_support' decorator to indicate that it is specific to the 'git' command.

2. The potential error within the problematic function is the use of `command.script.split()[1]` without checking if the script has at least two words. If the command is just 'git stash' then the split()[1] would throw an error as there is no index 1.

3. The bug's cause is that the function does not check if the split command has at least two words before checking if the second word is 'stash'. This can lead to an 'index out of range' error in the split command if there is no second word.

4. To fix the bug, we need to check if the command script has at least two words before attempting to access the second word. We also need to check if 'stash' is the second word before further processing.

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# This is the corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 
            and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected code, we first split the command script into words and then check if there are at least two words before attempting to access the second word. This prevents any potential 'index out of range' errors.
