Potential error location in the problematic function:
The error is likely in the clocs variable. It seems that the function is trying to retrieve the level number based on the index, but it encounters an issue with multi-index where it should handle tuple names differently.

Bug's cause:
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is unable to handle multi-index with tuple names, which leads to the KeyError. The issue arises because the function does not properly handle multi-indexes with tuple names and does not account for the possibility of tuple names in the index. The function tries to extract the level number using the `_get_level_number` method, but this method does not handle tuple names in the index.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the function to handle multi-indexes with tuple names by specifically handling tuple names in the index. 
2. Implement a condition within the function to check for tuple names and handle them separately from regular single-level index names.
3. Use exceptions to catch the KeyError and implement a different approach for multi-indexes with tuple names.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if not isinstance(i, tuple) else index.names.index(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```
The corrected code now includes the handling of tuple names in the index by checking if the element in clocs is a tuple. If it is a tuple, it uses the index.names.index(i) method to get the level number for tuple names. This modification ensures that the function can properly handle multi-indexes with tuple names and resolves the KeyError issue reported in the GitHub bug.
