The issue in the `_unstack_multiple` function is that it tries to access the level names directly from the variable `clocs`, which is a tuple and should be a list of levels. This causes the function to raise a KeyError when trying to access the index of the level names. 

To fix this issue, the function should convert the `clocs` tuple to a list and then proceed to get the level number for each item in the list.

The correct fix for the `_unstack_multiple` function is provided below:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    clocs = list(clocs)  # Convert clocs tuple to a list

    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    index = data.index
    # ... (rest of the code)
```

With this fix, the `_unstack_multiple` function should now work as expected and pass the failing test cases.
