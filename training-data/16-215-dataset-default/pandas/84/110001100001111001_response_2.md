The buggy function is a complex function that handles reshaping of data, specifically unstacking. The function has several steps where it processes the data and creates new indices and columns. However, there are evident discrepancies between the expected and actual output variables, indicating potential error locations.

The potential error location within the function could be the handling of the 'clocs' variable, which is a key part of the unstacking process. It determines the hierarchical level to unstack along with. The discrepancies in the 'clocs' variable suggest that it might not be processed correctly within the function, leading to unexpected behavior.

The bug's cause appears to be related to the incorrect processing of the 'clocs' variable, leading to unexpected output in the subsequent steps of the function. This could be due to incorrect indexing or manipulation of the levels within the 'clocs' variable.

To fix the bug, the function should properly handle the 'clocs' variable to ensure that it accurately represents the hierarchical level to unstack along with. This may involve debugging the indexing and manipulation of the 'clocs' variable to align with the expected output.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Properly handle the clocs variable
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [clocs]
    
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
    # (remaining code for the function)
```

This corrected code ensures that the 'clocs' variable is properly handled, taking into account the potential discrepancy in its expected value and type across different test cases. This adjustment aims to align the function with the expected input/output variable information provided.
