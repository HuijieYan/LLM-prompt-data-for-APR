The potential error in the buggy function lies in the way it is trying to handle hierarchical columns. The function `_unstack_multiple` is attempting to unstack a DataFrame with hierarchical columns, but it is not handling the hierarchical structure properly. This is evident from the use of `MultiIndex` and the manipulation of levels and codes.

The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect manipulation of the hierarchical column structure, leading to unexpected outcomes when unstacking the DataFrame.

One approach to fixing the bug could be to refactor the code to properly handle the hierarchical columns. This may involve a more careful and systematic approach to manipulating the levels and codes when unstacking the DataFrame. Additionally, making sure that the function is properly handling both Series and DataFrames is essential.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data
    
    unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    
    return unstacked
```

In the corrected code, we are simply using the `unstack` method of the DataFrame to perform the unstacking operation. This takes care of handling the hierarchical columns properly and eliminates the need for complex manipulation of levels and codes. This simplified approach should help in resolving the issue and producing the correct output.
