The error is occurring because the `_get_level_number` function is expecting strings as input for level names. We need to fix the function `_unstack_multiple` to use the correct input for the `_get_level_number` function.

Here's the corrected `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(c) if isinstance(c, tuple) else c for c in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

This change will allow the function to handle both single level name strings and multi-level names correctly.

This fix ensures that the function can correctly handle both single and multi-level index and that the `_get_level_number` function receives the correct input.
