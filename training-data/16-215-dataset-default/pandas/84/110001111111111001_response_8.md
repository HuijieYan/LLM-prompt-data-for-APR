The buggy function is the `_unstack_multiple` function from the `pandas/core/reshape/reshape.py` file. The `_unstack_multiple` function calls the `_get_level_number` function from the `MultiIndex` class, which is raising a `KeyError` or `ValueError` due to an issue related to the naming of the levels in the MultiIndex.

The failing test is related to unstacking a MultiIndex DataFrame. The error is raised when trying to get the level number, as it cannot find the specified level in the MultiIndex names.

The potential error location within the `_unstack_multiple` function is in the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`, where it is attempting to get the level number for each specified level.

The cause of the bug is that the function is trying to access levels using the names of the levels rather than the level numbers.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to accept level numbers as input rather than level names. This can be done by directly passing the level numbers to the `get_level_values` method of the MultiIndex, which will return the values at the specified level. 

Another approach is to modify the `_get_level_number` function to handle cases where the input is a level name, rather than a level number.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    group_index = [index._get_level_number(level) for level in clocs]
  
    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
``` 

By making this modification, the function should now correctly retrieve the level numbers from the MultiIndex and avoid the KeyError or ValueError. This corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
