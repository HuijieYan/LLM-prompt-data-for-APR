The buggy function is `_unstack_multiple` which takes `data`, `clocs`, and `fill_value` as input parameters. It appears that this function is designed to handle unstacking of multi-index columns from a DataFrame.

The function seems to be attempting to identify the levels and codes of the columns to be unstacked, create a dummy index, perform unstacking operation, and then modify the index and the columns accordingly. However, it seems to be encountering an error related to the naming of the levels.

The error message indicates that the function `_get_level_number` is throwing a `ValueError` or `KeyError` related to the level name not being found in the list of names. This suggests that there is an issue with how the function is handling the names of the levels.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the names of the levels are properly handled and used while unstacking the DataFrame.

The corrected code for the problematic function `_unstack_multiple` is as follows:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    if len(rlocs) == 0:
        unstacked = data.unstack(level=clocs)
        return unstacked

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    recons_codes = pd.Index(index.reorder_levels(clocs).codes)
    
    dummy_index = pd.MultiIndex.from_tuples(list(zip(*recons_codes)), names=index.names[clocs])

    result = data.unstack(level=clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    result.index = dummy_index
    
    return result
```

This code simplifies the logic by using the `unstack` method of the DataFrame directly and takes care of handling the names of the levels by using the `reorder_levels` method of the index and then creating a new `MultiIndex` based on the reconstructed codes. With these changes, the function should be able to pass the failing test.
