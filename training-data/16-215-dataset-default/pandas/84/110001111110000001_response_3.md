The issue in the `_unstack_multiple` function arises from the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`. This line is attempting to get the level number for each value in `clocs` using the `_get_level_number` function of the `index` object.

The error message indicates that it is unable to find the value 'A' in the list `self.names.index(level)`, where `self` refers to the MultiIndex object.

This error occurs because 'A' is actually a tuple ('A', 'a') as specified in the failing test, and the function is expecting a single level value, not a tuple.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `clocs` contains tuples representing multiple levels within the MultiIndex.

We can modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to iterate over each element of `clocs` and check if it is a tuple. If it is a tuple, we can then extract the individual level values and use them to get the level number. If it is not a tuple, we can directly get the level number.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # ... (previous code remains unchanged)

    # check if each element in clocs is a tuple and extract level values
    new_clocs = []
    for c in clocs:
        if isinstance(c, tuple):
            for level in c:
                new_clocs.append(index._get_level_number(level))
        else:
            new_clocs.append(index._get_level_number(c))

    clocs = new_clocs
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)

    return unstacked
```

With this modification, the `_unstack_multiple` function should handle both single level values and tuples representing multiple levels. It should now pass the failing test cases.
