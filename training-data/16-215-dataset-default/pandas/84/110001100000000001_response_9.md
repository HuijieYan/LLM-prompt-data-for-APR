Analysis:
The function `_unstack_multiple` is trying to unstack the input data based on certain conditions. It involves handling MultiIndex data and creating a new index based on the unstacked result.

Potential error:
The potential error is at the point where it checks if the input data is a Series or a DataFrame with MultiIndex columns. The logic for handling these cases seems to be incorrect, leading to the bug.

Bug's Cause:
The bug is likely caused by incorrect handling of the input data type (Series or DataFrame with MultiIndex columns), leading to issues in creating the new index for the unstacked result.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the type of the input data and handle the cases of Series and DataFrame with MultiIndex columns separately.
2. Ensure that the creation of the new index is based on the correct logic for unstacking.

Corrected code:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the code remains the same...

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        if isinstance(data, DataFrame) and isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            result = data
            for i in range(len(clocs)):
                val = clocs[i]
                result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
                clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]
            return result
        else:
            dummy = data.copy()
            dummy.index = dummy_index

            unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
            # Rest of the code remains the same...

    # Rest of the code remains the same...

    return unstacked
```

In the corrected code, we have added an additional check for the type of the input data and handling the cases of Series and DataFrame with MultiIndex columns separately. This should address the bug and improve the functionality of the `_unstack_multiple` function.
