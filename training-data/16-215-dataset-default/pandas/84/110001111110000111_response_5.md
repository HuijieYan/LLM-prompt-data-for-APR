The error is caused by the `_get_level_number` function within the `_unstack_multiple` function. The error message indicates that the level 'A' is not found in the list of names. This is causing a KeyError to be raised. The issue is related to the way levels are indexed in a MultiIndex.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the level is correctly identified and handled within the `_unstack_multiple` function.

The corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function is as follows:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    dummy_index = index.droplevel(clocs)
    unstacked = data.unstack(level=dummy_index.names, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

This corrected code should ensure that the unstacking operation is performed correctly, resolving the issue and passing the failing test cases.
