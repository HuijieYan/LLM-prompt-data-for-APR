The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is using the input variable `clocs` without accounting for the possibility that it might be a tuple of multiple levels for a MultiIndex. This is resulting in an error when trying to get the level number.

To fix this issue, we will modify the function to handle both single-level and multi-level inputs for `clocs`. We can achieve this by checking the type of the input and iterating through the levels to retrieve the level numbers.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(clocs)]

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
    # ...

    return unstacked
```

The modified function checks if the input `clocs` is a tuple, and if so, iterates through the levels to get their level numbers. If it's not a tuple, then it retrieves the level number directly. This approach ensures that the function can handle both single-level and multi-level input for `clocs`.

With this modification, the function should now pass the failing test and produce the expected results for the given input parameters.
