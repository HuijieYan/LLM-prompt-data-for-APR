The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function seems to be originating from the `_get_level_number` method, which is not properly handling tuples as level names when looking for the index. This causes the method to raise a ValueError or KeyError because it cannot find the level name 'A' in the list of names.

The potential cause of the bug is that the code assumes the level to be a string, not accounting for the possibility of tuple level names. This causes the method to fail when trying to index the level name.

To fix the bug, the `_get_level_number` method needs to be updated to handle both string and tuple level names. It should first check if the input is a tuple, and if so, use it as a multilevel index. Then, it can retrieve the level number corresponding to the input tuple.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # rest of the code remains unchanged

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):  # checking if clocs is a tuple
        level = index.names.index(clocs)  # using clocs as a multilevel index
    else:
        level = index._get_level_number(clocs)

    # rest of the code remains unchanged
```

By checking if `clocs` is a tuple and handling it accordingly, we address the issue where the `_get_level_number` method doesn't work as expected. This correction should make the function handle both string and tuple level names properly and resolve the issue observed in the failing test.

After making this correction, the function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable values.
