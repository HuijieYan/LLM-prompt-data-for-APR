The bug occurs in the `_unstack_multiple` function, specifically at the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`. The error message indicates a ValueError with the message 'A' is not in list, which is raised in the `_get_level_number` function due to the fact that 'A' is not found in the list of level names.

This bug is caused by the function trying to use a tuple as the level name, which is not supported. The function expects a string as the level name, and the erroneous usage of a tuple is leading to the ValueError.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle the tuple name correctly and extract the correct level name from the tuple. This modification will involve updating the way level names are extracted and used within the function.

Additionally, we need to ensure that the function can run as expected when provided with a tuple as the level name.

Here's the corrected version of the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [
        index._get_level_number(level if isinstance(level, str) else level[1])
        for level in clocs
    ]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # rest of the function remains the same
```

With this correction, the function should be able to handle the tuple names correctly and pass the failing test.
