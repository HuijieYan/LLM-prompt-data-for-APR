The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is designed to handle multi-level indexes, but it fails when trying to unstack a multi-level index with tuple names. The GitHub issue provides an example where unstacking a multi-level index with tuple names results in a KeyError.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the section where it tries to get the level number of each column in the index using `index._get_level_number(i)`. This may not work correctly with tuple names, leading to the KeyError.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the function's inability to handle tuple names in the multi-level index. This is confirmed by the GitHub issue, which provides an example where the function fails to handle tuple names.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the function to handle tuple names in the multi-level index properly. This may involve checking for tuple names and addressing them differently than regular index names.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data
    
    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index.names.index(i) for i in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    ...
```

In this corrected code, when getting the level number of each column in the index, we check if the name is a tuple. If it is a tuple, we handle it differently than regular index names. This modification should address the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
