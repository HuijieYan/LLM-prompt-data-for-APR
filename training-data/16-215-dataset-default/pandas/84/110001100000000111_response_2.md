The buggy function is `_unstack_multiple`, which is used to unstack a multi-index data structure. The function seems to be encountering an error when it tries to identify the level number from the index. This issue is related to a GitHub issue titled "MultiIndexed unstack with tuple names fails with KeyError". The problem is that the function is unable to find the specified level in the multi-index.

The cause of the bug is that the function `_unstack_multiple` is unable to handle multi-index data with tuple names, leading to a KeyError. When `s.unstack(("A", "a"))` is called, it leads to an error in the `_get_level_number` function.

To fix the bug, it would be necessary to modify how the level number is determined from the index to handle multi-index data with tuple names correctly. 

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to update the `_unstack_multiple` function to specifically handle multi-indexes with tuple names and ensure that the level number is correctly identified from the index.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs=(), fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(index, MultiIndex):
        clocs = [index.names.index(i) if i in index.names else i for i in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index.name if i == 0 else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # rest of the code remains the same
    # ...
```

In the corrected code, we have added a conditional check to handle MultiIndex data differently and to correctly identify the level number from the index. With this modification, the function should now be able to handle multi-index data with tuple names and avoid the KeyError issue.
