1. The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is attempting to unstack a DataFrame with a MultiIndex. The error messages indicate that the issue lies with the `index._get_level_number(i)` call within the function. The error message suggests that the level 'A' is not found in the MultiIndex.

2. The `_unstack_multiple` function is attempting to unstack a DataFrame with a MultiIndex by manipulating the index. It uses the `index._get_level_number(i)` method to get the level number for each level in the `clocs` list, which seems to be causing the issue.

3. Cause of the bug:
   (a) The `_get_level_number` method is likely not finding the provided level in the MultiIndex, leading to a KeyError or ValueError.
   (b) The failing test calls the `unstack` method on a MultiIndex DataFrame with a tuple index, which results in the failure.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a) Update the logic in `_unstack_multiple` to correctly handle getting the level numbers or consider using a different approach to unstack the DataFrame.
   (b) Verify that the `level` being passed to `index._get_level_number(i)` is correct.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = pd.Index(range(len(ccodes[0])), name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = pd.MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [ccodes[0]],
            codes=rcodes + [range(len(ccodes[0]))],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, pd.Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = ccodes
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, pd.Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        new_codes.extend(ccodes)

    new_columns = pd.MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, pd.Series):
        unstacked = unstacked.reindex(new_columns, fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = unstacked.reindex(columns=new_columns, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

The corrected code addresses the issues with getting the level numbers and constructs the required dummy index for unstacking. This corrected code should pass the failing test.
