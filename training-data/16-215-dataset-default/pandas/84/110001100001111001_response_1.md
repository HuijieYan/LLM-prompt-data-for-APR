The potential error in the function lies in how it handles multi-level indices and columns, and how it populates the new_columns and new_levels variables. There are discrepancies between the expected and the actual values of these variables, indicating that there may be errors in calculating these values within the function.

The potential cause of the bug could be that the function is not correctly handling the indices and columns when unstacking the DataFrame. This could lead to incorrect reshaping of the data, resulting in discrepancies between the expected and actual values.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle multi-level indices and columns, and accurately calculate the new columns and levels when unstacking the DataFrame.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]

    unstacked = data.unstack(clocs)

    return unstacked
```

This corrected code should handle the unstacking of the DataFrame correctly, resulting in the expected values for the output variables in all the provided test cases.
