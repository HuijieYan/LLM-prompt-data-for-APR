### Bug Cause

The bug is likely caused by a mismatch between the tuple format of the column names in the multi-index and the expected format in the `_get_level_number` method of the `MultiIndex` class, leading to a `KeyError` when attempting to access the level.

### Possible Fix

The issue can be fixed by modifying the `unstack_multiple` function to handle the case where `clocs` contains a tuple of names. This can be done by first checking if `clocs` is a tuple, and if so, extracting the level numbers using the `get_level_number` function for each name in the tuple.

### Corrected Code

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # ... (existing code)

    index = data.index

    cloc_numbers = []
    for c in clocs:
        if isinstance(c, tuple):
            cloc_numbers.extend([index._get_level_number(i) for i in c])
        else:
            cloc_numbers.append(index._get_level_number(c))

    clocs = cloc_numbers

    # ... (remaining code)
```

This modification checks each element in `clocs` and handles the case where it is a tuple by extracting the level numbers for each name in the tuple and appending them to `cloc_numbers`.

The corrected function should now handle the case where `clocs` consists of a tuple of names, resolving the `KeyError` issue and allowing the function to unstack multi-index data with tuple names.

After making this modification, the function should satisfy the expected input/output variable information and pass the failing test scenario. Additionally, it will address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
