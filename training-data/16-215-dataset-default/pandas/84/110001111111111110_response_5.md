The issue in the provided function lies in the ```_unstack_multiple``` function. The function attempts to convert the tuple of multi-index levels, ```clocs```, to a list of level numbers using the ```_get_level_number``` method of the MultiIndex. However, it incorrectly calls the ```_get_level_number``` method with a tuple of level names instead of a single level name.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the code in the ```_unstack_multiple``` function to correctly handle the input ```clocs``` when it's a tuple of level names.

Here's the corrected implementation of the ```_unstack_multiple``` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Convert clocs to a list of level names
    clocs = [clocs] if isinstance(clocs, tuple) else clocs

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    ...
    ...
    ...
```

By making this modification, the function should now correctly handle the case where ```clocs``` is a tuple of level names and properly extract the level numbers from the MultiIndex. This should resolve the issue and fix the failing test cases as well.
