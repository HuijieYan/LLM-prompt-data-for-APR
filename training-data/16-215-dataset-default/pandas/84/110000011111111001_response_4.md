The bug in the function `_unstack_multiple` is due to the incorrect interpretation of the `clocs` parameter when it receives a tuple. Instead of handling the tuple as expected, the function's code interprets it as a single value without considering the inner elements separately.

To fix this bug, the code should be modified to handle the `clocs` parameter appropriately when it's a tuple.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    # Handle the scenario when clocs is a tuple
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = list(clocs)

    clocs = [data.index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    # ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)
```

With this modification, the function has been updated to correctly handle the `clocs` parameter when it's a tuple, ensuring that each element within the tuple is processed appropriately.

This corrected code now satisfies the expected input/output variable information and should pass the failing test.
