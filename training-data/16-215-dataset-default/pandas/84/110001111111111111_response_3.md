The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is failing due to an issue with the `clocs` parameter, which is a tuple of tuples representing the level names to unstack. The function is trying to get the level number of each name but encountering errors when the names are not found.

The issue is arising because the function `_get_level_number` is not able to handle tuple names properly. This is causing the function to throw a KeyError when trying to find the level number.

To fix this bug, the `_get_level_number` function needs to be updated to handle tuple names appropriately. Additionally, the `clocs` parameter needs to be properly processed to extract the level numbers for unstacking.

It's also important to ensure that the corrected function satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided in the failing test cases.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_level_number` function and the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
# Corrected _get_level_number function to handle tuple names
def _get_level_number(self, level) -> int:
    if isinstance(level, tuple):  # Check if the level is a tuple
        level_names = [name for name in level if name in self.names]
        if len(level_names) > 1:  # If there are multiple matching names
            raise ValueError(f"The name {level} occurs multiple times, use a level number")
        if len(level_names) == 0:  # If no matching names are found
            raise KeyError(f"Level {level} not found")
        return self.names.index(level_names[0])
    else:
        count = self.names.count(level)
        if (count > 1) and not is_integer(level):
            raise ValueError(f"The name {level} occurs multiple times, use a level number")
        try:
            return self.names.index(level)
        except ValueError:
            raise KeyError(f"Level {level} not found")


# Corrected _unstack_multiple function
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    index = data.index
    cloc_numbers = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]  # Get the level numbers for unstacking
    unstacked_data = data.unstack(cloc_numbers, fill_value=fill_value)  # Unstack the data using the level numbers
    return unstacked_data
```

With these corrections, the `_unstack_multiple` function should now handle tuple names correctly and successfully unstack the data according to the provided level names. The corrected code should pass the failing test cases and also address the issue reported in the GitHub post.
