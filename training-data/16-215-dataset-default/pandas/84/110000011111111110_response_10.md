The primary issue here is that in the buggy `_unstack_multiple` function, the input `clocs` is being processed incorrectly. This is causing the code to try and find the index of a tuple ('A', 'a') as the level, which is not a valid operation.

To resolve this issue, the `_unstack_multiple` function needs to handle the unstacking of MultiIndex columns more effectively. Specifically, when extracting the level number of each level in `clocs`, the function should account for the fact that `clocs` can be a tuple of level names. 

The fixed function should be able to parse the inputs correctly and perform the unstacking based on the specified levels.

Here's a proposed corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    cloc_numbers = [index._get_level_number(loc) if isinstance(loc, (str, tuple)) else loc for loc in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    # ... rest of the function
```

With this fix, the function should be able to correctly handle the input `clocs` and perform the unstacking operation as intended. This should resolve the issues observed in the failing tests and in the provided sample cases.
