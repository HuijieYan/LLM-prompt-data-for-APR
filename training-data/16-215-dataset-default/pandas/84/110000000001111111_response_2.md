The problem lies in the `_unstack_multiple` function, specifically in the processing of the input `clocs` which is not being handled correctly when provided as a tuple of tuples.

The issue on GitHub describes a similar failure in the `unstack` method. Based on this, the bug seems to be due to inconsistent handling of the input `clocs` when it includes hierarchical column names (tuples).

To fix the bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the input `clocs` when it includes hierarchical column names.

Here's a possible approach for fixing the bug:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if isinstance(clocs[0], tuple):
        clocs = [data.columns.get_loc(c) for c in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [data.columns.get_loc(clocs)]

    # rest of the code remains unchanged
    # ...
```

In this approach, we first check if the first element in `clocs` is a tuple. If it is, we assume that `clocs` contains hierarchical column names and convert each inner tuple into a list of column indexes using `data.columns.get_loc`. If the first element is not a tuple, we assume that `clocs` contains a single column name and convert it to a list of column indexes as well.

The corrected function should now process the input `clocs` correctly, regardless of whether it contains a single column name or multiple hierarchical column names.

With this fix, the corrected function should now provide the expected output for the given test cases and resolve the issue described in the GitHub problem.

Here's the corrected function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if isinstance(clocs[0], tuple):
        clocs = [data.columns.get_loc(c) for c in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [data.columns.get_loc(clocs)]

    # rest of the code remains unchanged
    # ...
```
This corrected function should now handle both single and multiple hierarchical column names correctly.
