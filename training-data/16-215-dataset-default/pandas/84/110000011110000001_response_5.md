The problematic function seems to be related to the unstack operation in the pandas library, specifically when dealing with MultiIndex. The function is used to unstack a multi-index DataFrame, meaning it takes multiple columns and spreads them into new columns. It appears that the error is related to locating the level number within the multi-index, as indicated by the error message.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the block of code where it attempts to get the level number from the index. This is represented by the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`. The error message indicates that it's unable to find the specified level within the index.

The possible cause of the bug is that the function is not handling multi-level index names correctly, leading to an error when trying to locate the level number. This problem arises when the function is dealing with hierarchical columns in the MultiIndex.

To fix the bug, the function could potentially be modified to handle the multi-level index names by identifying the appropriate level number for unstacking. This involves properly handling the hierarchical column names in the MultiIndex.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [clocs]

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

In this corrected version, an additional check is added to see if the 'clocs' variable is a tuple (indicating multi-level names). If so, it handles them accordingly. This change should address the issue and make the function capable of passing the failing test.
