The issue seems to be with the logic for unstacking the dataframe based on the input clocs. The function is not handling the multi-level index columns and the unstacking process in a correct manner, leading to incorrect results.

Instead of trying to directly unstack the DataFrame with the given clocs, it's better to reset the index first and then unstack the DataFrame, ensuring the correct handling of the hierarchical index.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    data_reset = data.reset_index()
    unstacked = data_reset.set_index(clocs).unstack(fill_value=fill_value)
    
    return unstacked
```

This corrected code uses the reset_index method to move the specified levels of the multi-index into columns, and then applies the unstack method.

The corrected function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided for all given test cases.
