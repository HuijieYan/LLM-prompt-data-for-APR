The error seems to be occurring in the `_get_level_number` method in the MultiIndex class. The function `_unstack_multiple` passes a tuple (e.g., ("A", "a")) to the `_get_level_number` method, but it expects string input as it checks for its presence in the list of level names. Due to the tuple input, it's throwing a ValueError and KeyError.

The bug is caused by passing a tuple to the `_get_level_number` method instead of a string, which the method doesn't handle properly.

A possible approach to fix the bug is to modify the function `_unstack_multiple` to extract the string from the tuple before passing it to the `_get_level_number` method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # other code...

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i[1]) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # other code...

    return unstacked
```

By modifying the clocs list comprehension to extract the string from the tuple before passing it to `_get_level_number`, the bug can be fixed and the function should now pass the failing test.
