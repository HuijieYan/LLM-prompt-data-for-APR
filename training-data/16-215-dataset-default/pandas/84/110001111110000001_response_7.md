The buggy function is `_unstack_multiple` from the file `pandas/core/reshape/reshape.py`. It is used to unstack a DataFrame with a MultiIndex. The failing test `test_unstack_tuplename_in_multiindex` and `test_unstack_mixed_type_name_in_multiindex` are both failing with the error message indicating a KeyError and a ValueError. The issue is located in the `_unstack_multiple` function where it tries to extract the level number using the `_get_level_number` method from the index. The error message indicates that it is unable to find the level which causes the function to fail.

The possible approach to fix the bug is to ensure that the correct level is being used when extracting the level number from the index. Also, handling the levels properly should fix the issue. Additionally, the dataframe unstacking logic needs to be handled according to the different scenarios that are present in the failing tests.

Here is the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    if rlocs == []:
        dummy_index = Index(pd.RangeIndex(index.size), name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [pd.RangeIndex(index.size)],
            codes=rcodes + [pd.RangeIndex(index.size)],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        data.index = index.reorder_levels(clocs + rlocs)
        unstacked = data.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value).reorder_levels(clocs, axis=1)
    else:
        data.index = index.reorder_levels(clocs + rlocs)
        unstacked = data.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value).reorder_levels(clocs, axis=1)

    return unstacked
```

This corrected code should now pass the failing test cases.
