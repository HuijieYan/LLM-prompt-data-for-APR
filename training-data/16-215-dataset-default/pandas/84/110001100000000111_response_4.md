The problematic function is `_unstack_multiple` from the file `pandas/core/reshape/reshape.py`. It seems to have issues with dealing with MultiIndexed unstacking, especially when tuple names are used. The GitHub issue also provides details about the problem when using `s.unstack(("A", "a"))`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is when it tries to get the level number for each level in `clocs` using `index._get_level_number(i)`. This operation may fail when dealing with MultiIndexed data and result in a KeyError, as seen in the GitHub issue.

The bug's cause can be attributed to the function's inability to handle MultiIndex data properly, leading to errors when trying to unstack the data.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the function can handle MultiIndexed data properly, including the retrieval of level numbers and unstacking operations.
2. Address the KeyError related to level names not being found in the MultiIndex when unstacking.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function, incorporating the suggested fixes:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Attempt to handle MultiIndexed data appropriately
    if isinstance(index, MultiIndex):
        # Process clocs for MultiIndex
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, (str, tuple)) else i for i in clocs]

        # Rest of the code remains the same
        ...
```

By handling MultiIndexed data appropriately, especially when retrieving level numbers, the corrected function should be able to resolve the issue posted in the GitHub thread.
