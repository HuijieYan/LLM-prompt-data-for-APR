The bug in the function seems to be related to the unstacking process and the creation of new levels and codes for the MultiIndex.

It appears that the function is not correctly handling the unstacking process for MultiIndex with multiple levels. This is causing discrepancies in the expected and actual output variables.

To fix the bug, the unstacking process and the creation of new levels and codes for the MultiIndex need to be revised. 

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Unstacking the DataFrame based on the given clocs
    unstacked = data.unstack(clocs)

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        unstacked.index = unstacked.index.droplevel(0)
    else:
        unstacked.columns = unstacked.columns.droplevel(0)

    return unstacked
```

This corrected function should now correctly handle the unstacking process for MultiIndex with multiple levels, satisfying the expected input/output variable information provided for all the test cases.
