1. The buggy function is part of the pandas library and is related to the issue of unstacking MultiIndexed Series with tuple names failing with a KeyError. The function attempts to unstack a multi-indexed dataframe but encounters an error due to invalid handling of the index levels.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the section where the function attempts to extract the level number of the index in the `clocs` list using `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`. This is where the KeyError is being raised, indicating that the level is not found.

3. (a). The buggy function attempts to unstack a dataframe with a multi-index.
   (b). The GitHub issue reports an error where unstacking a MultiIndexed Series with tuple names results in a KeyError as the level is not found. This aligns with the potential error location within the function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Ensure that the index levels are being correctly extracted and handled, especially when dealing with MultiIndexed Series with tuple names.
   - Take into account the tuple names and ensure proper level extraction and manipulation.
   - Properly handle hierarchical columns in the unstacking process.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Handle hierarchical columns
    if isinstance(data, Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

This corrected code simplifies the unstacking process by directly using the `unstack` method on the input `data` with the specified `clocs` and `fill_value`. This should properly handle the unstacking of a MultiIndexed Series with tuple names and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
