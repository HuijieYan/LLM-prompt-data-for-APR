The cause of the bug seems to be related to the incorrect manipulation of indices and columns when unstacking the data. The function is not properly handling the MultiIndex structure and is producing unexpected results. 

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle the hierarchical columns and indices. This may involve restructuring the code to ensure that the multi-level nature of the indices and columns is properly accounted for, and the unstacking operation is performed correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    # (existing code...)

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)  # Use the unstack method for Series
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)  # Use the unstack method for DataFrame

    return unstacked
```

In this corrected code, the unstacking is performed directly on the data using the appropriate unstack method for Series and DataFrame, which automatically handles the hierarchical nature of the indices and columns.

This corrected code should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
