The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is causing the ValueError and KeyError because it is unable to handle MultiIndexes properly. The function is trying to get the level number using `_get_level_number`, which is not working as intended.

The failing test cases 'test_unstack_tuplename_in_multiindex' and 'test_unstack_mixed_type_name_in_multiindex' are failing due to the same underlying issue - the function is not able to handle MultiIndexes with tuple names properly, leading to ValueError and KeyError.

The GitHub issue titled "MultiIndexed unstack with tuple names fails with KeyError" also aligns with the failing tests and the error message, indicating that the bug is indeed causing issues with unstacking MultiIndexes with tuple names.

To fix the bug, the function `_unstack_multiple` needs to properly handle MultiIndexes, specifically when dealing with tuple names. It should be able to get the level number and unstack the MultiIndex without raising any errors.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # ... rest of the code remains the same
    # [No changes made beyond this point]

    return unstacked
```

With this corrected code, the function should be able to handle MultiIndexes with tuple names properly and should pass the failing tests. It should also resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub post.
