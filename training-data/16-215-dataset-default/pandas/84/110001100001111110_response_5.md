```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    clocs = [data.index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    # rest of the code
```
In the `_unstack_multiple` function, we initialize the `clocs` variable by looping through it, where `i` is an element of `clocs` and assigning `data.index._get_level_number(i)` to it. This will correctly fix indexing issue while trying to unstack for MultiIndex DataFrame.
