The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is trying to unstack a DataFrame with MultiIndex columns. The function tries to unstack the DataFrame by creating a new index and columns, and then setting them on the unstacked result. The issue seems to be with the way it handles the level names and numbers.

The error message indicates that the function is trying to find the index of a level name in the MultiIndex, but it cannot find it, leading to either a ValueError or a KeyError.

The bug is likely caused by the function incorrectly handling the level names and numbers when dealing with MultiIndex columns.

To fix the bug, the function `_unstack_multiple` needs to correctly handle the level names and numbers for MultiIndex columns. It should correctly identify the index of the levels and modify the columns accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, str) else i for i in clocs]

    result = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return result
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle unstacking of a DataFrame with MultiIndex columns and pass the failing test.
