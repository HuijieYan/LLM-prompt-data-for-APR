The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is failing to handle MultiIndex with tuple names when unstacking. The issue arises from the `_get_level_number` method of the MultiIndex, which is not able to handle tuple names properly.

The error occurs when the `unstack` operation is performed on a MultiIndex with tuple names. When the function `_unstack_multiple` attempts to convert the level names to level numbers using the `_get_level_number` method, it raises a `ValueError` and then a `KeyError` because it is not able to handle tuple names properly.

The incorrect variable information in the failing test cases is due to the buggy behavior of the function. The actual value and type of the variables point to discrepancies in the function's behavior, which lead to the failing test and the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the `_get_level_number` method needs to be updated to handle tuple names properly. It should be able to discern the tuple names and convert them to the correct level numbers.

Here is the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

With this correction, the `_get_level_number` method will properly handle tuple names and convert them to the correct level numbers. This change should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
