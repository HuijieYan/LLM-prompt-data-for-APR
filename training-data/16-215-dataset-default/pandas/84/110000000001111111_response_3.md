The bug appears to be caused by the faulty _unstack_multiple function due to discrepancies between its expected and actual input/output variable values. The function does not handle hierarchical columns correctly, leading to the KeyError during unstacking with tuple names.

To fix the bug, the _unstack_multiple function needs to be updated to handle hierarchical columns correctly. The function should correctly handle the input parameters and perform the unstacking operation with tuple names.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):  # handle hierarchical columns
        clocs = tuple(index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number((i,)) for i in clocs)
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

This corrects the handling of hierarchical columns and resolves the issue with unstacking with tuple names. The function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub issue.
