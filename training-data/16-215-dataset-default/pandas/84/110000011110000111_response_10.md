## 1. Analysis
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is intended to perform an unstack operation on a DataFrame or Series with a MultiIndex. However, it fails to handle the case when the level names are tuples, which causes the KeyError and ValueError.

The failing test functions are meant to test the unstack operation for MultiIndex with tuple names.

The GitHub issue reports that unstacking a Series with MultiIndex tuple names fails with a KeyError.

## 2. Potential Error Location
The issue likely lies in the `_unstack_multiple` function's implementation of handling MultiIndex with tuple names.

## 3. Bug Cause
The buggy function does not handle the case when the MultiIndex has tuple names properly, leading to the KeyError and ValueError reported in the failing tests and the GitHub issue.

## 4. Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug
A possible approach to fixing the bug is to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to properly handle MultiIndex with tuple names. This could involve identifying the level numbers correctly when tuple names are present and appropriately unstacking the DataFrame or Series.

## 5. Corrected Code

Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function that should resolve the issue:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(index, MultiIndex):
        levels = [index.get_level_values(i) for i in range(index.nlevels)]
        level_names = index.names

        new_clocs = []
        for cloc in clocs:
            if isinstance(cloc, tuple):
                cloc = tuple(index.names.index(name) if isinstance(name, tuple) else name for name in cloc)
                new_clocs.append(cloc)
            else:
                new_clocs.append(index.names.index(cloc))

        result = data

        for cloc in new_clocs:
            result = result.unstack(cloc, fill_value=fill_value)

        # Recreate the MultiIndex with proper names
        new_levels = [levels[cloc] for cloc in new_clocs]
        new_level_names = [level_names[cloc] if isinstance(clocs[cloc], tuple) else None for cloc in new_clocs]

        new_index = MultiIndex.from_arrays(new_levels, names=new_level_names)

        if isinstance(data, Series):
            result.index = new_index
        else:
            result.columns = new_index

        return result
    else:
        return data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
```

This correction checks for whether the index is a MultiIndex and appropriately handles the unstack operation based on the type of level names present. This corrected function should address the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
