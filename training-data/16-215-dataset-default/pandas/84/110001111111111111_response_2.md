The issue in the buggy function `_unstack_multiple` lies in the way it handles multi-index unstacking. The error is caused by the `_get_level_number` function, which fails to handle tuple names properly. This leads to a `KeyError` when trying to unstack a multi-index with tuple names.

To fix this issue, the `_get_level_number` function should be modified to handle tuple names correctly.

Potential approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `_get_level_number` function to handle tuple names appropriately.
2. Ensure that the modified function can handle both single-level and multi-level indexing correctly.
3. Update the `_unstack_multiple` function to utilize the modified `_get_level_number` function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Other code remains unchanged ...

    # Modify the _get_level_number function to handle tuple names
    def _get_level_number(self, level):
        if isinstance(level, tuple):
            pos = self.names.index(level)
        elif not is_integer(level):
            count = self.names.count(level)
            if count > 1:
                raise ValueError(f"The name {level} occurs multiple times, use a level number")
            pos = self.names.index(level)
        else:
            pos = level
        return pos

    # Attach the modified _get_level_number function to the MultiIndex class
    MultiIndex._get_level_number = _get_level_number

    # The rest of the function remains unchanged ...
```

This corrected function should now handle tuple names in multi-index unstacking correctly and pass the failing test. It should also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub ticket.
