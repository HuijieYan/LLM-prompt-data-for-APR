The buggy function is `_unstack_multiple` in the file `pandas/core/reshape/reshape.py`. This function is responsible for unstacking a DataFrame or Series with a MultiIndex.

The error occurs when trying to retrieve the level number for a tuple name in a MultiIndex, which results in a KeyError. This is evident from the error message provided by the failing test.

The failing test is trying to unstack a DataFrame with a MultiIndex using a tuple name, which triggers the error.

The GitHub issue describes the same problem - unstacking a MultiIndex with tuple names fails with a KeyError.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle the case where the level passed to `_get_level_number` is a tuple name in the MultiIndex. The function should be able to correctly retrieve the level number in this scenario.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to check if the level is a tuple, and then handle it differently by searching for the tuple name in the MultiIndex.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    if all(isinstance(level, tuple) for level in clocs):
        cloc_numbers = [index.names.index(level) for level in clocs]
    else:
        cloc_numbers = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in cloc_numbers]

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With this correction, the function should now be able to handle unstacking a MultiIndex with tuple names and pass the failing test. Additionally, it should resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
