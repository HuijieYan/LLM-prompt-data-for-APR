The bug in the function `_unstack_multiple` is that it doesn't properly handle the case when a tuple of names is passed as the `clocs` parameter. It tries to call the private method `_get_level_number` with a tuple as an argument, which leads to a `ValueError` when the tuple is not found in the list of names.

To fix this bug, the function needs to handle the case when a tuple of names is passed as the `clocs` parameter and appropriately convert them to the corresponding level numbers before proceeding with the rest of the unstacking process.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        level_numbers = [index._get_level_number(name) for name in clocs]
    else:
        level_numbers = [index._get_level_number(clocs)]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in level_numbers]

    # ... rest of the code remains unchanged
```

By handling the case when a tuple of names is passed as the `clocs` parameter and converting them to level numbers, the function should now work correctly and pass the failing test cases.

With the corrected code, the function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided and pass the failing test.
