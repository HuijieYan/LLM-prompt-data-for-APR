The bug in the function seems to be related to the unstacking process and the re-arranging of the index and columns. The discrepancies between the expected and actual output variable values indicate that the unstacking process is not working correctly, leading to incorrect reshaping of the data.

The potential error location within the function is likely in the unstacking process, where the index and columns are being transformed. It seems that the unstacking logic and the arrangement of new levels, names, and codes are not aligning with the expected output.

To fix the bug, the unstacking process and the rearrangement of the index and columns need to be revised. Specifically, the logic for restructuring the index, columns, levels, names, and codes needs to be reviewed and corrected to ensure that the reshaping of the data aligns with the expected output.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Perform unstacking based on the provided clocs
    unstacked = data.unstack(clocs)

    return unstacked
```

This revised function should properly handle the unstacking process based on the provided clocs, resulting in a reshaped output that aligns with the expected input/output variable information provided.
