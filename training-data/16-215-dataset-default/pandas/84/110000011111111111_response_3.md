The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is failing to handle the case where the `clocs` input parameter is a tuple of strings representing level names in the `MultiIndex`. This is causing an error when trying to get the level number using the `_get_level_number` method.

The failing test is attempting to unstack the DataFrame using a tuple of string level names (e.g., `("A", "a")`), leading to the KeyError due to the function not being able to understand the level names.

The expected input/output variable information provided by the failing test does not match the actual variable values at the function's return, indicating that the function is not handling the unstacking operation correctly.

The GitHub issue raised for this bug provides a clear example of the problem and the corresponding error message.

To fix the bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function needs to be modified to handle the case where the `clocs` input parameter is a tuple of strings representing level names in the `MultiIndex`. This can be achieved by checking the type of the input and converting the strings to corresponding level numbers using the `get_loc_level` method if necessary.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data
    
    index = data.index
    
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [index.get_loc_level(name) for name in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With this correction, the function should be able to handle the unstacking operation with a tuple of string level names as input and satisfy the failing test as well as the expected input/output variable information provided. This should also address the issue raised in the GitHub problem statement.
