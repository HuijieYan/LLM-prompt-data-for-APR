The bug is occurring when the `unstack` function is called with a tuple of names as the level to unstack. The bug happens because the `clocs` variable is not being correctly handled within the `_unstack_multiple` function.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the code that handles the `clocs` variable. The `clocs` variable is expected to be a tuple of names, and the function is treating it as a list of integers. This is causing the KeyError when trying to access the level names.

To fix the bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function needs to correctly handle the `clocs` variable as a tuple of names, get the level numbers, and use them to perform the unstack operation.

Here is the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function that resolves the issue:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    if not isinstance(clocs, (list, tuple)):
        clocs = [clocs]

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # rest of the code remains unchanged
    # ...
```

This corrected code handles the `clocs` variable as a tuple of names, gets the level numbers using the `_get_level_number` method, and then proceeds with the unstacking operation.

With the corrected code, the function should now successfully unstack the DataFrame without encountering a KeyError, and it should satisfy the input/output variable information provided. This should also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
