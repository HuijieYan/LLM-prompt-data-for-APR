The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is failing because it is unable to correctly handle the tuple names in the MultiIndex. This is leading to a `KeyError` and `ValueError`.

The issue seems to be in the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`. It appears that the function `_get_level_number` is unable to correctly handle tuple names in the MultiIndex.

It's likely that the issue lies in how the function handles the tuple names in the MultiIndex. This seems to be leading to a misinterpretation of the level, causing the errors.

To fix this bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function needs to be modified to handle tuple names properly and ensure that the `level` is correctly interpreted. This may involve changes to how the tuple names are processed within the function.

The corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function is provided below:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Handle tuple names in MultiIndex
    if isinstance(clocs[0], tuple):
        clocs = [
            index._get_level_number(name)
            if isinstance(name, tuple)
            else name
            for name in clocs
        ]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    [...]
```

With this correction, the function should be able to correctly handle tuple names within the MultiIndex and avoid the KeyError and ValueError. This updated function should also pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
