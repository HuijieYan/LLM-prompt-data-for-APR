The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is likely in the section where it retrieves the level number using the `_get_level_number` function. The error message indicates that the level "A" is not found, which suggests that there is a problem with the way the function is accessing level information.

The potential cause of the bug could be that the function `_get_level_number` is not handling the MultiIndex with tuples correctly. It is likely not interpreting the tuples as expected.

To fix the bug, one approach could be to ensure that the `_get_level_number` function can handle MultiIndex with tuples properly. This might involve modifying the way levels are accessed and checked within the function.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

In the corrected code, a check is added to handle tuples correctly in `_get_level_number`, ensuring that level number is retrieved properly for MultiIndex with tuples. This should address the issue raised in the failing tests.
