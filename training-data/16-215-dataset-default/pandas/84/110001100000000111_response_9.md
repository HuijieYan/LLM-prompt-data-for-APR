The bug in the function `_unstack_multiple` is causing a KeyError during the execution of the `s.unstack(("A", "a"))` in the GitHub issue. The error is occurring because the function is trying to access a level 'A' which is not found in the MultiIndex.

This bug is likely caused by the function's handling of clocs and rlocs lists, which represent the column and row locations of the index. The function then attempts to access these levels using the `_get_level_number` method, which is causing the KeyError when the desired level is not found.

To fix the bug in the function, we need to ensure that the clocs and rlocs lists are correctly populated and that the levels being accessed from the index are valid.

One possible approach to fix this bug is to carefully iterate through the clocs and rlocs lists while ensuring that the levels being accessed from the index are valid. Additionally, proper error handling should be implemented to handle cases where the levels do not exist in the index.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if i in index.names else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

In the corrected code, we check if the level exists in the index names before trying to access it, and only then use the `_get_level_number` method. This will prevent the KeyError if the desired level is not found.
