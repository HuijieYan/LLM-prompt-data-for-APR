1. The buggy function is related to a GitHub issue where unstacking a MultiIndex with tuple names results in a KeyError. The issue is caused by an error in the `_unstack_multiple` function, which doesn't handle hierarchical columns correctly. This is causing the function to raise a KeyError when trying to get the level number of the tuple names.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is at the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`, where the function tries to get the level number of the column locations.

3. The bug is caused by the function not handling hierarchical columns correctly, resulting in a KeyError when trying to get the level number of tuple names. This is in line with the error message "KeyError: 'Level A not found'".

4. To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle hierarchical columns and MultiIndex with tuple names. One approach could be to modify the function to handle MultiIndex columns and tuple names explicitly, ensuring that the level numbers are correctly retrieved. Additionally, the function should handle unstacking MultiIndex columns with tuple names in a way that avoids raising a KeyError.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function that resolves the issue posted in GitHub:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data
    
    if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
        unstacked_data = data.unstack(clocs)
    else:
        unstacked_data = data.unstack(fill_value)
    
    return unstacked_data
```

This corrected code handles MultiIndex columns and tuple names appropriately and should resolve the KeyError issue when unstacking a MultiIndex with tuple names.
