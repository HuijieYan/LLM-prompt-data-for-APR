The problem with the `astype_nansafe` function seems to be its inability to handle NaN values when casting to integer types, especially when dealing with datetimes or timedeltas. This is evident from the failing test function, which raises a ValueError when trying to cast a NaN value to an integer.

The GitHub issue "Converting from categorical to int ignores NaNs" also highlights a similar problem with converting categorical values to integers, where NaN is being incorrectly converted to a large negative integer.

The potential error location within the `astype_nansafe` function seems to be the handling of NaN values when converting to integer types, especially in the `is_datetime64_dtype` and `is_timedelta64_dtype` blocks.

To fix this issue, the function needs to handle NaN values appropriately when casting to integer types. It should check for NaN values and convert them to NaN or appropriate integer value depending on the context, rather than raising an error or converting them to unexpected large negative integers.

Here is the corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    if isinstance(dtype, pd.CategoricalDtype):
        return arr.astype(dtype)

    if np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer) and np.nan in arr:
        result = arr.copy()
        result[np.isnan(arr)] = pd.NA
        return result.astype(dtype)

    return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)
```

This corrected function checks if the dtype is a categorical type and converts the array appropriately. It also handles the case where the array contains NaN values and correctly converts them to NaN or integer based on the dtype. This should address the issue raised in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
