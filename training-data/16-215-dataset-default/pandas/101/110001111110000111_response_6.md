Analysis:
The buggy function astype_nansafe is designed to cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. The failing test is trying to convert a NaN value to an integer and is expecting a ValueError to be raised, but the function is not raising the expected error.

Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to be caused by the mishandling of NaN values when casting to specific data types, such as integer from datetime or timedelta.

Potential Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Handle NaN values appropriately when casting to integer data types.
2. Ensure that the function raises the correct error when encountering an NaN value that cannot be converted to the specified data type.

Corrected Code for the Problematic Function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # Existing code...

    if np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.datetime64) or np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.timedelta64):
        if pd.isna(arr).any():
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaN values to an integer dtype")

    # Existing code...
```

This corrected code checks for the presence of NaN values in the array before attempting to cast to integer data types, and raises a ValueError if NaN values are encountered.

Once this corrected code is implemented, it should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub thread regarding the incorrect conversion of NaN values to integer when casting from a categorical data type.
