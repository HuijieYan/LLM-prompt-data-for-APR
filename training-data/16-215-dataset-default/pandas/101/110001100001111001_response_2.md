Potential Error Location:
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of the dtype parameter within the function. It appears that the function is not properly handling the dtype parameter when it is of type datetime64 or timedelta64, leading to incorrect dtype assignments.

Bug's Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the mishandling of the dtype parameter within the function, particularly when it is of type datetime64 or timedelta64. The function is not properly converting these data types to the expected int64 dtype.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Add proper handling for datetime64 and timedelta64 data types to ensure they are converted to the expected int64 dtype.
2. Ensure that the dtype parameter is correctly identified and processed for datetime64 and timedelta64 data types.
3. Perform type checking and conversion as necessary to handle datetime64 and timedelta64 data types correctly.

Corrected Code:
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    if is_datetime64_dtype(arr) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        dtype = np.int64
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(arr) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        dtype = np.int64
        
    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
    # ...
```

By adding proper handling for datetime64 and timedelta64 data types, the corrected code ensures that the dtype parameter is correctly identified and processed, satisfying the expected input/output variable information provided.
