The original function provided has several issues and is difficult to exactly ascertain the specific problem without more context surrounding the error. Therefore, the version of the function was corrected based on the issues described. However, it's still recommended to thoroughly test the new version to ensure it performs as expected. Here's a corrected version of the function based on the issues described:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# This is the corrected version of the function
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray
        The array with elements cast to the specified dtype.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    if not isinstance(dtype, pd.api.types.CategoricalDtype):
        return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)

    codes = pd.array([], dtype=np.int8)
    if len(arr.categories) == 0:
        codes = codes.astype(np.int16)

    codes = pd.array(arr, dtype=dtype.code_dtype)
    return codes.astype(dtype.code_dtype)

# Example usage
s = pd.Series([1, 0, None], dtype='category')
print(s)
print(s.astype(int))
```

Please note that this corrected version addresses the specific issue related to casting from a categorical series back into an `int` column as described in the GitHub issue. This fix is based on the assumption that the issue relates to the conversion of categorical series with NaN values to integer, as described in the provided GitHub issue descriptions. If there are further issues or variations to the problem, additional details may be required for a more precise fix.
