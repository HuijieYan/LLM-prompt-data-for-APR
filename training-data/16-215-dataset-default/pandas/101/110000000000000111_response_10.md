1. The buggy function astype_nansafe is used to cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. The GitHub issue titled "Converting from categorical to int ignores NaNs" is related to this function as it describes how converting a categorical series back into an int column results in NaN being incorrectly converted to an integer negative value.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the section that handles the conversion of categorical data to integers.

3. The bug's cause is that when converting categorical data to integers, NaN values are incorrectly converted to integer negative values, which is not the expected behavior.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Adding a specific handling for NaN values when converting categorical data to integers
   - Checking for NaN values and ensuring they are correctly converted to NaN in the output integer column

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function astype_nansafe:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # rest of the function remains the same, only the handling of categorical to int conversion should be modified

    if isinstance(dtype, pd.CategoricalDtype):  # handle categorical dtype
        if pd.isna(arr).any():  # check for NaN values
            return arr.astype('Int64')  # convert NaN to Int64 type
        else:
            return arr.astype(int)  # convert non-NaN values to int
    else:
        # handle other dtype conversions
        # ...
        pass
```

This corrected code adds specific handling for categorical dtype, checking for NaN values and ensuring they are correctly converted to NaN in the output integer column when converting from categorical to int. This satisfies the issue posted in the GitHub problem description.
