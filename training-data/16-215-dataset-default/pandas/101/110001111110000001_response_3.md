The buggy function is the "astype_nansafe" in the "pandas/core/dtypes/cast.py" file, which is called by the failing test "test_astype_nansafe" in the "pandas/tests/dtypes/test_common.py" file.

The failing test is checking for the conversion of 'NaT' (Not a Time) values to an integer. The error message indicates that the ValueError is not being raised as expected, which means the function is not handling 'NaT' values correctly.

The potential error location within the "astype_nansafe" function is the block that handles datetime64 and timedelta64 types. It seems that the function is not properly handling the conversion of 'NaT' values to integers.

The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of 'NaT' values when converting to integer types.

To fix the bug, the "astype_nansafe" function needs to handle 'NaT' values appropriately when converting to integer types. This can be achieved by adding a condition to check for 'NaT' values and raising a ValueError as required.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
        Cannot convert NaT values to integer.
    """

    if np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer) and np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.datetime64) and np.isnat(arr).any():
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # rest of the function remains the same as the original
```

This corrected function includes a check for 'NaT' values when converting to integer types, and it raises a ValueError in that case. With this correction, the function should pass the failing test and handle 'NaT' values correctly.
