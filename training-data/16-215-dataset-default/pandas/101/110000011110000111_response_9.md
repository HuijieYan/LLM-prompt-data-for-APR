The issue in the buggy function is related to converting categorical data with NaN values to an integer dtype. This is causing unexpected behavior and error messages in the failing test. The GitHub issue provides a specific example of this problem and describes the expected behavior.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the section that handles converting categorical data to an integer. The function is not handling NaN values correctly, leading to the error.

The cause of the bug is that NaN values in categorical data are not being properly handled when converting to an integer type. This results in unexpected behavior and error messages, as described in the failing test and the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the function needs to check for NaN values in categorical data and handle them appropriately when converting to an integer type. This will ensure that the function behaves as expected and passes the failing test.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    if is_extension_array_dtype(dtype):
        return dtype.construct_array_type()._from_sequence(arr, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)

    if not isinstance(dtype, np.dtype):
        dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)

    if issubclass(dtype.type, str):
        return lib.astype_str(arr.ravel(), skipna=skipna).reshape(arr.shape)

    # handle categorical data with NaN values
    if is_categorical_dtype(arr) and pd.isna(arr).any():
        if np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer) or np.issubdtype(dtype, np.floating):
            return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)

    # rest of the function remains the same

    # ...
    # (remaining code unchanged)
    # ...
```

In the corrected version, we added a check for categorical data with NaN values and handle the conversion appropriately. This should fix the issue described in the failing test and the GitHub problem description.
