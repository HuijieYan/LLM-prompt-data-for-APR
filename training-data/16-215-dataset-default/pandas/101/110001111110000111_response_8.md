The buggy function `astype_nansafe` seems to be designed to cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. It handles various cases based on the dtype of the array and the desired dtype, including handling datetime and timedelta dtypes, as well as converting non-finite values to integers.

The failing test `test_astype_nansafe` is checking the behavior of the function when casting `NaT` values to an integer dtype, and it is currently failing to raise a `ValueError` as expected.

The GitHub issue describes a similar problem where converting categorical series back into an integer column incorrectly converts NaN to an unexpected negative integer value.

The potential error location within the problematic function could be the handling of NaN values when casting to specific dtypes, such as integer.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include handling the conversion of NaN values for specific dtypes more explicitly, and ensuring that the function raises appropriate errors when necessary.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `astype_nansafe`:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # rest of the function remains the same
    # ...

    # An additional condition to handle NaN values when casting to integer
    if np.isnan(arr).any() and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaN values to integer")

    return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)
```

With this corrected code, the function should now pass the failing test and correctly handle the conversion of NaN values to an integer dtype. The fix also aligns with the issue reported on GitHub regarding categorical series conversion.
