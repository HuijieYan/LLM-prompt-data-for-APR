The bug in the function `astype_nansafe` is that it does not handle the case when the input array `arr` contains NaT (Not a Time) values and it is being cast to an integer type. The function does not raise a ValueError as expected when trying to convert NaT values to integer.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to specifically handle the case when the input array contains NaT values and is being cast to an integer type.

Here's the corrected code for the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas.testing as tm
import pytest


def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
        Cannot convert NaT values to integer.

    """

    # Original implementation of the function

    if arr.dtype == np.datetime64('NaT'):
        if dtype == np.int64:
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # rest of the function remains the same


# The relative path of the failing test file: pandas/tests/dtypes/test_common.py

@pytest.mark.parametrize("val", [np.datetime64("NaT"), np.timedelta64("NaT")])
@pytest.mark.parametrize("typ", [np.int64])
def test_astype_nansafe(val, typ):
    arr = np.array([val])

    msg = "Cannot convert NaT values to integer"
    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match=msg):
        astype_nansafe(arr, dtype=typ)
```

With this correction, the `astype_nansafe` function checks if the input array `arr` contains NaT values, and if it does and is being cast to an integer type, it raises a ValueError as expected.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
