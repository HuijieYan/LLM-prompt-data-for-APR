The buggy function `astype_nansafe` is designed to cast elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. The failing test is testing the function with a `NaT` (Not a Time) value and expecting a `ValueError` to be raised, but the function is not raising the expected error.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the block related to datetime and timedelta dtypes. Specifically, the issue arises when attempting to cast a datetime or timedelta with NaN values to an integer dtype, which is not handled correctly.

The bug is caused by the function not properly handling the conversion of NaN values to integer dtype when dealing with datetime or timedelta arrays.

To fix the bug, the function should check for NaN values and raise a `ValueError` if the conversion to integer dtype is not possible due to the presence of NaN.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    if np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer) and np.isnan(arr).any():  # Check for NaN values when casting to integer dtype
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaN values to integer")
    
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    
    # ... (rest of the function code)
```

This corrected code modifies the `astype_nansafe` function to explicitly check for NaN values when casting to an integer dtype. It raises a `ValueError` if NaN values are present, which addresses the issue reported in the failing test and GitHub issue. This correction ensures that the function properly handles the casting of datetime and timedelta arrays with NaN values to integer dtype.

By implementing this change, the updated `astype_nansafe` function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
