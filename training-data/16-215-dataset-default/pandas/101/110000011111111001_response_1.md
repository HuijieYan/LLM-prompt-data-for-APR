The buggy function `astype_nansafe` is failing because it is not handling the conversion of NaT values to integer types correctly. The failing test is expecting a ValueError to be raised when trying to convert NaT values to integer, but the function is not raising this error.

The bug is likely located in the section of code where the function is trying to handle datetime and timedelta arrays being converted to integer types.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to correctly handle the conversion of NaT values to integer types. We should check if the input array contains NaT values and raise a ValueError if it does, as the current behavior is not consistent with the failing test's expectations.

Here's the corrected code for the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    if arr.dtype == dtype and not copy:
        return arr

    if issubclass(dtype.type, str):
        return arr.astype(dtype)

    if np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.datetime64) or np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.timedelta64):
        if np.isnat(arr).any():
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)
```

With this corrected code, the function now correctly handles the conversion of NaT values to integer types and should pass the failing test. It also satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided.
