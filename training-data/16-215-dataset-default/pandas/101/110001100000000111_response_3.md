1. The buggy function `astype_nansafe` is responsible for casting elements of an array to a given data type in a nan-safe manner. It converts categorical series back into an integer column, but it converts NaN to incorrect integer negative values. The related function `astype_nansafe` in the same file (`pandas/core/dtypes/cast.py`) is called by the buggy function to perform the actual type casting.

The GitHub issue titled "Converting from categorical to int ignores NaNs" provides details of the problem, stating that when converting a categorical series containing NaNs to an integer dtype, NaNs are incorrectly converted to negative integer values.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function `astype_nansafe` is identified in the section where it handles the conversion of categorical series to integer. This is seen in the line `elif np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.floating) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer)`.

3. The bug's cause can be identified as follows:
   (a). The problematic function is not handling the conversion of categorical series containing NaNs to integer dtype correctly.
   (b). It attempts to convert floating NaNs to integers without proper handling, leading to unexpected results.
   (c). The GitHub issue provides a clear example of the problem where converting a categorical series with NaNs to an integer dtype produces incorrect negative integer values for NaNs.

4. Potential approaches for fixing the bug include:
   (a). Updating the code in the section that handles the conversion of categorical series to integer dtype to properly handle NaN values.
   (b). Adding a check for NaN values before converting to integer dtype and treating NaNs appropriately.
   (c). Ensuring that the conversion from categorical to integer dtype handles NaNs in a way that aligns with the expected behavior.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `astype_nansafe`:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)

    if is_categorical_dtype(arr) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        if isna(arr).any():
            return arr.astype('Int64')  # treat NaN as an integer missing value
        else:
            return arr.astype(dtype)  # convert categorical to integer as-is

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)

    return arr.view(dtype)
```

In the corrected code, a specific check is added for categorical dtype and the conversion to integer dtype. If NaN values are present in the categorical series, they are properly handled by converting to `Int64` to treat NaN as a missing value. If no NaNs are present, the categorical series is converted to the specified integer dtype. This update addresses the issue raised in the GitHub bug report.
