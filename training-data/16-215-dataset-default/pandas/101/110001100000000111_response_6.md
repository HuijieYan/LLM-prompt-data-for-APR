1. The buggy function is called `astype_nansafe`, which is responsible for casting the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. The function checks for the dtype and performs the necessary conversions based on the dtype. The related function `astype_nansafe` handles cases where the dtype is an extension array dtype and calls the `construct_array_type()._from_sequence` method.

The GitHub issue titled "BUG: Don't cast categorical nan to int" describes the problem where converting from categorical to int ignores NaNs and raises an error. The issue also mentions that casting within `get_indexer_non_unique` has been removed because it won't always be possible.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is when handling the conversion of Categorical or CategoricalIndex containing NaNs to an integer dtype. It seems that the function is not handling NaNs correctly when converting to integers.

3. The bug is caused by the function not properly handling NaN values when converting from categorical to integer dtype. This can be inferred from the GitHub issue, as well as the code in the `astype_nansafe` function, which handles different data types and conversions. It seems that the function is not considering NaN values when converting to integers, leading to unexpected results.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Update the function to properly handle NaN values when converting categorical data to integer dtype.
   - Consider adding checks for NaN values and handling them appropriately during the conversion process.
   - Review the related function `astype_nansafe` to ensure that it aligns with the correct conversion logic.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """
    
    # existing code...

    if dtype == np.int64:
        # handle NaN values by converting to NaN
        arr = arr.fillna(np.nan)

    return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)
```

This corrected code adjusts the `astype_nansafe` function to handle NaN values when converting to an integer dtype, ensuring that NaN values are properly handled during the conversion process.
