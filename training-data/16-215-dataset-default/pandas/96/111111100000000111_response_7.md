The buggy function is part of the BusinessHourMixin class in the offsets.py file of the pandas library. It is being used to calculate the next business day considering business hours and holidays. The related functions in the same file and class are used for various business day and business hour calculations.

The GitHub issue indicates that when using the date_range function with periods and adding holidays, the output is not as expected. It produces more than the specified number of periods and includes dates that are affected by the added holidays.

The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the logic related to adjusting the business days and business hours, especially when dealing with holidays.

The bug's cause is likely due to the incorrect handling of holidays within the apply function. It seems that the function is not adjusting for holidays properly, leading to unexpected results in the date range output.

To fix the bug, the apply function should be modified to properly account for holidays when calculating the next business day. This may involve adjusting the logic related to business days and business hours to correctly skip over holidays and produce the expected output.

Here's the corrected code for the apply function that addresses the bug and resolves the issue posted in GitHub:

```python
# Import necessary package
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour

# This is the corrected version of the apply function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Adjusted logic to properly account for holidays
            cbh = CustomBusinessHour(start=self.start, end=self.end, holidays=self.holidays)
            return cbh.rollforward(other)
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, the apply function creates a CustomBusinessHour object with the specified start, end, and holidays before using the rollforward method to calculate the next business day, accounting for holidays as well. This should resolve the issue and produce the expected output for the date range function.
