The buggy function is called `apply` and it is a part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the file `pandas/tseries/offsets.py`. It takes an argument `other` which is expected to be of type `datetime`. The function attempts to perform some calculations and adjustments based on the input `other`.

The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` utilizes the `apply` function through the `pd.date_range` method with a `CustomBusinessHour` frequency, and it checks if the result matches the expected output. The error message indicates that there is a problem with the inferred frequency not conforming to the passed frequency.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the calculation and adjustments made based on the input `other`. There could be an issue with how the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency is being handled within the function.

The bug is likely caused due to incorrect handling of the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency within the `apply` function, which leads to the inferred frequency not conforming to the passed frequency, resulting in the ValueError.

To fix the bug, the handling of the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency within the `apply` function needs to be corrected. This could involve ensuring that the adjustments and calculations are made in accordance with the specified frequency.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    from pandas import Timestamp, Timedelta

    if isinstance(other, Timestamp):
        n = self.n
        result = other + n * Timedelta(hours=1)

        if n >= 0:
            while not self._is_on_offset(result) or result.time() not in self.end:
                result += Timedelta(hours=1)
        else:
            while not self._is_on_offset(result) or result.time() not in self.start:
                result += Timedelta(hours=1)

        return result
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, the calculation and adjustments are made based on the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency. The `other` input and the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency are properly handled to ensure that the adjustments conform to the specified frequency.
