1. The buggy function `apply` is a method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which is related to the GitHub issue as it seems to be related to handling business hours and holidays. The function is used to adjust a given datetime based on business hours and the `n` parameter.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be where it checks for the edge condition and adjusts the given datetime based on business hours and holidays.

3. The bug's cause could be related to how the function handles the adjustment of the datetime based on business days (`BusinessDay`), the calculation of total business hours, and the application of business hours to the given datetime. The GitHub issue further suggests that this problem arises when using the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency with holidays.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include verifying the correctness of the adjustment logic, ensuring that the calculation of business hours and the application of business hours to the datetime are accurate, and considering the impact of holidays on the adjustment.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour
import pandas as pd

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # other methods remain the same

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, pd.Timestamp):
            custom_bh = CustomBusinessHour(start=self.start, end=self.end, holidays=self.holidays)
            return custom_bh.apply(other)
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected code, the function `apply` uses `CustomBusinessHour` from `pandas.tseries.offsets` to apply the business hours with consideration of holidays to the given timestamp. This approach should address the issue mentioned in the GitHub problem description.
