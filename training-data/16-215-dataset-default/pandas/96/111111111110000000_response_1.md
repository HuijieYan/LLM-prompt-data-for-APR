The code provided contains a buggy function `apply` that has several issues. The main issues are due to the use of unassigned variables and incorrect method calls. Below is the corrected version:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import pandas as pd
import pandas.tseries.offsets as offsets

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class BusinessHourMixin:
    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    @staticmethod
    def apply_wraps(func):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
        pass

    def __init__(self, start, end):
        self.start = start
        self.end = end

    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = offsets.BusinessDay(n=bd)

                if not self.next_bday(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0) != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ValueError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version makes use of the methods and attributes of the class, avoids using undefined variables, and fixes some method calls that were incorrect. The corrected function is now more consistent and should work as intended.
