Problem Analysis:
1. The buggy function is meant to adjust a datetime object based on a set of business hours, but it seems to be creating unexpected results when holidays are introduced. The GitHub issue also points to a similar problem when using periods and adding holidays to a date range.
2. The potential error location is likely within the logic that handles the adjustment of the datetime object to account for business hours and holidays.

Bug Cause:
The buggy function's adjustment logic does not properly handle holidays, leading to unexpected results when trying to calculate the datetime based on business hours and holidays. This aligns with the GitHub issue where adding holidays results in more than the specified number of periods in the date range.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the logic for handling holidays within the adjustment process and ensure that it correctly accounts for holidays when determining the adjusted datetime.
2. Verify that the adjustment logic properly considers both business hours and holidays when making adjustments to the datetime object.

Corrected Code:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BDay
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# this is the corrected function
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # handle holidays
        holidays = self.holidays if hasattr(self, "holidays") else None
        
        # use CustomBusinessHour with holidays to account for business hours and holidays
        cbh = CustomBusinessHour(start=self.start, end=self.end, holidays=holidays)
        
        # adjust the datetime using CustomBusinessHour
        adjusted_datetime = cbh.apply(other)
        
        return adjusted_datetime
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected function uses the `CustomBusinessHour` from pandas' time series offsets to handle the adjustment of the datetime based on business hours and holidays. By including the holidays parameter in the CustomBusinessHour constructor, it can properly account for holidays in the adjustment process. This corrected function should resolve the issue reported on GitHub by properly handling the adjustment of the datetime object based on business hours and holidays.
