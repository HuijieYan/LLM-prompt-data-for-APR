1. Analysis:
   The buggy function is part of the "BusinessHourMixin" class and is intended to apply custom business hours to a given datetime. The function uses several other functions from the same class, such as "next_bday", "_next_opening_time", "_prev_opening_time", "_get_business_hours_by_sec", "_get_closing_time", "is_on_offset", and "_is_on_offset". The GitHub issue mentions a problem with pd.date_range producing more periods than expected when holidays are added.

2. Error Location:
   The potential error location within the buggy function is the logic for adjusting the datetime based on business hours and holidays.

3. Bug's Cause:
   (a). The buggy function "apply" attempts to adjust the input datetime based on business hours and holidays.
   (b). The "BusinessHourMixin" class contains multiple related functions for calculating business hours and adjusting datetime.
   (c). The related functions are used to handle business hour adjustments, check if a datetime is on offset, and get business hours by seconds.
   (d). The GitHub issue indicates that when holidays are added to the date_range function, it produces more periods than expected, suggesting a problem with how holidays are being handled in the code.

4. Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
   (a). Identify and fix the logic related to handling holidays within the "apply" function.
   (b). Review the logic for adjusting the datetime based on business hours and holidays to ensure it works as expected.
   (c). Consider how the related functions in the "BusinessHourMixin" class interact with the holiday logic and make necessary adjustments.
   (d). Test the updated code with the provided example and ensure that it produces the expected output.

5. Corrected Code:
```python
# Import necessary modules/classes
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessDay

# Fix the buggy function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # ... (other functions remain the same)

    # Updated apply function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # holiday handling logic
            if hasattr(self, 'holidays') and isinstance(self.holidays, list):
                for holiday in self.holidays:
                    if holiday == other.date():
                        # skip holiday and move to the next business day
                        other = self.next_bday(other)
            
            # remaining logic remains the same
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

# Test the corrected code with the given example from the GitHub issue
def test_buggy_function():
    start_date = datetime(2020, 11, 25, 10, 0)
    periods = 14
    custom_hour = CustomBusinessHour(start='10:00', holidays=['2020-11-26'])
    result = pd.date_range(start=start_date, periods=periods, freq=custom_hour)
    print(result)

test_buggy_function()
```

By incorporating the holiday handling logic within the "apply" function, the corrected code aims to address the issue mentioned in the GitHub problem description. The updated logic should skip holidays and move to the next business day, ensuring that the date_range function produces the expected output.
