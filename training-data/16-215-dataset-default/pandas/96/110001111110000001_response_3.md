The buggy function is a method called `apply` and it seems to be a part of a class related to business hours or offsets in the pandas library. The function takes another datetime object as input, and based on conditions related to business hours, it adjusts the input datetime object and returns the adjusted datetime.

The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is using the `pd.date_range` function to generate a date range using a custom business hour frequency. The test is failing with a ValueError related to frequency validation.

The error indicates that the inferred frequency from the passed values does not conform to the passed frequency. This means that the frequency used in the date range generation is not being correctly validated against the inferred frequency.

Based on the error message, the potential error location within the buggy function is likely to be the way the frequency is being handled when creating the date range, specifically with the CustomBusinessHour frequency.

To fix the bug, the custom business hour frequency needs to be correctly applied when creating the date range. This may involve revisiting the logic in the apply function to ensure proper adjustment for the custom business hour frequency.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Logic for adjusting the datetime based on business hours
        # (Unchanged from the original code)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Without the full context of the classes and dependencies, it's not possible to provide a complete fixed version. However, the logic inside the `apply` function needs to be carefully examined and potentially revised to properly handle the custom business hour frequency.
