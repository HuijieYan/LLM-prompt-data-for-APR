The buggy function `apply` is a method in the `BusinessHourMixin` class that is supposed to manipulate datetime objects based on business hours. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is trying to use a custom business hour with holidays in a date range, but it is producing more periods than expected.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the logic that adjusts the datetime based on business hours and holidays, as this is the functionality being tested.

The bug's cause is likely due to incorrect handling of holidays within the `apply` function, which is leading to an incorrect number of periods in the resulting date range. This is reflected in the error message, which indicates that the frequency is not conforming to the expected result.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include ensuring that the custom business hour with holidays is properly accounted for in the logic for adjusting the datetime based on business hours. This may involve modifications to how holidays are handled within the function.

Here is the corrected code for the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Adjust for holidays
        if getattr(other, "date", None) in self.holidays:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        
        # Adjust for business days
        if self._is_on_offset(other):
            return other

        if self.n >= 0:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected code, we first check if the date is a holiday, and adjust it to the next opening time accordingly. Then we adjust for business days and return the adjusted datetime. This should address the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue, ensuring correct behavior when using custom business hours with holidays.
