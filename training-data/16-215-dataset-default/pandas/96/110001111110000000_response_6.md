The issue with the `apply` function is that it is missing proper imports of `datetime` and `timedelta` from the `datetime` module, and it is also referencing `BusinessDay` and `ApplyTypeError` without proper context. Additionally, it's not clear where these references are supposed to come from.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` function with the assumption of context.

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Assuming BusinessDay and ApplyTypeError should be imported from elsewhere
# from some_module import BusinessDay, ApplyTypeError

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # assume that self.end and self.start are defined elsewhere
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not is_on_offset(self, other):
                other = _next_opening_time(self, other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not is_on_offset(self, other):
                other = _next_opening_time(self, other)
                other = _get_closing_time(self, other)

        # assume that self._get_business_hours_by_sec is defined elsewhere
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # assuming BusinessDay is a valid reference
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not next_bday(self).is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = _prev_opening_time(self, other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = (
                    _get_closing_time(self, _prev_opening_time(self, other)) - other
                )
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = _next_opening_time(self, other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = _next_opening_time(self, other) - other
                if (
                    bhour_remain > bhour
                    or bhour_remain == bhour
                    and nanosecond != 0
                ):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = _get_closing_time(
                        _next_opening_time(
                            self,
                            other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)
                        )
                    )

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Please note that the assumption of context was made in absence of specific context for the missing references. It's important to ensure that the missing functions and classes are properly imported or defined in the code. Additionally, if there are any further issues, it might require additional context or code to be resolved.
