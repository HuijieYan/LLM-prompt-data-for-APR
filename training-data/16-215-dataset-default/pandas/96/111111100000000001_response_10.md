The buggy function `apply` seems to have a complex logic for manipulating datetime objects based on business hours. The function is part of a class called `BusinessHourMixin` which appears to be related to business hours calculations.

The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the section where the datetime manipulation occurs, particularly in the while loops where the business hours are adjusted.

The cause of the bug could be related to incorrect logic in the datetime manipulation part of the function. It seems to involve adjusting the datetime object based on business days and remaining business hours, but it may not be handling all cases correctly.

Approaches for fixing the bug could involve simplifying the logic for datetime manipulation or thoroughly testing the function against various scenarios to identify and correct any incorrect logic.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessMixin, BusinessDay, ApplyTypeError

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    # ... (other functions from the same class)

    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            # reset nanosecond to handle Timestamp objects
            other = other.replace(nanosecond=0)

            # adjust other based on the business hour
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self.next_bday(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self.next_bday(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # adjust other based on business days
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)))
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd:
                other += BusinessDay(n=bd)

            # handle remaining business hours
            while r != 0:
                # Calculate the business hour left in this business time interval
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

                if r < bhour.total_seconds() // 60:
                    other += timedelta(minutes=r)
                    r = 0
                else:
                    other += bhour
                    r -= bhour.total_seconds() // 60

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This code simplifies the logic for adjusting the datetime object based on business days and remaining business hours. It also omits some unnecessary condition checks and uses a more straightforward approach for the datetime manipulation.
