Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the buggy function is setting the `other` variable to a datetime object and then using it without any checks for when `other` might not be a datetime object.

Bug's Cause:

(a) The buggy function is intended to take another datetime object as input and apply some business logic to it.
(b) The buggy class seems to be handling business hours and time intervals.
(c) The related functions contain several datetime-related operations and validations.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Add a check to ensure that `other` is a datetime object before proceeding with the rest of the function.
2. Handle the case when `other` is not a datetime object and raise an appropriate error.

Corrected Code:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin:
    # (other functions remain unchanged)

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):  # Check if other is a datetime object
            # rest of the code remains unchanged
            return other
        else:
            raise ValueError("Input must be a datetime object")
```
In the corrected code, we've added a check to ensure that `other` is a datetime object before proceeding with the rest of the function. If `other` is not a datetime object, it will raise a ValueError.
