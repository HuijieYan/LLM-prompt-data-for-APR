Here's the full code of the fixed function:

```python
from datetime import datetime
import pandas as pd

class BusinessHourMixin:
    @staticmethod
    def _is_on_offset(dt):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
        pass

    @staticmethod
    def _next_opening_time(dt):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
        pass

    @staticmethod
    def _get_closing_time(dt):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
        pass

    @staticmethod
    def _get_business_hours_by_sec(start, end):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
        pass

    @staticmethod
    def next_bday(dt):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
        pass

    @staticmethod
    def _prev_opening_time(dt):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
        pass

    @classmethod
    def apply(cls, self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n  # Assuming that self.n is defined somewhere
            
            # Adjust the business hour offset
            adjusted_datetime = cls._next_opening_time(other) if n >= 0 else cls._get_closing_time(cls._next_opening_time(other))

            return adjusted_datetime
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected code adjusts the business hour offset based on the value of `n`. It either gets the next opening time or the closing time based on the business hour offset.
