The buggy function `apply` needs to be corrected to handle the custom business hour offset properly. Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour
from pandas._libs.tslibs.timestamps import Timestamp

# This is the corrected version of the buggy function
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, (pd.Timestamp, Timestamp)):
        n = self.n
        if n == 0:
            return other

        # If the applied offset is a CustomBusinessHour, handle it accordingly
        if isinstance(self, CustomBusinessHour):
            bhour = self.onOffset(other)
            bdays = n // 9
            hours = n % 9
            days = bdays * 24 + hours
            result = bhour + pd.DateOffset(days=bdays, hours=hours)
            return result

        # For other standard cases
        result = other + self.n * self.freq
        return result
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With this corrected function, the failing test for `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` should pass.
