Potential error location within the problematic function:
The potential error location is in the part where the function attempts to adjust the datetime 'other' based on the business hours. There are complex calculations and condition checks that may not be working as intended.

Bug's cause:
The buggy function is supposed to adjust a given datetime based on the business hours, but the calculations and conditional checks are not working correctly, leading to incorrect adjustments and potential errors. This is causing the buggy behavior.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Simplify the logic for adjusting the datetime based on business hours to make it more clear and less error-prone.
2. Use specific test cases to verify the behavior of the function and ensure that it is working as intended.
3. Break down the complex calculations and conditional checks into smaller, more manageable steps to identify the potential source of the error.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin:
    # ... (other functions and class declarations)

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if not isinstance(other, datetime):
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

        # Reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0)

        n = self.n

        # Handle positive and negative offsets
        if n >= 0:
            # Adjust for end time and non-business hours
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            # Adjust for non-business hours and get closing time
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Handle business day count
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            other = self._adjust_for_business_days(other, bd)

        # Handle remaining business hours
        other = self._adjust_for_remaining_hours(other, r)

        return other

    def _adjust_for_business_days(self, dt, bd):
        if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(dt):
            prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(dt)
            remain = dt - prev_open
            dt = prev_open + BusinessDay(n=bd) + remain
        else:
            dt += BusinessDay(n=bd)
        return dt

    def _adjust_for_remaining_hours(self, dt, r):
        while r != 0:
            if self.n >= 0:
                dt, r = self._adjust_for_positive_offset(dt, r)
            else:
                dt, r = self._adjust_for_negative_offset(dt, r)
        return dt

    def _adjust_for_positive_offset(self, dt, r):
        bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(dt)) - dt
        if r < bhour.seconds // 60:
            dt += timedelta(minutes=r)
            r = 0
        else:
            r -= bhour.seconds // 60
            dt = self._next_opening_time(dt) + timedelta(seconds=bhour.seconds-1)
        return dt, r

    def _adjust_for_negative_offset(self, dt, r):
        bhour = self._next_opening_time(dt) - dt
        if r > bhour.seconds // 60:
            dt += timedelta(minutes=r)
            r = 0
        else:
            r -= bhour.seconds // 60
            dt = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(dt + timedelta(seconds=bhour.seconds-1)))
        return dt, r
```

In the corrected code, the functionality has been broken down into smaller functions to handle the different aspects of adjusting the datetime based on business hours. This makes the code easier to understand and maintain. Additionally, specific cases for positive and negative offsets have been handled separately for clarity.
