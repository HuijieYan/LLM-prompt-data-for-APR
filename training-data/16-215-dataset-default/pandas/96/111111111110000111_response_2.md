### Analysis:
The buggy function is responsible for calculating custom business hours, but it is failing when adding holidays using the `pd.date_range` function. The failing test provides an error message indicating a ValueError related to the frequency not conforming to the passed frequency. This indicates that the calculation of business hours with holidays is not working as expected, resulting in extra periods being added.

The GitHub issue posted by a user further confirms that adding holidays is causing unexpected behavior in the `pd.date_range` function when using periods.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by incorrect calculation and adjustment of business hours when holidays are added. The `apply` function is not properly handling holidays when adjusting the business hours, leading to an incorrect number of periods being generated.

### Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Adjust the logic for handling holidays within the `apply` function to ensure that the correct number of periods is generated when using `pd.date_range`.
2. Verify the logic for adjusting business hours to account for holidays and adjust it as necessary.
3. Test the function with different holiday scenarios to ensure accurate period generation.

### Corrected Code:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # ... (other functions remain unchanged)

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # remaining code unchanged

            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other) or other.date() in self.holidays:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start or other.date() in self.holidays:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other) or other.date() in self.holidays:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # remaining code unchanged

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With this correction, the `apply` function now properly handles holidays when adjusting business hours. This should resolve the issues reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue, ensuring that `pd.date_range` works correctly with custom business hours and holidays.
