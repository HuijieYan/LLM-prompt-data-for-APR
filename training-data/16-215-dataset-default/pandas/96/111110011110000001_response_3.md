Sure, here is the full code of the fixed function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0, nanosecond=0)
        n = self.n

        custom_business_day = BusinessDay(holidays=self.holidays, start=self.start, end=self.end)

        if n >= 0:
            other = custom_business_day.rollforward(other)
        else:
            other = custom_business_day.rollback(other)

        adjusted_date = custom_business_day.rollforward(other + pd.Timedelta(minutes=n))

        return adjusted_date.to_pydatetime()
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This version of the function uses the custom BusinessDay class to handle the custom business hours and holidays when adjusting the date, ensuring that the date range creation with custom holidays works correctly.
