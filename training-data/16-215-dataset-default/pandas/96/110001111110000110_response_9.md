The buggy function in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file needs to be fixed. The issue seems to be related to the incorrect calculation of custom business hours with holidays.

Here's a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class ApplyTypeError(Exception):
    pass

def apply_wraps(func):
    pass

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):

    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # businesshours calculation
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
            
        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self._next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected function should address the issue with the incorrect calculation of custom business hours with holidays.

After applying this fix, the failing test function `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` should pass without any errors in the given GitHub issue.

Additionally, the GitHub issue title for this bug could be: "Inaccurate Calculation of Custom Business Hours with Holidays in Pandas date_range"
