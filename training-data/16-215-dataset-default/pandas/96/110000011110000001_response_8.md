The buggy function is a part of the pandas library and is used to calculate CustomBusinessHour offset based on a specified start time and holidays. The failing test tests the functionality of this CustomBusinessHour offset for a specific date range and custom holidays. The error message indicates that the inferred frequency from passed values does not conform to the passed frequency CBH. This suggests that the issue lies in the calculation of the custom business hour offset within the buggy function.

The bug is likely caused by incorrect calculations within the `apply` function when adjusting the `other` datetime based on business days and business hours. This causes the inferred frequency to not conform to the passed frequency CBH, resulting in a value error.

To fix the bug, the calculations within the `apply` function need to be carefully reviewed to ensure that the adjustment of the `other` datetime based on business days and hours is accurate and correctly aligns with the specified offset (CBH).

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Check for holidays
        if other in self.holidays:
            # Move to the next business day
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        # Get the total business minutes in the business day
        business_minutes = sum((end - start).seconds // 60 for start, end in zip(self.start, self.end))

        minutes_to_adjust = self.n * business_minutes

        # Adjust other based on the specified offset
        other = other + timedelta(minutes=minutes_to_adjust)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected code, we calculate the minutes to adjust based on the total business minutes and the specified offset (`self.n`), and then adjust the `other` datetime accordingly. This approach ensures that the adjusted datetime aligns with the specified CustomBusinessHour offset. This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the error message.
