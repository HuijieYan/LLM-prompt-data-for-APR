The buggy function `apply` is intended to adjust a given datetime based on a set of business rules. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` aims to create a date range using custom business hours with holidays. However, the test fails with a ValueError, indicating that the frequency validation does not conform to the passed frequency.

The potential error location within the problematic function `apply` is likely in the logic that handles the adjustment of business days and remaining business hours, as this is where the frequency validation issue likely arises.

The cause of the bug is that the logic in the `apply` function for adjusting business days and remaining business hours is not handling holidays correctly, leading to an incorrect frequency validation result.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
1. Reviewing the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours to ensure it correctly accounts for holidays.
2. Verifying that the frequency validation is performed accurately based on the adjusted datetime.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # (Existing code remains unchanged)

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                if other in self.holidays:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                if other in self.holidays:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))

        # (The rest of the existing code remains unchanged)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected code, we have added checks for holidays after adjusting the business days and business hours, ensuring that the adjusted datetime does not fall on a holiday. This should address the issue reported in the failing test and GitHub issue.
