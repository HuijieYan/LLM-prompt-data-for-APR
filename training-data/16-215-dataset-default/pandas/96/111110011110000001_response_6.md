The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class seems to be causing an issue with the `CustomBusinessHour` offset. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is using this offset, and it is failing with a ValueError related to the frequency not conforming to the passed values.

The issue appears to be within the logic of adjusting the business hours in the `apply` function. It seems that the adjustment of business days and business hours might not be correctly handling the CustomBusinessHour offset, leading to the ValueError.

To fix this bug, it would be necessary to revisit the logic for adjusting business days and business hours within the `apply` function. The adjustments should take into account the CustomBusinessHour offset and ensure that the datetime calculations are compatible with this custom offset.

In addition, it might be useful to introduce specific handling for CustomBusinessHour offsets within the `apply` function to ensure that the adjustments align with the custom business hours.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # modify the datetime according to the CustomBusinessHour offset
        other = CustomBusinessHour(start=self.start, holidays=self.holidays).rollback(other)
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
This correction addresses the issue by explicitly using the CustomBusinessHour start time and holidays to rollback the datetime according to the custom offset, ensuring that the adjustments align with the custom business hours.
