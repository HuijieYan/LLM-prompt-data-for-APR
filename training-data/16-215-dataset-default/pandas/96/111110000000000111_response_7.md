1. The buggy function 'apply' is a part of the BusinessHourMixin class, which is related to business hours and time calculations. The GitHub issue mentions a problem with using pandas' date_range function in conjunction with CustomBusinessHour and holidays, which seems to be related to the business hour calculations.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be the calculation of business days and business hours, as well as the adjustment of the datetime based on the business hours.

3. The bug's cause:
   - The buggy function 'apply' in BusinessHourMixin class is responsible for adjusting datetimes based on business hours, but it seems to be encountering issues in specific edge cases, resulting in unexpected behavior when combined with pandas' date_range and holidays.
   - The GitHub issue suggests that adding holidays into the CustomBusinessHour frequency leads to more periods than expected, indicating a problem with the date calculations in the presence of holidays.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Refactoring the logic of the 'apply' function to handle holidays more effectively and accurately adjust datetimes based on business hours.
   - Ensure that the adjustment algorithm in the 'apply' function works seamlessly with pandas' date_range and is not affected by the presence of holidays.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function 'apply':

```python
import pandas as pd
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessDay
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # ... (other class functions)

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # CustomBusinessHour frequency with holidays using Pandas
            if isinstance(self, CustomBusinessHour) and hasattr(self, 'holidays'):
                business_hour_offset = pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour(
                    start=self.start_time, holidays=self.holidays
                )
                adjusted_datetime = business_hour_offset.apply(other)
                return adjusted_datetime
            else:
                raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected code uses the 'apply' function to handle a CustomBusinessHour frequency with holidays effectively. It checks if the frequency is a CustomBusinessHour and if it has holidays specified, then applies the offset and returns the adjusted datetime. This should address the issue mentioned in the GitHub post regarding unexpected behavior with the date_range function.
