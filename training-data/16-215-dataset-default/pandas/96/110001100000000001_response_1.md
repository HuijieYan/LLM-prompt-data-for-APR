1. The buggy function applies business hour offsets to a datetime object. It calls several related functions in the same file, such as _is_on_offset, _next_opening_time, _get_closing_time, _get_business_hours_by_sec, and next_bday.

2. The potential error location within the buggy function could be the logic for adjusting the business hours.

3. (a) The buggy function has a complex logic for adjusting the business hours, including handling different cases for positive and negative offsets, adjusting for business days, and adjusting for remaining business hours.
   (b) The related functions, such as _is_on_offset, _next_opening_time, _get_closing_time, and _get_business_hours_by_sec, are used to support the logic for adjusting business hours.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Simplifying the logic for adjusting the business hours to make it easier to understand and maintain.
   - Adding more specific error handling and debugging statements to identify the exact location of the issue.
   - Reviewing the related functions to ensure they are correctly supporting the logic for adjusting business hours.

5. Corrected code:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, nanosecond=0)
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other))

        business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                else:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
        else:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour_remain - timedelta(seconds=1)))
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected code, the logic for adjusting the business hours has been simplified and streamlined to reduce complexity and potential issues. Additionally, the code has been adjusted to handle edge cases more effectively.
