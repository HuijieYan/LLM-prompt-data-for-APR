The buggy function is supposed to adjust the datetime based on business hours, specifically for the CustomBusinessHour frequency.

The potential error is likely in the logic for adjusting the datetime based on business days and business hours within the function apply. The failing test is related to CustomBusinessHour frequency and the error message indicates a validation error with the frequency.

The bug is caused by the incorrect adjustment of the datetime based on the CustomBusinessHour frequency. The logic for adjusting the datetime based on business days and business hours is not correctly handling the CustomBusinessHour frequency, leading to the validation error encountered in the failing test.

To fix the bug, the logic for adjusting the datetime based on business days and business hours needs to be updated to properly handle the CustomBusinessHour frequency.

Here's the corrected code for the apply function:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour
import pandas as pd

def apply_wraps(func):
    def wrapper(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            if isinstance(self, CustomBusinessHour):
                other = self.apply(other)
            else:
                raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
        return other
    return wrapper

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if isinstance(self, CustomBusinessHour):
            n = self.n
            if n > 0:
                for _ in range(n):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                for _ in range(abs(n)):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected code uses the apply_wraps decorator to handle the CustomBusinessHour case and applies the adjustments to the datetime based on the provided CustomBusinessHour frequency. This corrected code should pass the failing test.
