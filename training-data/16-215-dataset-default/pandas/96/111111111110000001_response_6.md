Upon analysis, the potential error in the buggy function is with the `other` object being incorrectly adjusted and calculated based on business hours. The code is also handling holidays in a way that is causing the test to fail.

The cause of the bug is due to the incorrect adjustment of `other` and not handling holidays properly.

To fix the bug, the following approaches can be taken:
1. Ensure that the `other` object is correctly adjusted and calculated based on business hours.
2. Handle holidays properly within the function to align with the requirements of the test.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import pandas as pd

# ...

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    
    # ...

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # handle holidays
            if other in self.holidays:
                return other
            
            n = self.n
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            
            # adjust for business hours
            if n >= 0:
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, the function is handling holidays properly and updating the `other` object based on business hours. This should address the failure in the test.
