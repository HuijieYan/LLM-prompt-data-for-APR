The buggy function `apply` aims to adjust the input `other` to align with a custom business hour defined by the variable `self`. The failing test is trying to create a date range using this custom business hour, but it fails with a ValueError related to the frequency not conforming to the expected frequency.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the logic that adjusts the `other` input to align with the custom business hour defined by `self`. It seems that the adjustments made to `other` are not correctly following the defined business hour, causing the frequency mismatch.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for adjusting `other` to ensure it aligns with the custom business hour. Additionally, it's important to ensure that the frequency of the adjusted `other` matches the expected frequency.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply` function:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import pandas as pd

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        freq = self.freq

        # Adjust other to align with the custom business hour
        if n >= 0:
            current_time = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            if current_time.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(current_time):
                other = self._next_opening_time(current_time)
        else:
            if current_time.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(hours=1)  # move to previous business day
            if not self._is_on_offset(current_time):
                other = self._next_opening_time(current_time)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

# Modified and fixed code ends here
```

In this corrected code, we've adjusted the logic to align `other` with the custom business hour defined by `self`. This code modification should fix the bug and ensure that the function passes the failing test.
