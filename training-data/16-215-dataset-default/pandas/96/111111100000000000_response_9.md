Here is the fixed version of the `apply` function:
```python
import datetime

# this is the fixed version of the buggy function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # other functions defined as before

    # this is the fixed version of the buggy function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime.datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
            other = datetime.datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            # other part of the function remains unchanged
            # ...
```
