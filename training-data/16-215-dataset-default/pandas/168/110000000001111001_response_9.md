The bug in the function seems to be located in the section where it checks the validity of the input parameters `key` and `level`. It seems that the function is not handling the different cases for `keys` correctly, leading to unexpected behavior. 

One possible approach to fix the bug is to refactor the logic for handling the `keys` input parameter to ensure that it is processed correctly for different scenarios. This may involve checking the type of `key` and handling it appropriately based on its type.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis,level,sort, while
    the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps

    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # validate that the passed single level is compatible with the passed
    # axis of the object
    if level is not None:
        # handling of level based on its type
        if isinstance(level, list) and len(level) == 1:
            level = level[0]

        if key is None and isinstance(level, str):
            key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
            level = None
        # ... (other cases)

    # rest of the function remains unchanged

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This corrected code aims to handle the different cases for the `key` and `level` input parameters, ensuring that they are processed correctly for different scenarios as observed in the input/output variable information provided.
