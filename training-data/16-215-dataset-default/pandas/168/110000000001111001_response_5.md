The issue in the provided function seems to be caused by a problem with the handling of the `keys` and `match_axis_length` variables. These variables are not being set correctly, which leads to incorrect behavior later in the function.

To fix the bug, the handling of `keys` and `match_axis_length` needs to be adjusted. Specifically, the code should check whether the length of `keys` is equal to the length of `group_axis`, and set `match_axis_length` accordingly. Additionally, the `keys` variable should be set to a list containing the input `key` value, rather than directly setting it to the input `key`.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (existing function implementation)

    # Adjust the handling of keys and match_axis_length
    if key is not None:
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)
    else:
        keys = []
        match_axis_length = False
    
    # ... (remaining implementation remains unchanged)

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

By making these adjustments to the handling of `keys` and `match_axis_length`, the function should now behave as expected and satisfy the provided test cases.
