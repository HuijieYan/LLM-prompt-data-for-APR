The buggy function `_get_grouper` is failing to group by columns when the `axis` parameter is set to 1. It is erroneously raising a KeyError when grouping by the columns. This contradicts the documentation for the `groupby()` function, which indicates that grouping by the columns in the DataFrame should be supported.

The bug is likely located in the area of the function where the grouping by columns is being handled. The function seems to iterate through the keys and look for matches in the DataFrame, but it is not correctly identifying and handling grouping by columns.

The potential error seems to be in the section where the function is checking for the presence of the grouping keys in the DataFrame columns. It is also possible that the function is not correctly handling the grouping keys when they are passed as a list.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly handle grouping by columns when the `axis` parameter is set to 1. It should iterate through the keys and perform the grouping operation on the columns of the DataFrame. It should also handle cases where the grouping keys are passed as a list.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    if axis == 1:  # Check if grouping by columns
        groupings = [obj[key] for key in key]
        # Perform the grouping operation on the columns of the DataFrame
        grouped = pd.concat(groupings, axis=1)
        return grouped
    else:
        # Perform the grouping operation on the index of the DataFrame
        return obj.groupby(by=key, axis=axis)
```

The corrected function checks if the `axis` parameter is set to 1 and performs the grouping operation on the columns of the DataFrame accordingly. It then concatenates the grouped columns and returns the result. If the `axis` parameter is not set to 1, it performs the grouping operation on the index of the DataFrame.

This corrected function should successfully resolve the issue of not being able to group by columns when the `axis` parameter is set to 1, as reported in the GitHub issue.
