The fixed function with the implementation from the provided hints is as follows:

```python
from pandas.core.groupby import BaseGrouper
from pandas.core.arrays.categorical import is_categorical_dtype
from pandas.core.indexes.multi import MultiIndex
import numpy as np

def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis,level,sort, while
    the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps

    """

    # Getting the axis
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    block = obj._data
    if observed and block:
        if all(op_type == "PeriodDtype" for op_type in block.mgr._rebuild_levels_and_labels(".observed", observed)) and axis == 1:
            mask = {
                col_name: ~categorical.isna()
                for col_name, (_, categorical) in block.items.items()
            }

        if mutated is False:

```

In the provided code, the function has been modified based on the hints provided in the failing test cases. The rest of the implementation logic needs to take into account the specific error cases and utilize the given hints to address the root cause of the bugs.
