The issue is likely in the code that handles the 'key' input parameter, as the function is intended to group by the columns when axis=1, but it does not handle column names correctly.

The problem seems to be related to the handling of column names when grouping by columns. The code might be incorrectly assuming that the 'key' input parameter is always a list of keys, rather than a single key (column name) when axis=1. This could be the cause of the KeyError being raised.

The expected output for grouping along columns with the key "x" should be a DataFrame with the index [0, 1, 0] but grouped (and summed) columns [10, 20]. However, the actual output likely raises a KeyError because the function is not correctly processing the column names when axis=1.

To fix this bug, the code should correctly handle the 'key' input parameter when axis=1 to group by columns based on the column names provided.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    if axis == 1 and isinstance(key, str):
        if key in obj:
            key = [key]
    # ... rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With this correction, the function should correctly handle the 'key' input parameter when axis=1, allowing for grouping by columns based on the column names provided.

This fix addresses the GitHub issue as well, as it resolves the problem of not being able to implicitly select columns by name when using groupby with axis=1.
