The bug in the provided function appears to be related to incorrectly grouping by columns when using the `groupby` method with `axis=1`. The function is supposed to accept a column name or a list of column names to perform the groupby operation, but it fails to do so and raises a KeyError.

The cause of the bug appears to be a problem with the logic of identifying and processing the input key when `axis=1`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
1. Modifying the logic for identifying and processing the input key when `axis=1` to correctly handle grouping by column names.
2. Ensuring that the function properly handles the provided column names and performs the groupby operation as expected.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    if axis == 1 and isinstance(key, str):
        key = [key]  # convert single column name to list

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)

    # create the internals grouper
    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

With this correction, the `groupby` method should now correctly handle the grouping by column names when `axis=1` is used, resolving the issue posted in the GitHub report.
