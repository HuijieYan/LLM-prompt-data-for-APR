The bug in the function `_get_grouper` is due to the incorrect handling of grouping by column names when using the `groupby` method with `axis=1`. The code is raising a `KeyError` when attempting to group by column names.

The failing test code provides an example of this issue, as it's attempting to group by the column name "x" using `df.groupby('x', axis=1)`, but it's resulting in a KeyError.

The buggy function `_get_grouper` is responsible for creating the grouping for the `groupby` operation. It involves creating a `Grouping` object for each key, combined into a `BaseGrouper`.

The `groupings` list is expected to contain the Grouping objects, but in the failing test, it's empty. This is likely the source of the problem, as it means the function is unable to correctly identify and create the Groupings for the groupby operation.

The error message from the failing test provides evidence of the issue, showing that a KeyError is being raised when trying to perform the groupby operation with `axis=1`.

To fix this bug, the `_get_grouper` function should correctly identify and create the necessary Grouping objects for the groupby operation with `axis=1`.

The corrected code for the `_get_grouper` function is as follows:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    if axis == 0:
        # Perform groupby operation by index
        groupings = [Grouping(group_axis, g, level=level) for g in [key] if key is not None]
        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort)
        return grouper, [], obj
    elif axis == 1:
        # Perform groupby operation by columns
        group_axis = obj.columns
        keys = [key] if isinstance(key, str) else key
        groupings = [Grouping(group_axis, g, level=level) for g in keys]
        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort)
        return grouper, [], obj
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid axis value")

```

This corrected code includes a conditional check for `axis=1`, which correctly creates the Grouping objects for the groupby operation by columns.

With this corrected code, the failing test should now pass, and the function should correctly handle the groupby operation with `axis=1`.

This correction should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post and provide the expected behavior for grouping by column names.
