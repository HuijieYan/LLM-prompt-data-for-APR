The potential error in the buggy function seems to be in the section where it handles the `level` parameter. There are multiple conditions and checks related to the `level` parameter, including handling MultiIndex, checking its type, and validating its values. It also handles different scenarios for `key` and `group_axis`.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Refactor the code to simplify the conditions and checks related to the `level` parameter.
2. Ensure that the function has appropriate error handling and validation for the input parameters.
3. Address the potential issues with MultiIndex and ensure consistent handling of the `level` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # The code has been refactored and simplified for the level parameter handling
    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if isinstance(level, list) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]
            if key is None and np.isscalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if isinstance(level, (list, tuple)):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")
    
    # Rest of the code remains unchanged

    # (Rest of the function follows...)
```

In the corrected version, the code related to the `level` parameter has been simplified, and unnecessary conditions have been removed to make the function more straightforward and easier to understand.
