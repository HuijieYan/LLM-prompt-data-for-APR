Based on the failing test and error message, it seems that the issue lies within the `_get_grouper` function. The function is not handling the case where `key` is a list correctly. Instead of treating each element of the list as a separate key, it currently tries to handle the entire list as a single key, leading to a KeyError.

The issue is likely related to the determination of whether the `key` is a single key or a list of keys. The code is not correctly identifying the case where `key` is a list and then handling it appropriately.

To fix this issue, the `_get_grouper` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the case where `key` is a list. It should iterate over the elements of the list and create separate groupings for each key.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if isinstance(key, list):
        groupings = []
        exclusions = []

        for k in key:
            ping = Grouping(
                group_axis,
                k,
                obj=obj,
                name=None,
                level=None,
                sort=sort,
                observed=observed,
                in_axis=True
            )
            groupings.append(ping)
            exclusions.append(k)

        if len(groupings) == 0 and len(obj):
            raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")

        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        return grouper, exclusions, obj

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged for other cases)
```

This modification ensures that when `key` is a list, the function correctly creates separate Grouping objects for each key and returns them as part of the BaseGrouper.

With this correction, the `_get_grouper` function should now be able to handle the case where `key` is a single key or a list of keys, and pass the failing test.
