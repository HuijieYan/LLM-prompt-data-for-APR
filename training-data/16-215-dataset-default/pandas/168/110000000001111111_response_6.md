The issue with the buggy function is that it does not properly handle grouping by columns when using the `groupby` function with `axis=1`. This causes a KeyError even when attempting to group by a valid column name.

The root cause of the issue is that the function does not handle column grouping correctly. It fails to properly identify and group by columns when the `axis=1` argument is used.

To fix this issue, the function should be modified to correctly handle grouping by columns when `axis=1` is specified. This can be achieved by ensuring that the function correctly identifies and processes columns as the grouping criterion, and then applies the necessary group operations.

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    if axis == 1:
        group_axis = obj.columns
        if key is None:
            key = group_axis
    else:
        group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This modification ensures that when `axis=1`, the function uses the dataframe columns as the group axis and sets the key to the columns if it is not specified. This allows the function to correctly handle grouping by columns.

With this modification, the function is able to handle grouping by columns correctly, resolving the issue described in the GitHub report.
