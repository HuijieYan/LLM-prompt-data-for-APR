The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the section where the function checks the type of `group_axis` using `isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex)`. This section is likely to cause issues due to missing imports and incorrect logic.

The bug is likely caused by the missing import statement for `MultiIndex` and `Grouper` classes. Additionally, there are inconsistencies in the type checking and logic, leading to potential errors in the function's execution.

To fix the bug, the missing import statements need to be included, and the type checking and logical conditions need to be reviewed and corrected.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# Updated imports
from pandas import MultiIndex, Grouper

# Corrected function
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    # rest of the docstring goes here
    ...

    """

    # rest of the function implementation

    # validate that the passed single level is compatible with the passed
    # axis of the object
    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None

        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        "level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
                    )
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    # rest of the function implementation

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

In the corrected code, the missing imports have been included at the beginning of the function, and the type checking and logical conditions have been reviewed and corrected for potential errors.
