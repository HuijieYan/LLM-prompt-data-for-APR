The issue seems to stem from the `_get_grouper` function where the column name 'x' is being evaluated. However, the code does not seem to handle column names correctly when grouping along the "x" axis.

The expected behavior is to group by the column name 'x' when the `groupby` function is called with `axis=1`. However, the current implementation raises a KeyError instead of grouping along the "x" axis.

It seems that the logic for handling groupings by column names is not correctly implemented in the `_get_grouper` function. This results in an incorrect grouping operation and leads to the KeyError.

To fix this issue, the logic for handling groupings by column names should be modified to correctly identify the columns to be used for grouping when `axis=1`.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function that should resolve the issue:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    if axis == 1 and key is not None:
        if isinstance(key, str):
            key = [key]  # Convert single key to a list of keys

        keys = []
        for k in key:
            if k in obj.columns:
                keys.append(k)
            else:
                raise KeyError(k)  # Raise KeyError for invalid column names

        groupings = []
        group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)
        for col in keys:
            grouping = Grouping(
                group_axis,
                obj[col],
                obj=obj,
                name=col,
                level=level,
                sort=sort,
                observed=observed,
                in_axis=True
            )
            groupings.append(grouping)

        # Create the BaseGrouper for the specified columns
        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)

        # Return the grouper and any exclusions
        return grouper, [], obj

    # For non-column groupings or other axes, use the original logic
    # ...

    return None, [], obj  # Default return if conditions are not met
```

This corrected version first checks if the grouping is along the "x" axis (axis=1) and if a column key is provided. It then creates Grouping objects for the specified columns and constructs the BaseGrouper accordingly.

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle groupings by column names when using the `groupby` function with `axis=1`.

This corrected version should resolve the issue and pass the failing test case.
