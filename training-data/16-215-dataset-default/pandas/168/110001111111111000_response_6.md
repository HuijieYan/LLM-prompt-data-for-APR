Based on the failing tests and error messages provided, it seems that the issue is related to how the `key` parameter is being handled in the `_get_grouper` function. The function is not handling a list of keys correctly, which leads to a `KeyError` when attempting to access the elements.

To resolve this issue, the `_get_grouper` function needs to be modified to correctly handle a list of keys. It should iterate over the list of keys, creating Grouping objects for each one and combining them into a BaseGrouper.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function, taking into account the failing test cases and error messages:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis, level, sort, while
    the passed-in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing-in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed and we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed values

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps
    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    keys = key if isinstance(key, list) else [key]
    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for i, k in enumerate(keys):
        # Create Grouping for each key
        group = Grouping(
            group_axis,
            k,
            obj=obj,
            name=k,
            level=level,
            sort=sort,
            observed=observed
        )
        groupings.append(group)

        # Add to exclusions
        exclusions.append(k)

    # Create the internals grouper
    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

With this change, the `_get_grouper` function iterates over the `keys` and creates a `Grouping` object for each key, which is then appended to the `groupings` list. Finally, it returns the `grouper` and `exclusions` as expected.

After making this change, run the failing tests again to ensure that the correction resolves the issue. If all the tests pass without any `KeyError` exceptions, then the issue with the `key` parameter in the `_get_grouper` function has been successfully addressed.
