The bug in the provided function is likely in the section that handles the grouping by columns. The `keys` variable is expected to hold the group keys, but it is not correctly populated, causing issues with the grouping process.

The GitHub issue also confirms that there is a problem with grouping along columns when using the `groupby` function.

The bug is likely caused by a failure to properly handle grouping by columns, resulting in incorrect keys and therefore incorrect grouping behavior.

To fix the bug, the function should check for the axis parameter and properly handle grouping by columns. This would involve populating the `keys` variable correctly and ensuring that the grouping behavior is aligned with the expected output when grouping by columns.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if axis == 1 and key is not None:
        keys = key
    else:
        keys = [key]

    # rest of the function remains unchanged

    # create the internals grouper
    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This corrected function properly handles grouping by column names based on the `axis` and `key` parameters provided.

This updated code should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread and the discrepancies found in the input/output variable information.
