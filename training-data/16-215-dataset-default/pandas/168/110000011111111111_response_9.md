### Bug Analysis:

The issue is related to the `groupby` method not working as expected when trying to group along the columns using the column names.

1. The `groupby` method with `axis=1` is expected to group along the columns by column name(s).
2. However, the function `_get_grouper` is not handling the case where `key` is a list of column names correctly.
3. This leads to a KeyError when trying to group by column name(s).

### Bug Cause:

The `key` parameter is not handled correctly when it is a list of column names. This leads to the function trying to access the list element `gpr` as a key directly, causing the KeyError.

### Possible Approaches:

To fix the bug, the function `_get_grouper` should be modified to correctly handle the case where `key` is a list of column names. It should iterate over the list of keys and create a Grouping for each column name, combined into a BaseGrouper.

### Corrected Code:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # existing code...

    if isinstance(key, list):
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)
        
        groupings = []
        exclusions = []
        
        for i, column_name in enumerate(keys):
            if column_name in group_axis:
                in_axis, name, gpr = True, column_name, obj[column_name]
                exclusions.append(name)
            else:
                raise KeyError(column_name)

            ping = Grouping(
                group_axis,
                gpr,
                obj=obj,
                name=name,
                level=level,
                sort=sort,
                observed=observed,
                in_axis=in_axis,
            )
            
            groupings.append(ping)

    # remaining code...

    # create the internals grouper
    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

With the above modification, the function will correctly handle the case where `key` is a list of column names and create Groupings for each column name, resulting in a successful grouping operation along the columns.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information, as well as resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.
