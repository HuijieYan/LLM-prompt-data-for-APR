The potential error in the function is likely in the section where it determines the groupings based on the input parameters `axis` and `key`. The function is not correctly handling grouping by columns when the `key` is provided as a string or list of strings.

The bug's cause is that the function fails to correctly interpret the `key` parameter when grouping by columns. This leads to a KeyError when trying to group by columns using the provided key.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to modify the section of the function that handles the `key` parameter to correctly interpret it when grouping by columns. This may involve properly handling the `key` as a string or list of strings when `axis=1`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    if axis == 1 and isinstance(key, str):
        key = [key]  # Convert the string key to a list of strings

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # ... rest of the function remains unchanged
```

This corrected code ensures that if the `axis` is 1 and the `key` is provided as a string, it will be converted to a list of strings so that the grouping by columns is properly handled.

This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub issue and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
