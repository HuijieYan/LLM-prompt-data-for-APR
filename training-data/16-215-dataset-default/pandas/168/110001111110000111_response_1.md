The potential error in the buggy function seems to be related to the way it handles grouping by columns. It appears that the function is not correctly identifying the columns when using `groupby` along the axis of the columns, resulting in a KeyError.

The issue seems to be in the logic of the `_get_grouper` function where it fails to handle grouping by columns effectively. This is causing the KeyError to be raised when trying to group along the columns.

To fix this bug, the logic within the `_get_grouper` function needs to be modified to correctly identify and handle grouping by columns. Additionally, the function needs to ensure that it is able to correctly handle grouping by column names when using `groupby` along the axis of the columns.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # validate that the passed single level is compatible with the passed axis of the object
    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None

        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.columns.name != level:
                    raise ValueError("level name {} is not the name of the columns".format(level))
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False
    else:
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    any_callable = any(callable(g) or isinstance(g, dict) for g in keys)
    any_groupers = any(isinstance(g, Grouper) for g in keys)
    any_arraylike = any(
        isinstance(g, (list, tuple, Series, Index, np.ndarray)) for g in keys
    )

    if not any_callable and not any_arraylike and not any_groupers and match_axis_length and level is None:
        all_in_columns_index = all(
            g in obj.columns or g in obj.columns.names for g in keys
        )
        if not all_in_columns_index:
            keys = [com.asarray_tuplesafe(keys)]

    levels = [level] * len(keys)
    groupings = []

    for i, (gpr, level) in enumerate(zip(keys, levels)):
        in_axis, name = True, gpr
        exclusions = [name]

        # create the Grouping
        ping = Grouping(
            group_axis,
            gpr,
            obj=obj,
            name=name,
            level=level,
            sort=sort,
            observed=observed,
            in_axis=in_axis,
        )

        groupings.append(ping)

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This corrected code should resolve the issue by correctly handling the grouping by columns and ensuring that it passes the failing test. It also addresses the problem described in the GitHub issue.
