    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis,level,sort, while
    the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps

The issue in the `_get_grouper` function is with the handling of the `key`. The function should validate and process the `key` argument and return a valid `group_axis`. I have added a new internal function `validate_key` to handle that logic. The rest of the function remains unchanged. This should resolve the KeyErrors and ValueError that were occurring due to invalid `key` arguments.
