The issue is with the `_get_grouper` function. The specific error message indicates a `KeyError` on line 615 of the function.

The failing test is calling the `groupby` function on a DataFrame using `group_name = ['x']` and passing this to the `df.groupby(group_name, axis=1).sum()` function call. This is causing the error.

Upon analyzing the `_get_grouper` function, it seems that there are multiple conditional checks and conversions that are leading to the `KeyError`. The handling of the `key` variable and its conversion to a list seems to be causing the issue.

Based on these observations, a possible approach to fixing the bug would be to simplify the conditional logic for handling the `key` and its conversion to a list. Additionally, the handling of the `level` variable and its compatibility with `group_axis` should be reviewed for any potential issues.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (existing code)

    # Handling the 'key' variable
    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj
    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        key = list(key)  # Convert tuple to a list

    # Simplified handling of the 'key' variable
    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
    else:
        keys = key

    # ... (existing code)

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

By making these changes, the `_get_grouper` function should handle the `key` variable and its conversion to a list more effectively, and this should address the `KeyError` issue observed in the failing test.
