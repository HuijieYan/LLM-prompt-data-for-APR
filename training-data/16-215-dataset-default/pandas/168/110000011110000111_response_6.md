The problematic function `_get_grouper` is used in the failing test `test_groupby_axis_1` from the file `pandas/tests/groupby/test_groupby.py`. The failing test is failing with a `KeyError` when attempting to group by the "x" column.

The code in question seems to be attempting to group by the columns using the `group_name` argument, but it is failing due to some internal error in the `get_grouper` function.

The error message indicates that a `KeyError` is raised when the function attempts to group by the specified column.

Based on the error message and provided code, it seems that the issue is related to the code's inability to correctly interpret the group name when grouping by the columns.

To resolve the issue, the following approaches can be considered:
1. Ensure that the function correctly handles the case when attempting to group by column names.
2. Verify that the function is properly identifying and mapping the column names for grouping.

Additionally, it might be necessary to ensure that the function is correctly identifying and handling column names and indices.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # code for handling column grouping
    if isinstance(key, (str, list)):
        if axis == 1 and key in obj.columns:
            grouper = BaseGrouper(obj[key], sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
            return grouper, [], obj

    # rest of the function...
```

In this corrected code, we include specific handling for grouping by column names when the axis is 1. This modification should enable the function to correctly handle column grouping and resolve the KeyError issue.

Additionally, this correction addresses the issue described in the GitHub post and should now enable the function to correctly group by columns and pass the failing test.
