The bug seems to be caused by the `_get_grouper` function's inability to correctly handle grouping by columns when using the `groupby` method with a specified axis of 1. The function should be able to group by columns when using the column names as the group keys.

The discrepancy between the expected and actual input/output variable values suggests that the function is not correctly processing the input parameters and returning the expected output.

The GitHub issue indicates that when attempting to group by columns using the `groupby` method with the specified axis of 1, a KeyError is raised even though the intent is to group by the column labels.

To fix the bug, the `_get_grouper` function should be modified to correctly handle grouping by columns when using the column names as the group keys. This may involve updating the logic to handle the input parameters correctly and return the expected output for grouping by columns.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    if axis == 1:
        group_axis = obj._get_axis(1)  # Get the column axis
        key = obj.columns if key is None else key  # Use the column names as the group key
    else:
        group_axis = obj._get_axis(0)  # Get the index axis

    # Rest of the function remains the same...

```

With this correction, the `_get_grouper` function should now correctly handle grouping by columns when using the column names as the group keys and resolve the issue described in the GitHub post.
