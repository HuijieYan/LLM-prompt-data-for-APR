The issue in the buggy function is that the keys variable is being set to a list containing the single key, regardless of whether key is already a list or not. This results in match_axis_length being set to False when it should be True if key is already a list.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic for setting the keys variable to ensure that it remains a list if key is already a list, and not a scalar. We can use the `if` condition to check if key is a list or not before assigning it to the keys variable.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)

    # check if key is already a list
    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False
    else:
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # ... (remaining code of the function remains unchanged)

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

With this change, the keys variable will be set correctly and match_axis_length will be set based on whether key is a list or not. This updated code should fix the bug and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
