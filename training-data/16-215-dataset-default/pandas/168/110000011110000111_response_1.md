1. Analysis:
The buggy function is _get_grouper, which is related to the test function test_groupby_axis_1. The error message indicates a KeyError while attempting to group by column "x". This behavior directly relates to the reported issue on GitHub, where implicit selection by column name(s) using groupby(axis=1) is not working as expected.

2. Potential Error Location:
The error is likely located in the section of the code where it determines if the passed key is in the index or columns. This check seems to be failing when trying to group by column "x".

3. Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is that the _get_grouper function is not handling the implicit selection by column name(s) correctly. It fails to recognize the column name "x" as a valid key for grouping.

4. Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
   - Update the logic to correctly handle the implicit grouping by column names.
   - Ensure that the function properly distinguishes between grouping by index and grouping by columns.
   - Handle the scenario of grouping by column names explicitly in the code.

5. Corrected Code:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if isinstance(key, str):
        # Group by column name
        key = [key]

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```
In this corrected code, an additional check is added to handle the case when the key is a string, indicating a column name for implicit selection during grouping. This change should address the issue reported in the failing test and GitHub, allowing implicit selection by column name(s) to work as expected.
