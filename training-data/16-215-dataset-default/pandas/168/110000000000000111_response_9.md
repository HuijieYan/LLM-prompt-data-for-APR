1. Analysis:
The buggy function is related to the GitHub issue as it describes an issue with the groupby() function in Pandas not properly grouping along columns when using the "by" argument with axis=1. The buggy function appears to be responsible for handling the grouping logic based on the "by" parameter and the axis.

2. Potential Error Location:
The potential error location within the buggy function could be related to the logic for processing the "by" parameter when the axis is specified as 1.

3. Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug seems to be related to the incorrect processing of the "by" parameter when the axis=1 is specified. This could be due to a mismatch in the logic for handling column names versus index names in the grouping process.

4. Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
   a. Review and revise the logic for handling the "by" parameter when the axis is specified as 1 to ensure proper grouping by column names.
   b. Consider ensuring that the function checks for the type of data (index or column name) and handles the grouping accordingly.

5. Corrected Code:
Here's the corrected version of the _get_grouper function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None

        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if isinstance(obj, DataFrame):
                    if level not in obj.columns:
                        raise ValueError("level name {} is not the name of a column".format(level))
                else:
                    raise ValueError("level name {} is not the name of a column".format(level))

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

The correction involves handling the level parameter based on the type of object (DataFrame or Series) and ensuring that the validation for column names is done accordingly. This change should address the issue described in the GitHub report related to the groupby() function not properly grouping along columns.
