The issue seems to be related to how the `keys` list is being constructed. It appears that each item is being processed separately instead of as a group, leading to errors when using multi-level index columns. 

To fix this issue, I will rewrite the `_get_grouper` function to construct the `keys` list properly and ensure proper validation for multi-level index columns.

Here's the corrected implementation of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis, level, sort, while
    the passed-in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing-in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps

    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # Process keys for multi-level index columns
    if level is not None and isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
        keys = [group_axis.get_level_values(level)]
        levels = [None]
    else:
        keys = [key]
        levels = [level]

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    # Creating the Groupings based on keys and levels
    for i, (key, level) in enumerate(zip(keys, levels)):
        if isinstance(key, Grouper):
            binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
            if key.key is None:
                groupings.append(grouper)
            else:
                groupings.append(grouper)
                exclusions.append({key.key})
        elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
            groupings.append(key)
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Unknown key: {key}")

    # Create the internals grouper
    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

With this corrected implementation, the `keys` and `levels` are constructed based on the axis and level parameters, ensuring that they are properly processed. The function also utilizes an error-raising exception to handle unknown key types.

I will test this corrected function using the failing test case to ensure that the issues are resolved.
