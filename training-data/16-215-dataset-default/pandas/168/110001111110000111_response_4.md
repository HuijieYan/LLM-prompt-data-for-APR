The bug is caused by the `_get_grouper` function not correctly handling the grouping by column names when using the `axis=1` parameter. The function is not properly identifying the columns as groupers and is raising a KeyError.

The potential error location is within the section of the function that checks for the actual grouper and is not correctly identifying the columns as groupers.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly identify the columns as groupers and create the BaseGrouper accordingly. It should also handle grouping by column names when using the `axis=1` parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if key is None:
        key = group_axis

    if axis == 1 and isinstance(key, str):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)
    else:
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for i, gpr in enumerate(keys):
        groupings.append(
            Grouping(
                group_axis,
                gpr,
                name=gpr,
                sort=sort,
                observed=observed,
                in_axis=True,
            )
        )
        exclusions.append(gpr)

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This corrected code handles the grouping by column names when using `axis=1` and ensures that the BaseGrouper is created correctly. It should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
