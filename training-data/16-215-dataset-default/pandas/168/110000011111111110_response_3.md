    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers
    
    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers
    
    Groupers enable local references to axis,level,sort, while
    the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'
    
    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper
    
    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values
    
    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps

The corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function includes changes to handle the grouping by columns when the `axis` parameter is set to 1. The function now properly identifies the columns to be used for grouping and creates the groupings accordingly. This ensures that the function correctly groups the DataFrame by columns when the `axis` parameter is set to 1 as expected.

With the corrected code, the function will now handle the grouping by columns as intended, resolving the issue with the KeyError and ensuring that the grouping operation is performed correctly.
