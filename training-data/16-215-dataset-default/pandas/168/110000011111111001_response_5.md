The failing test `test_groupby_axis_1` is calling the `groupby` method of the `DataFrame` object with different values for the `axis` and `group_name` parameters. The test checks whether the result of the `groupby` operation matches the expected result. However, when the `group_name` is a list (`["x"]`), the code raises a `KeyError` within the `_get_grouper` function, indicating that there's an issue with the handling of the `group_name` when it's a list.

The issue appears to be related to the handling of the `group_name` parameter within the `_get_grouper` function. The function is attempting to process the `group_name` using conditions that are not designed for when `group_name` is a list.

To fix this bug, the `_get_grouper` function needs to be updated to properly handle the case where `group_name` is a list.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    if isinstance(key, (list, tuple)):
        keys = key
    else:
        keys = [key]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

With this correction, the `_get_grouper` function will properly handle the case where `key` is a list, and the `KeyError` should no longer occur.

After applying this correction, we should re-run the failing test to ensure that it now passes and that the function still satisfies the expected input/output variable information.
