Here's the full updated code for the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    if axis == 1:  # Check if grouping along columns
        if key is None:
            raise ValueError("No group keys passed for columns grouping")
        
        # Perform grouping along the columns based on the keys provided
        # For example, if key='x', group along the 'x' column
        groupings = []
        for col in key:
            groupings.append(Grouping(obj.columns, col, obj=obj, name=col))
        
        return BaseGrouper(obj.columns, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated), [], obj
    else:
        # Handle grouping along the index based on the key provided
        # (existing code for handling grouping along index)
        group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)
        # ... (rest of the existing code for handling grouping along the index)
```

This updated code includes a specific check for grouping along columns when the `axis` parameter is set to 1. If grouping along columns, it will create groupings based on the keys provided and return the BaseGrouper accordingly. Otherwise, it will proceed with the existing logic for handling grouping along the index. This fix should resolve the issue with grouping along columns as reported in the GitHub issue.
