The buggy function `_get_grouper` is a complex function that handles the creation of a `BaseGrouper` based on different input parameters. The error message indicates that the function is not handling the `group_name` parameter correctly, resulting in a `KeyError` when attempting to group the DataFrame.

The issue seems to be with the handling of the `group_name` parameter and its conversion into keys. The function is not correctly interpreting the `group_name` when it is passed as a list.

To fix the bug, the function's logic for handling `group_name` and converting it into keys needs to be revised. It should handle both single values and lists of values, ensuring that the correct keys are generated for grouping the DataFrame.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Existing function code...

    # Handle group_name parameter
    if key is None:
        key = group_name
    elif isinstance(key, list):
        # Case where group_name is passed as a list
        key = group_name
    else:
        # Case where group_name is a single value
        key = [group_name]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged...

```

With this modification, the function should correctly handle the `group_name` parameter whether it is passed as a single value or a list of values, thus resolving the `KeyError` when grouping the DataFrame.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue.
