The buggy function `_get_grouper` is used to create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal mapping of how to create the grouper indexers. The error occurs when trying to execute the test function `test_groupby_axis_1`, which is specifically for testing groupby functionality within the `groupby` method of a DataFrame.

The error message indicates a `KeyError` with the key being `'x'`. This error occurs within a series of checks and conversions in the `_get_grouper` function, where the key parameter is processed in various conditions. It seems that the function is not handling the column name correctly when passed as the key.

The possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
1. Ensuring that the handling of the column name as the key is done correctly, considering the condition where the key is a string and referring to a column name in the DataFrame's columns.
2. Adding additional checks or condition handling to ensure that the key, if it represents a column name, is processed appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if key in obj:
        key = obj[key]

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

The key fix in the corrected code is adding a check to see if the key exists in the DataFrame's columns and then obtaining it as the key for further processing if it does. Everything else in the function remains the same. This change ensures that the key parameter is correctly handled when it represents a column name in the DataFrame.
