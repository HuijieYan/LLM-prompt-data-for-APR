The bug in the provided function is likely due to the mishandling of the `key` parameter when it is passed as a list. The function is not correctly handling the case when the `key` parameter is a list of keys. This is leading to a `KeyError` when the function attempts to process the list of keys.

To fix this bug, the function `_get_grouper` needs to be modified to correctly handle the `key` parameter when it is a list.

One approach to fix the bug is to check if the `key` parameter is a list, and if so, perform the required operations for each key in the list.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Existing code remains unchanged

    if isinstance(key, list):
        groupings = []
        exclusions = []
        for k in key:
            grouper, exclusion, obj = _get_grouper(
                obj, key=k, axis=axis, level=level, sort=sort, observed=observed, mutated=mutated, validate=validate
            )
            groupings.append(grouper)
            exclusions.extend(exclusion)
        return BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated), exclusions, obj

    # Remaining code for handling the single key case
    # ...
```

By iterating over the list of keys and creating the requisite groupings for each key, this corrected function should now handle both single keys and lists of keys appropriately.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided for the failing test cases.
