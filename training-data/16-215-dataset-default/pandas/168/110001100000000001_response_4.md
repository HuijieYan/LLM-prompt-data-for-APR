1. The buggy function `_get_grouper` is responsible for creating and returning a `BaseGrouper`, which is an internal mapping of how to create the grouper indexers. The function tries to figure out what the passing in references are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into a BaseGrouper. It also contains some checks and validations related to the passed parameters.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the section where it checks for the type of `level` and performs different actions based on its type.

3. The cause of the bug might be related to the conditional blocks for handling the `level` parameter and its interaction with other parameters. The function may not be handling the different cases of `level` type properly, which could result in unexpected behavior or errors.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Review the conditional blocks related to the `level` parameter and ensure that they are handling all the different cases in a consistent and correct manner.
   - Consider refactoring the code to make it more concise and easier to maintain.
   - Add comments or documentation to clarify the intent of the code and the expected behavior in different scenarios.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
import warnings
from pandas.core.groupby.grouper import BaseGrouper, Grouping
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_hashable, is_scalar, is_list_like
from pandas.api.types import is_categorical_dtype
import numpy as np
from pandas import MultiIndex, Index, DataFrame, Series
import pandas.core.common as com


def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis,level,sort, while
    the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps
