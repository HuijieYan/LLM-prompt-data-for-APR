Upon analyzing the buggy function and its relationships with the related class, functions, test code, and error message, it is clear that the issue lies in the `_get_with` method of the `Series` class. The failing test is trying to index a Series using a key that does not exist in the Series index, and it is expecting a `KeyError` to be raised. However, the `_get_with` method is not handling this scenario properly, leading to the failure of the test.

The potential error location within the `_get_with` method is the handling of the index key when it does not exist in the Series index.

Suggested approaches for fixing the bug could be to modify the `_get_with` method to properly handle the case where the index key does not exist in the Series index. This may involve implementing a check for the existence of the key in the index before attempting to retrieve it from the Series data.

Here is the corrected code for the `_get_with` method:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if key in self.index:
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
```

This code first checks if the key exists in the index using the `in` operator, and if it does, returns the corresponding value using `loc`. If the key does not exist in the index, it raises a `KeyError` with an appropriate message.

This should fix the bug and make the `_get_with` method handle the scenario properly, allowing it to pass the failing test.
