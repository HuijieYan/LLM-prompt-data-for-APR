The issue arises from the inconsistency in how different types of indexers (list, array-like, and Index) are handled in the function. 

The cause of the bug is that the function is not treating the list indexer properly and is not returning the expected output for this case. This behavior is inconsistent with how other types of indexers are handled, which is highlighted in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the function should treat the list indexer in the same way as the other types of indexers. 

One possible approach to fix the bug is to update the code to handle the list indexer case in a consistent manner with the other indexers.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = "string"

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected code should handle the list indexer in the same manner as the other indexers, resolving the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue.
