Potential Error Location:
The potential error location within the problematic function is in the case when the key is being converted to a list using `list(key)`. This conversion may not be handling the input correctly, leading to the KeyError raised in the failing test.

Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of the key being converted to a list. When using a list as a key to index a Series, it is not being handled properly, leading to a KeyError being raised.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the code to ensure that when a key is converted to a list, it is handled correctly to avoid raising a KeyError.
2. Adjust the logic for how list-like keys are handled in the _get_with function to align with the behavior of other array-like indexers.

Corrected Code:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        # convert the key to a list and handle it accordingly
        key = list(key)
        return self.loc[key]
```

By updating the logic to convert the key to a list and then using the `loc` method, the corrected code should handle list-like keys correctly and pass the failing test. This should also align with the behavior of other array-like indexers.
