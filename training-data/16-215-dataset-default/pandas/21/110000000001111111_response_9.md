The issue here is that the function is not handling list indexers properly, resulting in a KeyError when trying to access the Series with a list as a key.

The problem occurs because the function is not treating a list as a valid key, and it raises an error when trying to access the Series using a list key.

To fix the issue, we need to adjust the function to treat a list key in the same way as other array-like indexers.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Treat list indexers the same as other array-like indexers
    return self.loc[key]
```

With this fix, the function will handle list indexers the same way as other array-like indexers, resolving the issue and aligning with the expected input/output variable information and the GitHub issue.
