1. The buggy function `_get_with` is a method of the `Series` class in the `pandas` library. It is responsible for handling different types of indexers (e.g. slice, DataFrame, tuple, list, etc.) and returning the appropriate values from the series. The function calls other methods of the same class such as `_slice`, `_get_values_tuple`, and `reindex`. 

The GitHub issue relates to the behavior of indexing a Series using a list index, where it raises a KeyError, while other types of indexers do not. This inconsistency in behavior needs to be addressed.

2. The potential error location within the `get_with` function is when it handles the case of a list indexer. This is evident from the GitHub issue description, which specifically mentions that indexing a Series with a list index resulted in a KeyError.

3. 
   (a). The buggy function `_get_with` does not handle the case of a list index properly, leading to the KeyError. 
   (b). The `Series` class contains the `_get_with` method as well as the other methods called within it.
   (c). The related functions `_slice`, `_get_values_tuple`, and `reindex` are called within `_get_with` for different types of indexers.
   (d). The GitHub issue provides clear examples of how the current behavior is inconsistent when using list indexers, and they propose that it should behave similar to other types of indexers.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Update the logic within the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers in a consistent manner with other indexers. This may involve adjusting the conditional statements or using a different approach to extract values from the Series.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ("integer", "list"):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected code, the handling of list indexers has been updated to be consistent with other indexers. If the key is a list or array, it will be passed to the `loc` method to retrieve values from the Series. This change ensures a consistent behavior for different types of indexers and resolves the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
