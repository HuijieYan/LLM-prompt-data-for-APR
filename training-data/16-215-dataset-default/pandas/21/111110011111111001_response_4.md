The issue with the buggy function seems to be related to the handling of the 'key_type' variable. It looks like the 'key_type' is being inferred as 'string' in all cases, which is incorrect and causing the function to return an incorrect value.

To fix this issue, we need to update the code related to inferring the 'key_type' based on the type of 'key' being passed to the function. Additionally, there seems to be a mix-up between the 'box' variable used in the test and the 'key' variable in the buggy function, which also needs to be addressed.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly infer the type of 'key' and handle the indexing accordingly, addressing the issues observed in the failing tests.

This corrected code should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
