1. The buggy function `_get_with` is part of the `Series` class in the `pandas/core/series.py` file. This function is responsible for handling indexing operations on a Series object. It calls functions like `_get_values_tuple`, `_slice`, and `reindex` to handle different types of indexable objects.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the conditional statements where the type of the `key` parameter is being checked. There may be issues with the logic of how different types of keys are being handled.

3. The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of different types of keys within the `_get_with` function. The conditional statements checking the type of `key` and the subsequent operations based on its type are likely where the issue lies.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Reviewing the conditional statements to ensure that each type of key is being handled correctly.
   - Checking for any inconsistencies in the type checking of `key`, and ensuring that the appropriate operations are being performed for each type.
   - Verifying that the functions called within the conditional statements are being used correctly.

5. Corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected code, the logic for handling different types of keys has been reviewed to ensure that each type is being handled correctly. The conditional statements and subsequent operations based on the type of `key` have been updated to fix the bug.
