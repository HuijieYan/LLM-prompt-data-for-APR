The bug in the _get_with function originates in the way list indexers are treated differently from array-like indexers. The failing test is triggered when using a list key, resulting in a KeyError because none of the elements are found in the index.

The _get_with function first checks for a slice, then a DataFrame, and then a tuple. If none of these conditions are met, it checks if the key is not list-like, and if so, it attempts to use self.loc[key]. This flow is flawed and does not handle the list key properly, leading to the KeyError.

To fix this bug, the _get_with function should be updated to handle list-like keys consistently with other types of keys and treat them the same way as array-like indexers. This will involve restructuring the conditional flow to handle all types of indexers in a consistent manner.

Here's the corrected code for the _get_with function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        raise TypeError("Unsupported indexer type")

```

This updated code ensures that all types of indexers are handled consistently and should pass the failing test. Additionally, it resolves the issue posted in the GitHub thread by making the behavior for all indexers consistent.
