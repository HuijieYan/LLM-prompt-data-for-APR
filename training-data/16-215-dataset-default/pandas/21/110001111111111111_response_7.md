The buggy function `_get_with` seems to be failing for different types of indexers (`list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, `pd.Series`) in the failing test. The function is not handling list-like indexers correctly, as evidenced by the error message where it states "None of [Index(['C'], dtype='object')] are in the [index]". This indicates that the function is not handling list indexers properly.

The function checks if the key is a list, and then tries to determine the key type, falling back to positional indexing if necessary. However, it seems to be treating the list indexers differently than other types of indexers. This inconsistency is causing the failing test.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle list-like indexers in the same way as other types of indexers. It should determine the key type and perform indexing accordingly. The function should treat all types of indexers consistently to avoid the failure.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This correction ensures that all types of indexers are handled consistently within the `_get_with` function. The function now determines the key type and performs indexing accordingly for all types of indexers, resolving the inconsistency.

This corrected code should address the failing tests, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
