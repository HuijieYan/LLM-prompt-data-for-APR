The bug in the function `_get_with` seems to be related to how different types of indexers are being handled. The code is treating list indexers differently from other types of indexers, which is leading to inconsistent behavior.

The issues arise when trying to use a list indexer, as it triggers a KeyError that is not consistent with the behavior observed with other types of indexers. This inconsistency is causing confusion and is noted in the GitHub issue.

The function needs to be fixed to handle list indexers in a consistent manner with the other types of indexers. This will involve adjusting the logic for list indexers to align with the behavior of other indexers, particularly the handling of string indexers.

A possible solution could involve updating the conditional statements in the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers in the same way as other types of indexers. This will help to ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list like indexers consistently
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ("integer", "boolean"):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected code should handle list indexers in a consistent manner with the other types of indexers, resolving the issue noted in the GitHub report.
