The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the handling of the `key` parameter when it is a list or ndarray. The function is not correctly identifying the type of key and handling it accordingly, leading to the failing tests.

The failing tests are trying to access a key that is not present in the series index, and they expect a `KeyError` to be raised. However, the function is not correctly identifying the type of the key and is failing to raise the `KeyError` as expected.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly identify the type of the key and handle it accordingly before performing any operations based on the type. Additionally, based on the failing tests, the function needs to raise a `KeyError` when the key is not present in the index.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    if isinstance(key, (pd.DataFrame, pd.Series)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or Series is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    if isinstance(key, tuple):
       return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, pd.Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    if any(k not in self.index for k in key):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected code, the function should correctly handle the different types of keys and raise a `KeyError` when the key is not present in the series index. This should make the failing tests pass and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
