1. The buggy function, `_get_with`, is responsible for handling different types of index inputs and returning the appropriate values. It calls other functions like `_slice`, `_get_values_tuple`, and `reindex` to handle specific cases based on the input type.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the block of code that handles the `key_type` and makes decisions based on the type of the key.

3. Bug Cause:
   (a). The buggy function tries to determine the type of the input key, but the handling of different key types and corresponding actions is not implemented correctly.
   (b). The related functions like `_slice`, `_get_values_tuple`, and `reindex` are called based on the type of the input key, but the decision-making process within the buggy function is flawed.

4. Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
   (a). Implement a more robust and accurate determination of the key type within the function.
   (b). Revise the decision-making process based on the key type to ensure the correct handling of different key types.
   (c). Ensure that the appropriate functions like `_slice`, `_get_values_tuple`, `reindex`, `loc`, and `iloc` are called based on the type of the input key.

5. Corrected Code:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
        #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        elif isinstance(key, list):
            # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
            return self.loc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)

    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    else:  # handling for scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
```
In the corrected code, the handling of different key types is revised to ensure accurate determination of the key type and appropriate actions based on the type. The decision-making process is improved to correctly call the relevant functions based on the input key. Additionally, the error handling for DataFrame inputs and scalars is also included.
