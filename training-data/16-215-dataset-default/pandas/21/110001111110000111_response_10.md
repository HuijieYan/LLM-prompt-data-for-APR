The buggy function `_get_with` is used for indexing a Series with a variety of input types such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, single values, lists, np.arrays, pd.Index, and pd.Series. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is testing the behavior of the function when provided with different input types.

The error message indicates that the function is not raising a `KeyError` as expected when indexing with a list. This inconsistency in behavior between different input types is the cause of the bug.

The GitHub issue title "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]" highlights the inconsistency in behavior related to different input types and suggests that the behavior of indexing with a list is different from array-like indexers.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` needs to be modified to ensure consistent behavior for different input types such as lists, np.arrays, pd.Index, and pd.Series.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the logic for handling input types within the `_get_with` function to ensure consistent behavior. This may involve updating the conditional statements and error handling to handle different input types in a uniform manner.

The corrected code for the problematic function `_get_with` is as follows:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    # handle the case of list indexing
    if isinstance(key, list):
        key_type = "list"
    elif isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected code, we have added specific handling for list indexing and ensured consistent behavior across different input types. This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
