The issue is that in the _get_with function, the key_type is not always being properly identified. It is expected that the key_type is identified using the inferred type of the key; however, in the failing tests, the key_type is always being incorrectly identified as 'string'.

This could be due to the conditions not properly evaluating the type of the key and not correctly inferring the key_type. To fix this, we need to check the key's type and infer the key_type based on its type.

Here is the corrected code for the _get_with function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type in ["string", "integer"]:
            if key_type == "integer" and not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)

    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
    return self.loc[key]
```

The updated code should now correctly identify the key_type based on the input key and infer_dtype. This should fix the failing tests where the key_type is expected to be inferred as 'string' and 'integer' based on the type of the input key.
