The buggy function is supposed to handle different types of input keys and return specific values based on the type of the key. However, the way it is handled causes the failing test to raise a KeyError.

The potential cause of the bug can be identified as the incorrect handling of the key types. The function tries to handle key types using various conditions, but these conditions are not properly structured.

To fix the bug, the conditions for handling different key types need to be properly organized. Instead of using multiple if-else conditions for each type of key, a more systematic approach such as using if-elif-else ladder can be implemented to handle each type of key separately.

The corrected code for the `_get_with` function is provided below:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected code provides a more organized and systematic approach to handling different types of keys. It ensures that the appropriate action is taken based on the type of the input key, which should resolve the KeyError raised in the failing test.
