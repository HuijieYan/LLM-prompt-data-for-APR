Analysis:
The issue seems to arise from the way list indexers are handled differently from array-like indexers in the `_get_with` function. The failing test indicates that when using a list indexer, a KeyError is raised, while it behaves differently for array-like indexers.

Additionally, the variable `key_type` is being inferred as `'string'` for all cases, which indicates that the logic for determining the type of the key is not functioning correctly.

The GitHub issue mentions that the behavior is inconsistent and proposes making all indexers behave like the list case. It also notes that `ser.loc[key]` raises for all cases, indicating a discrepancy in behavior between indexers.

Bug Cause:
The issue seems to stem from the inconsistent handling of different types of indexers and the incorrect inference of the key type.

Potential Fix:
One approach to fixing the bug would be to standardize the handling of different types of indexers so that they all behave similarly. Additionally, the logic for inferring the key type needs to be corrected to accurately determine the type of the key.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Corrected logic for inferring key type
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key_type = None
    elif isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray) or isinstance(key, ExtensionArray) or isinstance(key, Series):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```
This corrected code standardizes the handling of different types of indexers and includes corrected logic for inferring the key type.

By making these changes, the `ser[key]` operation should behave consistently for all types of indexers and pass the failing test. Additionally, it aligns with the expected input/output variable information provided and resolves the issue mentioned in the GitHub post.
