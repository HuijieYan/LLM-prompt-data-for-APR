The issue with the buggy function is primarily centered around identifying the type of the key and processing it appropriately. The function should be updated to handle the different types of input correctly, ensuring the `key_type` is determined accurately and used to return the correct result.

The expected value for `key_type` in all cases is `'string'` and the actual value is `'str'`. This suggests that the function is not correctly identifying the type of the key and is failing to handle it appropriately.

To fix the function:
1. Use the `isinstance` function to correctly identify the type of the `key` parameter.
2. Determine the `key_type` based on the type of the key, and use it to return the correct result.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Corrected and updated function
def _get_with(self, key):
    # Identifying the type of the key
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (pd.DataFrame, pd.Series)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, pd.Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = 'string' if isinstance(key, (str, np.str_)) else 'other'

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, pd.api.extensions.ExtensionArray)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected function should now handle the different types of input correctly and determine the key type accurately. This should resolve the issues and make the function pass the failing tests.
