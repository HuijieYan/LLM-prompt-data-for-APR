The issue arises from the inconsistency in the behavior of the `Series` class when using different types of indexers, specifically when using a list as an indexer. The behavior is inconsistent with using other types of indexers such as `Index`, `np.array`, or `pd.Series`.

The bug is located in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. The code inconsistently handles different types of indexers, leading to unexpected behavior and errors when using a list as an indexer.

The root cause of the bug can be traced to the inconsistent handling of different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function. This inconsistency results in errors and unexpected behavior when using a list as an indexer. The GitHub issue highlights this inconsistency and suggests that the behavior of using a list as an indexer should be consistent with other types of indexers.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to be modified to handle list indexers in a consistent manner with other types of indexers. This can be achieved by ensuring that the behavior of using a list as an indexer aligns with the behavior of using other types of indexers, such as `Index`, `np.array`, or `pd.Series`.

The corrected code for the `_get_with` function is as follows:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, pd.DataFrame)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected code, the `_get_with` function now consistently handles different types of indexers, including lists, and aligns with the expected behavior outlined in the GitHub issue. This should resolve the inconsistency and errors associated with using list indexers in the `Series` class.
