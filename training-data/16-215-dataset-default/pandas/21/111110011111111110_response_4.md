The issue in the code appears to be with how list indexers are treated differently from array-like indexers, resulting in inconsistent behavior. To fix this issue, the _get_with function can be corrected as follows:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, pd.Index, pd.Series)):
        key = list(key)

        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

It's important to ensure that list, np.ndarray, pd.Index, and pd.Series indexers are treated consistently to avoid the KeyError issue and provide the expected behavior in all cases. After implementing this fix, the failing tests should pass and the inconsistent behavior issue should be resolved. This updated code should address the reported bug and provide consistent behavior across different types of indexers.
