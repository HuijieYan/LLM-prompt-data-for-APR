The potential problem in the code is related to the condition 

```python
elif not is_list_like(key):
    # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
```

The issue is with the condition `not is_list_like(key)` and the subsequent return statement. It seems that the condition is incorrectly checking if `key` is not list-like, and then trying to access it as if it were a valid indexable object.

One way to fix this bug is to modify the condition to check if `key` is not list-like and then raise an error or handle it appropriately.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# This is the corrected function
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        raise TypeError("Unsupported key type")

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding the error handling code for non-list-like keys, we ensure that unsupported key types are caught and an appropriate error is raised. This should fix the issue and make the function more robust.
