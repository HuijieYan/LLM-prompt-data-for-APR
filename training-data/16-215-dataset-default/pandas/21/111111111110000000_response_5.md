The bug in the _get_with function is that it does not handle the case when the key is not present in the index correctly. Here's the corrected version of the _get_with function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    try:
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
            #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        else:
            return self.loc[key]
    except KeyError:
        raise KeyError("None of {} are in the index".format(key))
```

The function now catches the KeyError and raises a new KeyError with a more specific message, indicating that none of the given keys are present in the index. This should resolve the failing tests.
