The bug seems to be related to how the function `_get_with` handles different types of indexers like list, array, index, and series, leading to inconsistent behavior and KeyError in certain cases.

The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is designed to test the behavior of the function when an index that doesn't exist in the series is passed as the key.

The error message indicates that the function is failing to raise a KeyError as expected.

The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in the behavior of the function when dealing with different types of indexers and suggests that the behavior should be consistent across all cases.

To fix the bug, an approach could be to ensure that the function `_get_with` handles all types of indexers consistently and raises a KeyError when the index doesn't exist.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, pd.Index, pd.Series)):
        key = pd.Index(key)

    if not self.index.isin(key).all():
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    return self.loc[key]
```

The updated code checks if the key is list-like, array-like, or a Series, and converts it to a pandas Index. Then, it checks if all the elements of the key exist in the index, and if not, it raises a KeyError. Finally, it returns the result of accessing the Series using the key.

This approach ensures consistent behavior for all types of indexers and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
