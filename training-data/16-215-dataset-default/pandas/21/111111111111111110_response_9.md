The issue in the provided function is that the `list` indexer is not being handled properly compared to other types of indexers. To fix this, we can update the `_get_with` function to handle the `list` indexer in the same way as other indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version will handle the `list` indexer in the same way as other indexers, ensuring consistency in behavior. It should address the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported.
