The problem seems to be occurring when the `ser[key]` line is executed in the test function. The error message indicates that a KeyError was expected, but it did not occur.

The potential error location within the problematic function is when the key is converted using the `box` parameter, which could be causing an issue in the indexing process.

The cause of the bug is likely due to incorrect handling of the key parameter when it is being converted using different types specified by the `box` parameter.

To fix the bug, we can try to modify the `_get_with` function to handle the `key` parameter correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, pd.Index, pd.Series)):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the `key` is an instance of types that can be directly used for indexing (like list, np.ndarray, pd.Index, pd.Series). If it is, we use `loc` to perform the indexing operation. Otherwise, we go through the other conditional checks as before.

This corrected code should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
