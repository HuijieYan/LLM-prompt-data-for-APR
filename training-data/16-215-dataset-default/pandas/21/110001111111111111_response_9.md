The problem with the buggy function is that it is treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior. This inconsistency is causing the failing test because the function raises a KeyError for list indexers, but not for other types of indexers.

To fix this bug, the function `_get_with` needs to treat all types of indexers consistently. It should raise a KeyError for all indexers that don't match any values in the index. 

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected code treats all types of indexers consistently and should resolve the inconsistency issue.

This fix should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. It also resolves the issue posted in the GitHub report, where the behavior of list indexers was inconsistent with other types of indexers.
