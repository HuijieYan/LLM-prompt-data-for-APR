The buggy function `_get_with` is not correctly handling the case when the key is a list. The function is trying to access the `loc` attribute of the series using the list key, which is leading to a KeyError. This is causing the failing test cases.

The related function `ser[key]` should behave consistently regardless of whether key is a list, array, index, or series. However, currently, `ser[list(key)]` is raising a KeyError, while the other cases are not.

The failing test is checking for this inconsistent behavior and is expecting a KeyError when using a list as the key.

The pytest error message indicates that the test failed because the function did not raise a KeyError, as expected.

The expected and actual input/output variable information shows that the key type is being incorrectly identified as a string, when it should have been identified as a list.

The GitHub issue describes the inconsistency in behavior when using a list as a key for indexing a series and questions if there is a compelling reason for this inconsistency.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to handle the case when the key is a list in the same way it handles other cases, such as array, index, or series, to ensure consistent behavior.

The corrected code for the `_get_with` function is provided below:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the `_get_with` function will handle the list key case properly, ensuring consistent behavior for all types of keys. The function will now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information, resolving the inconsistency described in the GitHub issue.
