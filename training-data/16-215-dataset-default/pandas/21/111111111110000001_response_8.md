The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is meant to handle various types of keys and return the corresponding values. The failing test functions are testing the behavior of the function when it is called with different types of keys, such as lists, arrays, indexes, and series. The error message indicates that the function is not raising a `KeyError` as expected, which suggests that it is not handling the keys correctly.

Upon analyzing the function, it appears that the issue lies in the condition where it checks whether the key is a list-like object. The function then goes on to convert the key to a list, which may not be the correct behavior and could lead to unexpected results.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to refactor the condition for list-like keys and handle the different types of keys separately. For example, if the key is an index, it should be treated differently than if it is a list or another type of key.

Another approach could be to add explicit type checks for different types of keys and handle them accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Index)):
        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version of the function handles different types of keys appropriately, and it should pass the failing test cases provided.
