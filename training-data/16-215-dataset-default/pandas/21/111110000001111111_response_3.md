The issue lies in the handling of list indexers within the `_get_with` function of the Series class. When a list indexer is passed, the function does not correctly handle the case where there are no matches in the index, leading to a KeyError.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle list indexers in the same way it handles other indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior. This is also reflected in the GitHub issue, where the behavior of list indexers is noted to be different from array-like indexers.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to handle list indexers in the same way it handles other indexers, ensuring consistent behavior and preventing KeyError. 

The corrected code for the `_get_with` function is as follows:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list indexers in the same way as other indexers
    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            return self.reindex(key)

    # Default behavior for other indexers
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected code handles list indexers in the same way as other indexers, ensuring consistent behavior and preventing KeyError. It aligns with the expected input/output variable information provided and resolves the issue posted in the GitHub report.
