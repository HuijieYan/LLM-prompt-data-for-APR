Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of indexers and determining whether to treat them as positional or label-based. The GitHub issue describes the inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers, specifically highlighting the discrepancy when using `list(key)`. 

Potential Error:
The potential error seems to be in the portion of the code that handles the `list` indexer, as the inconsistent behavior is observed when using `ser[list(key)]` and `ser.loc[key]`.

Bug's Cause:
The bug is caused by the inconsistent handling of the `list` indexer compared to other array-like indexers. This causes discrepancies in the behavior based on the type of indexer used, leading to unexpected errors and results.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Standardizing the behavior of the `list` indexer to align with the behavior of other array-like indexers.
2. Ensuring that the handling of different indexers is consistent throughout the function.

Corrected Code:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # Standardize the behavior for list indexer
        key = list(key)
        return self.reindex(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```
The corrected code ensures that the behavior of the `list` indexer is standardized and aligned with the behavior of other array-like indexers. This addresses the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue and provides a more cohesive handling of different types of indexers.
