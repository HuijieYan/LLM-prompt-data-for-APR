### Bug's Cause:
The bug occurs due to the `_get_with` function's incorrect implementation. The function is trying to handle different types of input data (`key`) such as slice, dataframe, tuple, etc., and based on the type of key, it's trying to perform specific operations. However, the implementation has issues in identifying and handling the types of different inputs, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Potential Error Location:
The potential error is caused by the handling of different types of inputs for the `key` parameter in the `_get_with` function.

### Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
We need to update the function to accurately identify and handle different types of input `key` parameters. We should also ensure that the function returns the expected value and type of variables based on the inputs given in the failing test cases.

### Code Correction:
```python
# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, pd.Series, pd.Index)):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, pd.Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `_get_with` function with the corrected logic, it should be able to handle different types of input `key` parameters and return the expected value and type of variables for the failing test cases.
