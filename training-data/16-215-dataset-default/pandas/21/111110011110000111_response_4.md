The buggy function is part of the Series class in the pandas library. The function, _get_with, is designed to handle different types of indexers for a Series object. It checks the type of the key and performs different operations based on its type.

The error seems to be related to how the function handles a list indexer. The failing test is checking the behavior when a list indexer is used, and it is expecting a KeyError to be raised. However, the current implementation does not raise a KeyError when a list indexer is used, leading to test failures.

The GitHub issue titled "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]" provides more details about the inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers, specifically highlighting the issue with list indexers.

To fix the bug, the function _get_with needs to be updated to handle list indexers in a consistent manner with other types of indexers. The correction should align the behavior of list indexers with the behavior of other indexers, ensuring that a KeyError is raised when there are no matches in the index.

Here's the corrected code for the _get_with function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index) or isinstance(key, pd.Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, pd.Index):
        return self.loc[key]

    raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
```

This corrected code ensures that when a list indexer is used, a KeyError is raised if there are no matches in the index. This change aligns the behavior of list indexers with other types of indexers and resolves the issue reported in the GitHub post.
