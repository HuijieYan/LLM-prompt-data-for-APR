The bug is caused by the inconsistent behavior of different indexers when used with the Series class, leading to different outcomes and error messages.

The problem appears to be within the `_get_with` function, specifically in the section where the key is not recognized as a list-like object and is then converted to a list. This causes inconsistency in behavior when accessing the Series, leading to error messages when certain indexers are used.

To fix the bug, the section of the function that converts the key to a list when it's not recognized as list-like needs to be modified. Instead of converting the key to a list, it should use the key directly for indexing into the Series.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        # Use the key directly
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected code should address the inconsistency in behavior and correctly handle different types of indexers when used with the `Series` class.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. It should also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub discussion by providing consistent behavior for different types of indexers.
