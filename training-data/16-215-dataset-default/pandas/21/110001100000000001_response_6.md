The potential error in the buggy function lies in the section of code where it checks for the data type of the 'key' parameter and how it handles different data types. The function tries to handle different types of 'key' inputs, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, and arrays, but the logic for handling these different types is not properly structured.

The buggy function calls the `_slice` and `_get_values_tuple` functions to handle slices and tuples, but the logic to handle the other types of 'key' inputs is convoluted and unclear. It tries to handle different cases for integers, booleans, and lists but lacks a clear and structured approach to handle these cases.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to refactor the logic for handling different data types of the 'key' parameter. The logic should be made more structured and clear, with separate conditional blocks for different data types. This will make the function more readable and maintainable.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.reindex(key)
    elif isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (int, np.integer)):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        raise TypeError("Unsupported key type")
```

In the corrected code, the logic for handling different data types of the 'key' parameter is more structured and clear. Each data type is handled in a separate conditional block, making the code more readable and maintainable. This should fix the bug and improve the overall reliability of the function.
