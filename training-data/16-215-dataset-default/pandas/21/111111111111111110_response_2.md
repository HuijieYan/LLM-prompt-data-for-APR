The issue with the given buggy function is that it treats the list indexer differently from other array-like indexers. To fix this issue, we need to modify the `_get_with` function as follows:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, pd.Index, pd.Series)):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This modification ensures that all array-like indexers are treated in the same way, which aligns with the expected behavior described in the failing test cases and the GitHub issue.

After making this change, the function should return the expected results for the provided failing test cases. Additionally, the modified function addresses the inconsistency in how different types of indexers are handled, as highlighted in the GitHub issue description.
