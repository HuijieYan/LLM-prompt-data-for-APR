### Bug's cause:

The bug occurs when the function is trying to determine the type of the `key`. The function checks if the `key` is a slice, a DataFrame, or a tuple, and then attempts to infer the type using other checks. However, there are discrepancies in the checks for the type of the `key` and the inferred type, leading to incorrect determinations.

### Possible fixes:

1. Add an explicit check for the type of the `key` using `isinstance()` and avoid inferring the type based on other assumptions.
2. Ensure that all possible data types of the `key` are handled correctly and consistently.

### Corrected code:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, str) or isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray) or isinstance(key, pd.Index):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```
This code directly checks the type of the `key` and uses the `loc` or `reindex` methods accordingly, taking into consideration the expected input/output variable information provided.
