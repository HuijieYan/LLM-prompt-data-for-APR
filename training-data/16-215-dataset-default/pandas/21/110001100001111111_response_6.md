The issue here is that the function `_get_with` does not handle the case where the key used for indexing is a list. It only checks for slices, dataframes, tuples, and individual elements but not for lists.

The GitHub issue indicates that the behavior for accessing a Series with a list indexer is inconsistent and raises a KeyError. The goal is to make all indexers behave like the list case.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should be modified to handle the case where the key is a list.

Here is the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif hasattr(key, 'dtype') and hasattr(key.dtype, 'type') and np.issubdtype(key.dtype.type, np.integer):
        return self.iloc[key]
    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```
In this corrected code:
- We have added a check using `is_list_like(key)` to handle the case where the key is a list.
- We have used `hasattr(key, 'dtype')` and `hasattr(key.dtype, 'type')` to ensure that the key has a dtype attribute and its dtype has a type attribute, and then used `np.issubdtype` to check if the key is of integer type. This is to handle the case where the key is an array of integers.

This corrected code should now handle all the input cases provided and satisfy the expected output for each case. Additionally, it should address the issue reported in the GitHub issue by making the behavior consistent for all indexers.
