The buggy function is the `_get_with` method within the `Series` class. The failing test is testing for behavior when indexing a Series with a key that has no matches in the index. The error message indicates that the KeyError is not being raised as expected.

The issue appears to be with the handling of list indexers differently from other array-like indexers. When a list key is used to index the Series, it raises a KeyError, while other array-like indexers do not.

The cause of the bug seems to be the inconsistency in the behavior of different types of indexers. The github issue confirms this discrepancy and questions the rationale behind the different behavior.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` method needs to be modified to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers. This would involve handling list indexers in a manner similar to other array-like indexers.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # handle list-like key
    return self.reindex(key)
```
With this correction, the function should now behave consistently for all types of indexers and pass the failing test. It also resolves the issue posted in the GitHub report.
