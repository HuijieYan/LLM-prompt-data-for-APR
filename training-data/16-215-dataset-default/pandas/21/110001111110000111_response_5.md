The bug seems to be related to how list indexers are handled differently from array-like indexers in the _get_with function of the Series class. In the failing test, when using a list as an indexer, it raises a KeyError, while using other array-like indexers does not. This behavior is inconsistent and not in line with expectations, as indicated in the GitHub issue.

The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be in the part where list-like keys are being handled. It appears that there is a discrepancy in the handling of list indexers compared to other array-like indexers.

The issue could be caused by a conditional clause that differentiates between list and array-like indexers, which leads to different outcomes.

To fix the bug, one possible approach would be to review the conditional clauses that differentiate between different types of indexers in the _get_with function and make them consistent. This could involve changing the logic to handle list indexers in a similar way to how other array-like indexers are handled.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

With this corrected code, the failing test should pass, and the behavior for list indexers should be consistent with other array-like indexers. This should also address the issue reported in the GitHub post.
