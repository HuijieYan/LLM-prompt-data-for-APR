The issue with the `_get_with` function is that it does not handle the key correctly. In all the failing test cases, the key is being treated as a list when it is not. Since the key is a single value, it should be treated as a scalar instead.

Based on the failing tests and the runtime values and types of the variables, it is clear that the function is not correctly identifying the type of the key, which is leading to a KeyError during testing. The key should be treated as a scalar value in this case, but the function treats it as a list or ndarray.

To fix this, the function needs to be modified to correctly identify the type of the key and handle it accordingly. It should recognize scalar values and handle them separately from lists or ndarrays. Additionally, it should avoid converting scalar values into lists as this causes the function to behave incorrectly.

Below is the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)
    else:
        key = [key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected function should now correctly handle scalar key values, lists, and ndarrays, and it should pass the failing tests while satisfying the expected input/output variable information provided.
