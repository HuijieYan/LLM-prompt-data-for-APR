1. The problematic function is a method called **_get_with** within the Series class. This method is responsible for handling different types of keys and extracting data based on those keys.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of different key types and the decision-making process for whether to use positional or label-based indexing.

3. The bug's cause is due to inconsistencies and potential incorrect handling of different key types, the decision-making process for indexing, and the possibility of not returning the correct data based on the key type. This can lead to incorrect data extraction or errors during the indexing process.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include ensuring proper handling of different key types, implementing a clear decision-making process for choosing between positional and label-based indexing, and making sure that the correct data is returned based on the key type.

5. Corrected code:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "mixed-integer"]:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected code, the key_type checking has been updated to handle "mixed-integer" type as well. Additionally, the decision on using positional or label-based indexing has been revised for "integer" and "mixed-integer" types. This should address the potential issues and provide a more robust behavior for indexing.
