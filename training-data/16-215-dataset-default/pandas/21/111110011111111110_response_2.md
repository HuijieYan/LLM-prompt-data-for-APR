The issue with the `_get_with` function is that it does not handle the case of a list-like key correctly. It treats list indexers differently from other array-like indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior. To fix this issue, we need to revise the `_get_with` function to handle the list-like key in the same way as other array-like indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # Treat all array-like indexers in the same way
    key = list(key)
    return self.loc[key]
```

With this correction, the function will now treat list-like indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers, ensuring consistent behavior for all cases.

After applying this fix, the failing test cases should pass, and the function should behave as expected for list, ndarray, Index, and Series indexers. This will address the inconsistency in behavior and ensure that the function handles all array-like indexers correctly.
