The problem arises from the way the function handles different types of input arrays for key (array, list, Index, Series), resulting in inconsistent behavior. In particular, the function raises a KeyError when the key is a list, but not when it is an array, Index, or Series. This results in an inconsistency in how different array types are handled by the function, causing the failing test to throw a KeyError.

The root cause of the bug is the inconsistent handling of different types of input arrays for the key, leading to an incorrect Key error being raised for some types of arrays.

To fix the bug, the function should handle different types of input arrays for the key consistently, ensuring that the behavior is the same regardless of the type of array used as the key.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to modify the function's logic to handle all types of input arrays (array, list, Index, Series) in a consistent manner, ensuring that the behavior is uniform across all types.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    # Convert key to a list if it's not already list-like
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)
        
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected function now handles all types of input arrays (array, list, Index, Series) in a consistent manner, ensuring uniform behavior regardless of the type of array used as the key. This corrected function should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and successfully resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
