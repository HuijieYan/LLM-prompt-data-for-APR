The issue with the buggy function seems to be with the logic around handling different types of keys. The function checks the type of the key and follows different logic paths accordingly, but the type checking and handling appears to be incorrect.

The failing tests are trying to access a key that does not exist in the index, and the function is not raising the expected KeyError.

To fix the bug, we can simplify the logic for handling different key types and instead focus on correctly accessing the key from the index and raising a KeyError if it does not exist.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # If key is list-like, try to access the elements from the index
    try:
        return self.loc[key]
    except KeyError:
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
```

With this correction, the function should correctly handle different types of keys and raise a KeyError if the key does not exist in the index. This will resolve the failing tests and ensure that the function behaves as expected in the different scenarios provided.
