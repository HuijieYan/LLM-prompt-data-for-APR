The issue originates from the mismatched behavior of different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function, as evidenced by the failing test. The test fails because the function does not handle the case where a list indexer is used to access a value that does not exist in the Series index.

The potential error location within the function is the handling of the list indexer case, as it raises a KeyError when the specified key is not found in the Series index.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the case where a list indexer is used to access a value that does not exist in the Series index. This inconsistency in behavior is highlighted in the failing test and the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle the list indexer case in the same way it handles other array-like indexers, ensuring consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected code now handles the list indexer case in the same way it handles other array-like indexers, ensuring consistent behavior. It should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. Additionally, it resolves the issue posted in the GitHub report.
