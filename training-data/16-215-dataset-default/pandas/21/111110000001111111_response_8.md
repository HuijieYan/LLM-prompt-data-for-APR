The bug seems to be occurring due to inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series with different types of indexers. Specifically, when using a list as an indexer, it is not being handled properly, resulting in a KeyError.

From the information provided, it seems that the issue lies within the `_get_with` function, specifically in the section that handles the cases where the key is not a slice, a DataFrame, or a tuple.

The discrepancy between the expected and actual input/output variable values is seen in the runtime values of the key_type variable. In the expected cases, the key_type is expected to be `'string'`, but in the actual cases, it is being set to `'integer'`.

The GitHub issue further highlights the inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers and points out that the behavior is not as expected.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to modify the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers correctly. The function should consistently handle different types of indexers and ensure that the behavior is as expected.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        if key.dtype == np.bool_:
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected code will ensure that different types of indexers are handled consistently and address the issue reported in the GitHub problem statement.
