The issue is related to the way list indexers are handled differently from array-like indexers in the buggy function `_get_with`, which is part of the `Series` class. When using a list indexer, the function raises a KeyError, while for other types of indexers, it returns NaN values. This behavior inconsistency is causing the failing test.

The buggy function is `_get_with` within the `Series` class. It's related to the `reindex` and `_get_values_tuple` functions, as well as the test function `test_getitem_no_matches` that is failing.

The error occurs because the `_get_with` function treats list indexers differently from other indexers, leading to a KeyError. This is inconsistent with how other indexers are handled, causing the failing test.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should handle list indexers in a similar way to how it handles other indexers. By making all indexers behave consistently, the KeyError can be avoided and the failing test can be passed.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function `_get_with` that resolves the issue:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index) or not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected code, the failing test should pass, and the issue reported in the GitHub bug can be resolved.
