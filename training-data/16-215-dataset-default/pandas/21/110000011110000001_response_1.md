The problematic function is designed to handle different types of inputs for key and return the corresponding value. The failing test is checking whether the function raises a KeyError when given an input key that does not exist in the Series.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `if not is_list_like(key)` condition. The code is trying to access the `loc` attribute of the uninitialized index. This is most likely causing the KeyError not to be raised as expected in the failing test.

The bug's cause can be attributed to the code not correctly handling the case when `is_list_like(key)` is False.

To fix the bug, the code needs to explicitly handle the case when `is_list_like(key)` is False.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        # handle the case when is_list_like(key) is False
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle the case when `is_list_like(key)` is False and the failing test should pass.
