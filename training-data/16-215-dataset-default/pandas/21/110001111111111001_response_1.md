The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to the handling of the `key` variable and its type. The code is trying to determine the type of the `key` and then make decisions based on its type, but there seems to be some issues with this logic.

The failing test is related to the `_get_with` function's behavior when indexing with a key that is not present in the series index. The error message indicates that the function is not raising a `KeyError` as expected.

The discrepancies between the expected and actual input/output variable values indicate that the `key_type` variable is always being assigned the value of `'string'`, regardless of the type of the `key` variable.

To fix the bug, the logic for determining the type of the `key` variable needs to be revised. Additionally, the logic for handling different types of keys needs to be reviewed to ensure that the correct actions are taken for each type of key.

The corrected code for the `_get_with` function is as follows:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (pd.DataFrame, pd.Series)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or another Series is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
```

This corrected code handles different types of keys properly and ensures that a `KeyError` is raised when the key is not present in the series index. The function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
