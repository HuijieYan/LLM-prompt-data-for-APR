The issue originates from the `_get_with` function, as it is failing to handle list-like indexers correctly, resulting in inconsistent behavior compared to array-like and index-like indexers.

The problem seems to stem from the section of the code where the `KeyError` is raised. The function is not treating the list indexers the same as array-like indexers, which results in an inconsistent behavior.

The GitHub issue suggests that there should not be a compelling reason for this inconsistency, and the behavior of list indexers should be aligned with array-like indexers. It also references a specific test that broke when attempting to make all cases behave like the list case.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to be modified to handle list-like indexers in the same way as array-like indexers. This will align the behavior with the expectations and resolve the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    return self.loc[key]
```

With this correction, the `_get_with` function should handle list-like indexers in the same way as array-like indexers, resolving the inconsistency. Additionally, it should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. This corrected code should also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub thread.
