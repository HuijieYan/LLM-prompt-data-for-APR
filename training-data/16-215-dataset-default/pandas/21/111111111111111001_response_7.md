The problem with the buggy function lies in the type checking and handling of the `key` variable, which should be treated as a string. Additionally, the bug arises because of type inference errors and handling of the key variable, as indicated by the change in types from ndarray to Index. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the type checking and handling of the key variable within the `_get_with` function. We should ensure that the key is treated as a string before proceeding with further operations.

A possible approach for fixing the bug would be to modify the conditional logic in the `_get_with` function to handle the key type properly. Specifically, we need to ensure that regardless of the input type, the key is treated as a string.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # Ensure key is treated as a string regardless of input type
    key = str(key)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected code, the function should now properly handle the input key variable and satisfy all the specified test cases.
