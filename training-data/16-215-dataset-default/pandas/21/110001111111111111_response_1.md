The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of input `key`, such as slice, DataFrame, tuple, and others, and return the corresponding output based on the input type.

The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is testing how Series behaves when indexed with a key that does not match any of its elements. The test tries to index a Series with a key that does not exist in the Series and expects a KeyError to be raised.

The expected input/output variable information provided in the failing test shows that the key in all cases is 'C', which does not exist in the Series.

The GitHub issue title and detailed description illustrate that there is inconsistency in how Series behaves when indexed with different types of keys, and the expectation is for all cases to behave similarly. The issue also mentions that the test was added in a previous pull request and that it's causing inconsistent behavior.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of the 'list' type key. The current implementation of the function for handling a 'list' type key is causing a KeyError to be raised when the list key does not exist in the Series, which is inconsistent with the behavior of other key types.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` needs to be modified in such a way that the behavior for the 'list' type key is consistent with the behavior for other key types. The correction should ensure that a KeyError is not raised when indexing with a 'list' key that does not exist in the Series, similar to the behavior for other key types.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `_get_with`:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check if key is list-like or a scalar that isn't recognized by lib.is_scalar
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle the case where key is not a list or ndarray
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = [key]

    # Handle indexing with a list to be consistent with other key types
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected code ensures that the behavior for indexing with a 'list' type key is consistent with other key types, and it avoids raising a KeyError when the key does not exist in the Series. This corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. Additionally, it should resolve the inconsistency issue mentioned in the GitHub issue.
