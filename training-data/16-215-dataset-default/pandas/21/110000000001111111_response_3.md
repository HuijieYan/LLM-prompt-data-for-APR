1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle various types of indexers for a Pandas Series. The GitHub issue title "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]" indicates the problem occurs when using a list indexer that doesn't match any values in the Series.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the initial check for list-like indexers and the subsequent processing of the index. It seems that the function is not handling the list indexers correctly.

3. The bug may be caused by the function incorrectly handling list indexers compared to other types of indexers. This discrepancy is noticeable in the GitHub issue, where the list indexer raises an error while the other indexers do not.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Ensure consistent behavior for different types of indexers.
   - Check for the presence of items from the provided indexer in the Series before attempting to access them.
   - Handle the case where the indexer does not match any values in the Series.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
        
    if isinstance(key, list) and not set(key).issubset(set(self.index)):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected function includes additional checks to handle the case where the provided list indexer does not match any values in the Series. It ensures consistent behavior for different types of indexers and resolves the issue posted in the GitHub report.
