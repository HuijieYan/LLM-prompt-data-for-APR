1. Analyzing the provided information, it is clear that there is an inconsistency in how the function `_get_with` handles different types of indexers, leading to the `KeyError` when using a list as an indexer in the `ser[key]` expression.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of list-like indexers.

3. The bug is caused by the inconsistent handling of different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function. The function does not handle list-like indexers properly, leading to a `KeyError` when using a list as an indexer in the `ser[key]` expression. This inconsistency has been documented in the GitHub issue.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include ensuring consistent handling of different types of indexers within the `_get_with` function and updating the logic to properly handle list-like indexers to avoid the `KeyError`. Additionally, the function should align with the expected behavior and error message captured in the failing test and GitHub issue.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (slice, np.ndarray, pd.Index, pd.Series)):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected code, the `_get_with` function now properly handles different types of indexers. It first checks for the specific types that should be handled using `self.loc[key]` and then falls back to the other cases including tuples and any other type for which reindexing is necessary. This corrected code aims to pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
