The issue here is that the function `_get_with` is not handling the input `key` correctly, leading to inconsistencies when different types of keys are used. This is leading to the errors mentioned in the GitHub issue, where the behavior of list indexers is different from array-like indexers.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the handling of different types of keys. The function needs to be modified to handle different types of keys consistently.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling all types of input keys uniformly, leading to inconsistencies in behavior.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` should be modified to handle different types of keys in a consistent manner. It should also handle list indexers the same way it handles array-like indexers.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to update the conditional checks in the `_get_with` function to handle different types of keys uniformly. This can be achieved by implementing a set of conditional checks that cover all possible types of input keys and handle them consistently.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, list, Series, Index, ExtensionArray)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected code should handle all types of keys consistently and resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub post.
