The issue here is that the function is not handling the case of a list indexer properly, resulting in inconsistent behavior compared to other indexer types. This inconsistency is causing the bug to manifest.

The bug is likely caused by the function not appropriately handling the list indexer case when trying to match the key with the index of the Series. This leads to a KeyError being raised inconsistently for list indexers as opposed to other indexer types.

To resolve this bug, the function needs to be updated to handle list indexers in a consistent manner with other types of indexers.

One possible approach for fixing the bug would be to update the logic in the `_get_with` function to appropriately handle list indexers. This could involve checking for list-like indexers and ensuring that they are matched with the index of the Series correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected code for the buggy function
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
        
    # Handle list-like indexers
    if isinstance(key, list):
        # Ensure that list-like indexers are matched with the Series index
        if len(key) > 0 and all(k in self.index for k in key):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            # Raise a KeyError for list indexers that do not match any index values
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
    else:
        if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)
    return self.reindex(key)
``` 

This corrected code should handle list indexers in a consistent manner with other types of indexers, ensuring that they are appropriately matched with the index of the Series and raising a KeyError if none of the values in the list match the index.
