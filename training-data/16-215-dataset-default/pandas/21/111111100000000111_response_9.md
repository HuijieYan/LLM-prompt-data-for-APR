1. The buggy function is a part of the class Series in the file pandas/core/series.py. The related functions mentioned are _slice, _get_values_tuple, and reindex which are also part of the same class. The GitHub issue indicates that there is inconsistent behavior when using list indexers compared to array-like indexers, and there seems to be a KeyError raised in the case of list indexers.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be in the section where list indexers are being handled, as indicated by the GitHub issue.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is not handling list indexers correctly, leading to inconsistent behavior and raising a KeyError in certain cases. The GitHub issue points out that list indexers are not being treated consistently with array-like indexers, and a specific test broke due to this inconsistency.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Ensuring consistent handling of list indexers with array-like indexers
   - Reviewing the logic for handling different types of indexers and making necessary adjustments
   - Testing the behavior of the function with different types of indexers to ensure consistency

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # handle array-like indexers and list indexers consistently
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    # handle other types of indexers
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected code should handle list indexers consistently with array-like indexers, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub problem description.
