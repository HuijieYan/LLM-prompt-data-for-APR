The issue with the buggy function is that it does not handle the case where the key is a list, numpy array, Index, or Series correctly. It is also not handling the KeyError properly for these cases, resulting in the failing tests.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to handle these cases appropriately. We should also ensure that the function raises the KeyError when an item is not found in the index.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            raise
```

This corrected code should handle the cases where the key is a list, numpy array, Index, or Series correctly, and it should also raise a KeyError when an item is not found in the index.

With this corrected code, the failing tests should pass, and the expected input/output variable information provided should also be satisfied.
