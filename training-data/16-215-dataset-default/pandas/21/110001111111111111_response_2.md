The issue in the buggy function appears to be related to the indexing behavior when using a list indexer. The failing test is checking for the behavior of the Series when indexed with different types of objects, including a list. It seems that the buggy function is not handling the list indexer case correctly, leading to the KeyError when trying to access the Series with a list as an index.

The bug seems to be caused by the handling of the list index case in the `_get_with` function. It is not correctly processing the list index and throwing a KeyError instead of returning the expected behavior.

To fix the bug, the handling of the list index case needs to be reviewed and corrected. It should return the appropriate behavior for a list index, as it does for other types of indexes.

The corrected code for the `_get_with` function should be as follows:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    # Corrected handling for list index
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected code should handle the list index case correctly and pass the failing test, as well as satisfy the expected input/output variable information. Additionally, it would address the issue mentioned in the GitHub report by providing consistent behavior across different types of indexers.
