The problem seems to be related to incorrect handling of the key parameter in the `_get_with` function. There are multiple cases for different types of `key` and the function is not handling them properly.

The failing test function is trying to index a Series using a key and expects a `KeyError` to be raised, but it is not being raised as expected.

The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect handling of different types of keys in the `_get_with` function. The function is not properly handling the key and not raising the `KeyError` in some cases where it should.

To fix the bug:
1. We need to explicitly handle the cases where a `KeyError` is expected to be raised, such as when the key is not present in the index of the Series.
2. Properly handle different types of keys and raise the `KeyError` when necessary.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            raise KeyError(f"Key '{key}' not found in index")
    elif not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
        
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            try:
                return self.loc[key]
            except KeyError:
                raise KeyError(f"Key '{key}' not found in index")
        else:
            try:
                return self.iloc[key]
            except KeyError:
                raise KeyError(f"Key '{key}' not found in index")

    if isinstance(key, list):
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            raise KeyError(f"Key '{key}' not found in index")

    try:
        return self.reindex(key)
    except KeyError:
        raise KeyError(f"Key '{key}' not found in index")
```

With this corrected code, the `_get_with` function should pass the failing test and raise `KeyError` when the key is not found in the index of the Series.
