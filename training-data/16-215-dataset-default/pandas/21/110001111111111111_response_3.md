The bug in the _get_with function is likely occurring due to the inconsistency in how list indexers are handled compared to array-like indexers.

The failing test is expecting the behavior of list, ndarray, Index, and Series to be the same when passed as indexers to a Series. However, the list case is causing a KeyError while the other cases are not.

Based on the information provided, it seems that the issue is arising from the handling of list indexers in the _get_with function. This discrepancy is causing the KeyError to be raised when using a list as an indexer, while other types of indexers do not raise this error.

To fix this bug, the _get_with function needs to be modified to handle list indexers in a similar way to how it handles array-like indexers. This will involve adjusting the conditional statements and how the key is processed in the function.

The corrected code for the buggy _get_with function is as follows:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected code should handle list indexers in the same way as other types of indexers, allowing it to pass the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
