The problematic function is `_get_with` in the `Series` class. The function is responsible for handling different types of indexers and returning the appropriate result. The error message indicates that there is an inconsistency in how list indexers are handled compared to other types of indexers, leading to a `KeyError` when using a list indexer.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle list indexers in the same way as other indexers, leading to unexpected behavior and inconsistent results.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should be modified to handle list indexers in the same way as other indexers to ensure consistent behavior.

Here is the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function should handle all types of indexers consistently, and the failing test should pass. The correction ensures that list indexers are treated the same as other indexers, resolving the inconsistency and addressing the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
