The issue is likely caused by the different treatment of array-like indexers, list indexers, and Index(indexers) within the `_get_with` function. The GitHub issue also highlights the inconsistency in behaviors for these different indexer types.

The potential error location is within the conditional logic block where the type of the key is being checked. This block of code determines how the key will be handled based on its type.

The bug's cause is the inconsistent handling of different types of indexers, leading to unexpected and inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers to access the Series.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to ensure consistent treatment of different types of indexers. This could involve modifying the conditional logic to handle each type of indexer in a uniform manner, ensuring that all indexers return consistent results.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type in ("integer", "string"):
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if key_type == "boolean":
            return self.loc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected code will handle the different types of indexers consistently, ensuring that they all return the expected results and resolve the inconsistencies highlighted in the GitHub issue.
