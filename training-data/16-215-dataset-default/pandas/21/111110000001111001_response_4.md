The potential error in the buggy function is in the condition where the key type is being inferred, specifically in the block where the key type is being checked as "integer". This check is erroneous and is leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the condition checking for the key_type as "integer" needs to be revised. It should be modified to handle the cases where the key type can be inferred as a string or object, as per the provided input/output variable information. Additionally, the condition for handling key as "list" should be revised to function correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type in ["string", "unicode", "object"]:  # Handle string type as well
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```
By making these changes, the corrected function will now handle the different types of 'key' as expected and return the correct results based on the input/output variable information provided.
