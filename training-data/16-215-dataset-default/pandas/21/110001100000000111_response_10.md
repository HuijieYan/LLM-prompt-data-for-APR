1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of key inputs, such as slice, DataFrame, tuple, etc. The related functions `_slice`, `_get_values_tuple`, and `reindex` are called within `_get_with` to handle specific types of keys.

The GitHub issue discusses the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated differently from array-like indexers when used with the `Series`. The issue highlights that using `ser[list(key)]` raises a KeyError, while the other cases do not.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function `_get_with` could be the section where it handles the different types of key inputs, especially the part related to lists.

3. The bug's cause lies in the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to array-like indexers within the `_get_with` function. This can be seen in the GitHub issue, which presents examples of how different types of indexers are handled, and the inconsistency in behavior when using a list as a key.

Potential Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
- Ensure that list indexers are handled consistently with array-like indexers within the `_get_with` function.
- Address the KeyError raised when using `ser[list(key)]` by aligning the behavior with the other cases and ensuring proper handling of list indexers.

Corrected code for the problematic function `_get_with`:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected code, special attention has been given to the handling of list indexers to ensure consistency with array-like indexers. This should address the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue and align the behavior of list indexers with other types of indexers.
