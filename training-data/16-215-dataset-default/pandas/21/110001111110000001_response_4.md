The issue lies within the `_get_with` function in the `pandas/core/series.py` file. The error message indicates that a `KeyError` is not being raised as expected, suggesting that the function is not handling the provided key correctly.

The `_get_with` function attempts to handle different types of keys, including slices, DataFrames, tuples, and various other types. However, it seems that the handling of these different types of keys may not be correct, leading to the `KeyError` not being raised when it should.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the different types of keys and ensure that the `KeyError` is raised when an invalid key is provided.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError("Invalid key provided")

    key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, pd.Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, if an invalid key is provided, a `KeyError` will be raised, ensuring that the failing test will pass.
