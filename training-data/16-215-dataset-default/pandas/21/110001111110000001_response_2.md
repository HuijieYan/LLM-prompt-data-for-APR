The problematic function `_get_with(self, key)` appears to be handling different types of keys, such as slices, dataframes, tuples, and lists. The bug seems to be related to how it handles the key type `pd.Index`, `pd.Series`, and other list-like objects.

The failing test is raising a `KeyError`, which means that the code is not handling the key type properly, resulting in an error.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to handle the different types of keys correctly. This includes `pd.Index`, `pd.Series`, and other list-like objects. The error seems to be in the section where it handles `isinstance(key, list)`, `is_list_like(key)`, and `isinstance(key, Index)`. Additionally, the code should correctly handle the different types of keys and avoid raising a `KeyError`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index) or isinstance(key, pd.Series):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected code should handle all types of keys, including `pd.Index`, `pd.Series`, and other list-like objects, and should pass the failing test by not raising a `KeyError`.
