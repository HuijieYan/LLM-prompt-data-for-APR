The issue seems to stem from how the function is handling different types of indexers, particularly when a list is used as an indexer.

The actual input/output variable information shows that the key_type is not being correctly identified in several cases, resulting in the incorrect return value. This aligns with the GitHub issue, which describes inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers.

To fix the bug, the function should determine the type of the key correctly and handle it accordingly. Additionally, it should ensure consistent behavior when using different types of indexers.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected code, the function first checks if the key is a slice, then an instance of a DataFrame, then a tuple, and finally, if it's a list or another index type. It then handles each case accordingly, ensuring consistent behavior for different types of indexers.

This corrected code should resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
