The issue with the buggy function is that it is not handling certain types of keys properly. It is also not handling certain types of input data, causing the KeyError to not be raised as expected.

To fix the bug:
1. Update the `_get_with` function to handle different key types such as lists, ndarrays, Indexes, and Series appropriately.
2. Use the correct indexing methods based on the key type.
3. Ensure that a KeyError is raised if the key does not exist in the index.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (int, str)):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
```

With this correction, the function should now handle various types of keys appropriately and raise a KeyError if the key does not exist in the index. This will ensure that the failing test cases are addressed and the function behaves as expected.

The corrected function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information and pass the failing test cases.
