The issue appears to be that the function `_get_with` is not handling the input parameter `key` correctly in various cases.

Based on the failing test cases and expected values, it seems that the function should identify the type of the `key` and return the result accordingly.

Here's the corrected implementation for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, pd.Index, pd.Series)):
        if all(k in self.index for k in key):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the {self.index}")
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This implementation first checks if the `key` is of type list, numpy array, pandas Index, or pandas Series, and then performs the appropriate action based on whether all elements of the key exist in the index. If they do, it returns the corresponding values using `self.loc[key]`, otherwise it raises a KeyError with the appropriate message. If the `key` is not of the aforementioned types, it calls `self.reindex(key)`.

This implementation should resolve the issues and make the failing tests pass.
