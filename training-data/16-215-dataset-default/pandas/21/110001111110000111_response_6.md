The issue is related to the inconsistency when using different types of indexers with the `ser` Series. When using a list indexer, it raises a KeyError, while using other types of indexers does not raise an error.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the section where it checks for the type of the key and decides how to handle it.

The bug's cause is that the function is not handling list indexers consistently with other types of indexers, leading to a KeyError being raised when using a list indexer.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles list indexers consistently with other types of indexers.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (pd.DataFrame, ABCDataFrame)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (pd.Index, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected code, the function should handle list indexers consistently with other types of indexers, and it should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub issue.
