This buggy code is a method within the Pandas library that is responsible for handling index-based lookups. The failing test is trying to access a value in a Series using an index that doesn't exist, and it's expecting a KeyError to be raised. However, the error message indicates that the KeyError is not being raised as expected, which suggests that the bug is related to the handling of non-existent keys in the _get_with function.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the block that handles non-existent keys, specifically the part where it tries to return self.loc[key] when the key is not list-like.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct behavior is implemented for different types of keys, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, non-list-like keys, and keys of type Index.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (pd.DataFrame, pd.Series)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or Series is not supported."
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, pd.core.arrays.categorical.Categorical, pd.MultiIndex)):
        key = [key]
    elif isinstance(key, pd.Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, pd.MultiIndex):
        xuvals_types = key.levels
        if len(xuvals_types) > 1:
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            raise ValueError("Index does not support multi-\/labled Index")

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making these changes, the function should now correctly handle different types of keys and raise the appropriate exceptions when necessary, which will enable it to pass the failing test.
