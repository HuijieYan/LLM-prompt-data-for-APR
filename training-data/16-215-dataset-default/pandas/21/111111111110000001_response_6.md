The buggy function `_get_with` is trying to handle different types of `key` inputs, including a `slice`, an `ABCDataFrame`, a `tuple`, and other iterable or scalar values. However, the function is not properly handling the different types of input, which is causing the error.

The failing test is trying to index a Series `ser` using `ser[key]`. The error message indicates that a `KeyError` was expected, but the function did not raise it. This suggests that the function is not correctly handling the key input.

The possible cause of the bug is that the function `_get_with` is not properly identifying and handling the different types of input keys, leading to an incorrect behavior when trying to index the Series.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` should be modified to correctly handle different types of input keys, ensuring that the indexing behavior is consistent and that the expected errors (such as `KeyError`) are raised when necessary.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # handle non-list-like and non-boolean key types
    if not is_list_like(key) or not is_bool(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # handle list and array-like key types
    if isinstance(key, pd.Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # Decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer or label-based
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```
This corrected function should handle different types of input keys appropriately, ensuring that the indexing behavior is consistent and the expected errors are raised when necessary.
