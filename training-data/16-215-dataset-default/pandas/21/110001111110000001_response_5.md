The problematic function is `_get_with` from the `pandas/core/series.py` file. The function contains several conditional branches to handle different types of keys, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, and others. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` tests the behavior of the function when the key is a Series and expects a `KeyError` to be raised, but it does not. This indicates that the function is not handling the key correctly.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional branch for the `ABCDataFrame` instance check. This condition is not handling the key correctly, leading to the test failure.

To fix the bug, we need to review the logic for handling different key types in the function and make sure that the key is correctly processed to produce the desired result.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif pd.api.types.is_list_like(key):
        if is_categorical_dtype(key):
            key = np.asarray(key)
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        if key_type == "integer":
            return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.loc[key]
```

By handling the different key types appropriately and applying the necessary logic for each type, the corrected function should pass the failing test and provide the expected behavior.
