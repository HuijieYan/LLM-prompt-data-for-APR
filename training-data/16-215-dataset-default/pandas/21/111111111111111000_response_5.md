The bug in the `_get_with` function is caused by mismatched logic in handling different types of keys. The code should be updated to handle each type of key appropriately. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, (tuple, list, np.ndarray)):
        # Handle tuples, lists, and numpy arrays
        if len(key) == 1:
            key = key[0]  # If only one element, extract it from the iterable
        if key in self.index:
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)  # Use _get_values_tuple for tuple
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)  # Use reindex for both list and numpy array
    else:
        # Handle other single values
        return self.loc[key]  # Use loc for single values
```

This should address the issue of treating different input types appropriately and ensure that the function behaves as expected for each case.

Please note that the implementation above is a best guess based on the provided code and failing tests. It may need to be further refined based on the broader functionality and requirements of the software.
