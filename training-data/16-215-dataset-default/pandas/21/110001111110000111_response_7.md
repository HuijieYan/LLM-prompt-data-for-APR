Analysis:
The buggy function is supposed to handle different types of indexers and return the values accordingly. However, it fails to do so and raises errors when dealing with list indexers. This inconsistency causes the failing test and has also been reported as an issue on GitHub.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of list indexers.

The bug's cause is that the function does not handle list indexers properly and raises errors instead of returning the expected values.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the function to handle list indexers similar to other array-like indexers.
2. Modify the function to return the values for list indexers instead of raising errors.

Corrected code:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)

```

With the corrected code, the function can handle list indexers properly and would return the expected values instead of raising errors. This would resolve the failing test and also address the issue reported on GitHub.
