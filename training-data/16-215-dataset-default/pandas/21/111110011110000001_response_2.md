1. The problematic function is `_get_with` within the `Series` class. The failing test is testing for behavior when attempting to access a key that is not in the index. The error message indicates that the function did not raise a `KeyError` as expected.

2. The potential error location is located in the conditional block starting with `if not is_list_like(key):`. It seems that the logic for handling different types of keys might be incorrect.

3. (a). The problematic function `_get_with` contains the logic for handling different types of keys and returning the corresponding values from the Series. The issue likely lies in the conditional blocks determining the type of key and how it should be handled.

   (b). The class `Series` is a one-dimensional ndarray with axis labels that supports both integer- and label-based indexing. The behavior of the `Series` is determined by its methods, and the `_get_with` function is responsible for retrieving values from the `Series` based on the input key.

   (c). The failing test is checking for the behavior of accessing a key that is not in the index. The error message indicates that the function did not raise a `KeyError` as expected, suggesting that the function may be incorrectly handling this scenario.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Review the conditional logic in the `_get_with` function to ensure that it correctly handles different types of keys and appropriately raises a `KeyError` when the key is not found in the index.
   - Validate the logic for checking the type of the key and determine whether it is being handled correctly in all cases.
   - Verify that the reindexing logic is correctly applied when the key is not found in the index.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function `get_with`:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError(f"{key} not in index")
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```
This corrected code adds an additional conditional block to handle the case when the key is not found in the index and raises a `KeyError` with the corresponding key. This update ensures that the function behaves as expected when attempting to access a key that is not in the index.
