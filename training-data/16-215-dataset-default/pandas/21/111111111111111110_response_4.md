The issue in the `_get_with` function is that it is not correctly handling the list-like indexers. The function should treat list, ndarray, Index, and Series indexers consistently, but it fails to do so. To fix the issue, the function needs to be updated to handle all cases of indexers in a consistent manner.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Index, Series)): 
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    else:
        raise TypeError("Unsupported indexer type")
```

With this correction, the `_get_with` function will now handle all types of indexers (list, ndarray, Index, and Series) in a consistent manner, and the failing test cases should pass.

The fixed function now treats all indexers in the same manner, ensuring a consistent behavior for list, ndarray, Index, and Series indexers. This change will align with the expected behavior and address the inconsistencies reported in the failing test cases and the associated GitHub issue.
