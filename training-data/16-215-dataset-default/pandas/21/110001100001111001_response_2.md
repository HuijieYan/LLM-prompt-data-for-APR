There are several issues in the buggy function that need to be addressed. The key problem is that the function checks for the data type of the key variable in various ways, but it doesn't handle the case where the key is a list of strings. Additionally, there are issues with the return statements for different data types.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key_type variable correctly identifies the type of the key and then handle each type appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif isinstance(key, list) and all(isinstance(k, str) for k in key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected code handles the case where the key is a list of strings and also returns the appropriate value based on the data type of the key.
