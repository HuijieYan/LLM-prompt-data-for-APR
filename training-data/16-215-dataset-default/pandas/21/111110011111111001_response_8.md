The bug in the given function is likely caused by the incorrect handling of the key_type string. The key_type is being set to "string" but it should be "object" when key is a list or ndarray. This causes the function to return an incorrect value, leading to the failing test.

To fix this bug, the key_type should be correctly inferred based on the type of the key being passed to the function. If key is a list or ndarray, the key_type should be set to "object" to align with the type of the key. This will ensure that the function returns the expected value and type.

Additionally, there seems to be an issue with handling different types of keys. It's important to ensure that all cases of keys are handled correctly and result in the proper return value.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = 'object' if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray)) else lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected code should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
