The issue seems to stem from the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated differently from other indexers in the given Series class. The bug is likely in the `_get_with` function, specifically in how it handles the key type for list indexers.

The function should consistently handle the different types of indexers, ensuring that all indexers, including list indexers, are handled properly without raising errors.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to adjust the conditional checks for different types of indexers and ensure that list indexers are handled in a consistent manner with other types of indexers.

The corrected code for the `_get_with` function is provided below:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (slice, ABCDataFrame, tuple)):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle list-like key
    key = list(key)
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected code will handle all types of indexers, including list indexers, in a consistent manner without raising any errors.
