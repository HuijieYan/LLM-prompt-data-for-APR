The buggy function is `_get_with` within the `Series` class in the pandas library. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is parametrized with various types of indexers, such as list, np.array, pd.Index, and pd.Series. When using a list indexer, the test raises a `KeyError` with the message "None of [Index(['C'], dtype='object')] are in the [index]". However, when using other types of indexers, the test does not raise an error. This inconsistency is highlighted in the GitHub issue titled "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]".

The potential error in the `_get_with` function seems to be the treatment of a list indexer compared to other types of indexers. The handling of the list indexer results in a `KeyError`, while other types of indexers do not produce the same error.

To fix the bug, the code in the `_get_with` function needs to be updated to ensure consistent behavior regardless of the type of indexer used. Additionally, the code should address the specific discrepancy in how list indexers are handled compared to other types of indexers.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This updated code checks if the key is list-like, and if so, it uses `self.loc` to return the result. Otherwise, for other types of keys, it uses `self.reindex` to handle the operation. This approach ensures consistent handling of different types of indexers and addresses the issues raised in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
