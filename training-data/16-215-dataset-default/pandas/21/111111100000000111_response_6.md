The bug is related to how list indexers are treated differently from array-like indexers in the _get_with function of the Series class. This issue is discussed in the GitHub issue titled "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]". The problem arises when using list indexers, which causes a KeyError when trying to access elements that don't exist in the index.

Upon analysis, the potential error location within the problematic function is the section where list indexers are being handled, specifically the code block:
```python
if not is_list_like(key):
    return self.loc[key]

if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
    key = list(key)

if isinstance(key, Index):
    key_type = key.inferred_type
else:
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
```

The bug's cause is that list indexers are not being handled properly, leading to a KeyError when elements that don't exist in the index are being accessed.

To fix the bug, the _get_with function needs to be updated to handle list indexers in a similar way to how array-like indexers are handled. This will ensure consistency and prevent KeyErrors when accessing non-existent elements.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    elif isinstance(key, (tuple, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This updated code will handle list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers, ensuring consistency and resolving the KeyError issue.
