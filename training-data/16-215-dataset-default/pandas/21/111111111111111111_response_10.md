The issue arises from the inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers (e.g., list, array-like, Index, Series) in the `ser[key]` expression. The specific problem lies in the `_get_with` function within the `Series` class. It is not treating list indexers the same as other array-like indexers, which causes the inconsistent behavior.

The cause of the bug may be that the function `_get_with` is not handling the list indexer case correctly, leading to a failure to raise a KeyError as expected.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to be modified to handle list indexers in a consistent manner with other array-like indexers. This may involve adjusting the conditional statements for different types of indexers and making sure that the behavior is consistent across all types.

The corrected code for the `_get_with` function is as follows:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        # Handle the case for other types of indexers
        return self.loc[key]
```

In this corrected code, we've removed the conditional statement for handling the list indexer separately and instead included it in the final `else` block to ensure consistent treatment across all types of indexers.

With this correction, the `_get_with` function should now handle list indexers in a manner consistent with other array-like indexers, resolving the issue and passing the failing test. This fix also aligns with the proposed solution in the GitHub issue.
