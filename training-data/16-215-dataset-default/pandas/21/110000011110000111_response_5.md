The bug appears to be in the way the function `_get_with` handles different types of indexers, specifically when it comes to a list indexer. When attempting to retrieve items using a list indexer, the function does not handle it consistently with other types of indexers, resulting in a KeyError in the test.

The failing test function `test_getitem_no_matches` uses different types of indexers (list, array, Index, Series) to access items from a Series. When using a list indexer, the test expects a KeyError due to the absence of the specified item in the Series. However, the function does not raise the KeyError as expected, leading to test failure.

The GitHub issue "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]" points out the inconsistency in how list indexers are handled compared to other indexers, resulting in unexpected behavior. The issue suggests that all different types of indexers should behave in a similar manner to improve consistency.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to be updated to handle list indexers consistently with other types of indexers. It should raise a KeyError when accessing items from the Series using a list indexer if the specified item is not found.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With these changes, the `_get_with` function should handle list indexers consistently with other types of indexers, ensuring that the test case `test_getitem_no_matches` passes as expected. Additionally, this correction aligns with the GitHub issue's goal of achieving consistent behavior for different types of indexers.
