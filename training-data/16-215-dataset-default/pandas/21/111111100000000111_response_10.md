1. The buggy function `_get_with` is part of the `Series` class in the pandas library. This function handles different types of indexers and calls other functions such as `_slice`, `_get_values_tuple`, and `reindex` based on the type of indexer. The GitHub issue "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]" highlights the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated differently from array-like indexers.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the section that handles the case when `key` is a list. This is evident from the GitHub issue description where `ser[list(key)]` raises an error.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function `_get_with` tries to handle different types of indexers, including lists.
   (b). The `Series` class contains related functions such as `_slice`, `_get_values_tuple`, and `reindex` that are called based on the type of indexer.
   (c). The functions mentioned above are intended to handle different types of indexing, but the handling of lists may be inconsistent, leading to the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
   (d). The GitHub issue reveals that the behavior of list indexers is inconsistent compared to array-like indexers, leading to the confusion and an error being raised.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Review and standardize the handling of list indexers to make it consistent with array-like indexers.
   - Implement logic in the `_get_with` function to correctly handle list indexers without raising errors.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Handle list indexers
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.reindex(key)
    
    # Handle other types of indexers
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle other cases
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected function modifies the handling of list indexers by directly calling `self.reindex(key)` when `key` is a list. This should address the inconsistency mentioned in the GitHub issue and ensure that list indexers are handled without errors.
