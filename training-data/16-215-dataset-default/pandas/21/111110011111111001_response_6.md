The issue appears to be with the way the function is handling the `key` parameter, particularly when it is a list or not recognized as certain data types. The function should appropriately handle different data types for the `key` parameter to avoid the KeyError that is being raised in the failing test.

It seems that the current function is not handling the key appropriately and is returning the wrong `key_type`, which leads to the KeyError being raised in the test. The function should handle different types of `key` parameters properly to avoid this error.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to update the conditions checking for different types of `key`, and to ensure that the correct type is determined and used for further processing.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, pd.Index, pd.Series)):
        if isinstance(key, pd.Series):
            key = key.values
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        elif key_type == "string":
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected function should satisfy the failing test and the expected input/output variable information, ensuring that it handles different types of `key` parameter appropriately to avoid the KeyError being raised.
