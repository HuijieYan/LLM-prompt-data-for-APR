The issue in the `_get_with` function is that it is handling the list-like key differently from other types of indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior. To fix this issue, we need to ensure that all types of indexers are handled consistently.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # Convert key to list if it's not already one
    key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["string", "mixed-integer"]:
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version handles all types of indexers consistently, ensuring that the behavior is the same regardless of the type of indexer used. The `KeyError` issue with list indexers should also be resolved with this correction.
