The bug in the `_get_with` function is likely causing the KeyError that is being raised in the failing test. The function is intended to handle different types of input keys and return the corresponding values from the Series object. However, it seems that it fails to handle the input key properly in some cases, leading to the KeyError.

To address the issue, the code for handling the input key needs to be revised. It appears that the function should be able to properly handle different types of keys, such as lists, np.ndarray, Index, and Series. The function should correctly determine the type of the input key and return the appropriate values based on the key type.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Index, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This revised code should address the issue by properly handling different types of input keys and returning the expected values from the Series object.

By making these changes, the `_get_with` function should now pass the failing test scenarios and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
