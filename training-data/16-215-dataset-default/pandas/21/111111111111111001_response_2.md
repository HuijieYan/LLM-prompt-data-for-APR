The issue in the _get_with function seems to be caused by a failure to handle certain input types correctly, leading to a KeyError when trying to access the Series with a specific key.

The failing test suggests that different types are being tested as input keys (list, np.array, pd.Index, pd.Series), and the error message indicates that a KeyError is being raised when trying to access the Series with the given key in each of these cases.

To fix the bug, the _get_with function should be updated to properly handle the different input types for the key parameter. It should also ensure that the KeyError is not raised when attempting to access the Series with a valid key.

Here's the corrected code for the _get_with function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    try:
        return self.loc[key]
    except (KeyError, IndexError):
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This update ensures that the different input types for the key parameter are handled appropriately. Additionally, the function attempts to access the Series using the key and then falls back to reindexing in case of a KeyError or IndexError.

This corrected code is expected to pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
