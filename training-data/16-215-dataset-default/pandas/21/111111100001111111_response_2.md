The problem in the buggy function seems to lie in the handling of list indexers. The error occurs when the input key is a list but not when it's an array-like object or an Index object, causing inconsistencies in behavior. The GitHub issue also points out the inconsistency in behavior when using a list indexer compared to other types of indexers.

To fix the bug, we should modify the handling of list indexers to be consistent with how other types of indexers are handled.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (str, bytes)):
        # handle non-list-like indexers including string, bytes
        return self.loc[key]

    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This fixes the inconsistency issue by treating list indexers in the same way as other non-array-like or non-Index indexers.

This corrected code should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post by making the behavior consistent across different types of indexers.
