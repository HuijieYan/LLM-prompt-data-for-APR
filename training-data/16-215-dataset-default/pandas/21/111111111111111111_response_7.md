The buggy function is `_get_with` in the `Series` class, which is used for indexing and accessing values in a pandas Series. The issue arises when using different types of indexers such as lists, arrays, and pandas Index or Series objects. It seems that the function is not handling the list type of indexer correctly, resulting in a KeyError when trying to access values using a list indexer.

The problem is likely caused by a discrepancy in how different types of indexers are being processed within the `_get_with` function. The function is not properly handling list-like indexers, leading to a KeyError in certain cases.

The failing test cases use different types of indexers to access elements from a Series, and they expect consistent behavior and no KeyError. However, the actual behavior of the `_get_with` function is leading to a KeyError when using a list-like indexer.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to be modified to handle list-like indexers properly, ensuring consistent behavior across different types of indexers. This could involve updating the conditional logic for different types of indexers and refining the method for accessing and returning values based on the type of indexer used.

Additionally, the corrections should align with the GitHub issue raised, which questions the inconsistencies in the behavior of different types of indexers.

Below is the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (str, bytes)):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        elif key_type == "string" or key_type == "mixed":
            return self.reindex(key)
        else:
            raise ValueError("Unsupported indexer type")
    else:
        raise ValueError("Unsupported indexer type")
```

The corrected function now properly handles list-like indexers and ensures consistent behavior across different types of indexers. This revised code should pass the failing test cases, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub discussion.
