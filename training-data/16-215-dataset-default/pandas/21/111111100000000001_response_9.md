1. The buggy function is a method within the `Series` class and is used to retrieve values from the series based on the input key. It checks the type of the key and performs different operations based on its type. The class `Series` has related functions such as `_slice`, `_get_values_tuple`, and `reindex`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the logic that handles different types of keys and decides how to retrieve the values from the series.

3. The bug's cause could be related to incorrect handling of different types of keys, leading to unexpected behavior when retrieving values from the series.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Review the logic for handling different types of keys and ensure that the correct operations are performed for each type.
   - Check for any inconsistencies in the type checking and handling of keys.
   - Use appropriate error handling and messages for unsupported key types.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle other types of keys such as lists, arrays, and Index
    return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected code, the logic for handling different types of keys has been simplified and the unnecessary checks and conversions have been removed. The function now directly uses `self.loc[key]` to retrieve values for various types of keys, as this method already handles different types of keys appropriately. Any unsupported key types will result in a `TypeError` with an appropriate error message.
