The buggy function is written in Python and is part of the pandas library. The function seems to be handling the indexing for a Series object. The failing test function is testing for the behavior of the `__getitem__` method of a Series object when a key that does not exist in the Series index is passed.

The potential error in the buggy function lies in the conditional checks and the handling of different types of keys. It appears that the function is not handling certain types of keys properly, leading to the failing test.

The bug's cause is that the function is not correctly handling the different types of keys that are passed to it, specifically when a key that does not exist in the Series index is provided.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles different types of keys and raises the appropriate exception when a key does not exist in the Series index.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, pd.Index, pd.Series)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        raise KeyError(str(key) + " not found in the index")
```

With this corrected code, the function will handle the different types of keys properly and raise a `KeyError` when a key that does not exist in the Series index is provided. This should ensure that the function passes the failing test provided.
