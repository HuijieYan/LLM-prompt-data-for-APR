1. The buggy function `_get_with` is a method of the `Series` class, and it is responsible for handling different types of indexers like slices, DataFrames, tuples, and list-like objects. The GitHub issue is related to inconsistencies in the behavior of indexers when used with the `Series` class, specifically when using a list indexer. The issue describes how list indexers behave differently from array-like indexers, causing KeyError in some cases.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the block of code that handles `list` indexers, where it is not handling the case correctly and causing inconsistencies in behavior.

3. The bug's cause is that the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class is not correctly handling list indexers, which leads to inconsistent behavior when using list indexers as opposed to array-like indexers. This is consistent with the information provided in the GitHub issue, which points out the inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Ensuring that the handling of list indexers is consistent with the handling of array-like indexers.
   - Checking for the existence of the key in the index and handling the cases where it does not exist appropriately.
   - Refactoring the code to make the behavior of different types of indexers consistent.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function `_get_with`:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # handle the case of list indexers
    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # handle the case of list indexers
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    # handle the case of list indexers
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # handle the case of list indexers
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected code addresses the inconsistencies in handling list indexers and ensures that the behavior is consistent with other types of indexers. It should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
