The potential error location within the problematic function is in the section that checks the type of the `key` parameter and then returns different results based on the type.

The bug's cause is that the function is not handling all possible types of input correctly and is not providing the expected output.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to implement specific handling for each type of input, ensuring that the function returns the correct output for each case. Another approach is to refactor the function and simplify the logic to make it more robust.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not"
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle scalar, list, array, and index types
    return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected code, the unnecessary and redundant type checking has been removed, and the function directly calls `self.loc[key]` for handling scalar, list, array, and index types. This simplification should make the function more robust and eliminate the potential for errors.
