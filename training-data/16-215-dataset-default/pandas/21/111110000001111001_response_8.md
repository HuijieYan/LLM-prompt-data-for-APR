The buggy function seems to be attempting to handle different types of keys, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, and others. It calculates the key type, and based on this type, it selects a different behavior for the key.

The issue seems to be with the condition for handling keys of type 'string'. The variable 'key_type' is being set to the string literal 'string' instead of the actual type of the key.

A possible approach to fix the bug is to determine the type of the key correctly and then use this type information to handle the key appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key_type = None
    if isinstance(key, (int, float, complex, str)):
        key_type = type(key).__name__
    elif hasattr(key, 'dtype'):
        key_type = key.dtype.name
    elif hasattr(key, 'inferred_type'):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    elif is_list_like(key) and all(isinstance(k, (int, float, complex, str)) for k in key):
        key_type = 'list'
    elif is_list_like(key) and all(hasattr(k, 'dtype') for k in key):
        key_type = 'mixed_dtype_list'

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if key_type in ['list', 'mixed_dtype_list']:
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```
In this corrected code, we calculate the key type based on the key variable and handle the key accordingly. We also cover potential types that the key could be. This should address the issues that were causing the function to return an incorrect key type.
