1. The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is responsible for evaluating a frame operation by evaluating column-by-column and dispatching to the Series implementation. It uses the `column_op` function from the same file to perform column-wise operations.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be the different cases where the `column_op` function is defined based on the type of the input `right`.

3. The bug's cause is that the `column_op` function is redefined multiple times within the `dispatch_to_series` function, and it is not clear which definition will be used based on the type of `right`. This could lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect results.

4. To fix the bug, we can define the `column_op` function outside the `dispatch_to_series` function and pass it as an argument to the `dispatch_to_series` function to ensure that the correct version is used based on the type of input `right`.

5. Corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/ops/__init__.py

def column_op(a, b, func):
    return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns

    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        column_op_func = lambda a, b: column_op(a, b, func)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        column_op_func = lambda a, b: column_op(a, b, func)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        column_op_func = lambda a, b: column_op(a, b, func)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        column_op_func = lambda a, b: column_op(a, b, func)
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op_func, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected code, the `column_op` function is defined outside the `dispatch_to_series` function, and the correct version of `column_op` based on the type of input `right` is used within the `dispatch_to_series` function. This ensures that the correct behavior is achieved based on the input type.
