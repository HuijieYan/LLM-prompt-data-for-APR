1. The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` takes in two inputs `left` and `right` (both either a DataFrame or Series), a function `func`, a string representation `str_rep`, and an axis. It then evaluates the operation column by column and dispatches to the Series implementation.

2. The potential error in the buggy function lies in the implementation of the `column_op` functions, where the conditions for different input types (`right` being a scalar, DataFrame, or Series) are not being handled correctly.

3. The cause of the bug is that the conditions for handling different input types (`right` being a scalar, DataFrame, or Series) are not implemented correctly within the `dispatch_to_series` function. This is leading to incorrect evaluation of the operations on the columns.

4. To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the different input types (`right` being a scalar, DataFrame, or Series) within the `dispatch_to_series` function and modify the `column_op` functions accordingly.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected code, the `column_op` functions are now simplified to handle the different input types correctly, and the implementation ensures that the correct operation is applied to the columns based on the input types.
