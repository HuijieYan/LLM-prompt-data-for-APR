1. The problematic function is `dispatch_to_series` which is used to evaluate the operation of `func` on the DataFrame `left` and a scalar or DataFrame `right` by dispatching to the Series implementation.

2. The potential error location within the function is the handling of the `elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):` condition, specifically the `column_op` nested functions.

3. The bug is caused by the fact that the function is not handling the case where the right operand `b` is a NaT (Not a Time) type properly. This results in a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'` when trying to perform the operation.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Checking for the NaT type and handling it separately within the `column_op` functions.
   - Adding a conditional check for NaT type as a special case and performing the operation accordingly.
   - Ensuring that the code handles different types of operands gracefully, including special cases like NaT.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
    import numpy as np

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not pd.isna(b) else np.nan for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    # Other conditions remain unchanged

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected code, a check for `pd.isna(b)` is added within the `column_op` function to handle the case where `b` is `NaT` and return `np.nan` in such cases. This modification ensures that the operation can handle the NaT type gracefully and the corrected function should pass the failing test.
