After analyzing the buggy function and considering the information provided, it is evident that the issue lies within the `dispatch_to_series` function. Specifically, it seems that the `column_op` functions are not being used correctly, resulting in the TypeError observed in the failing test.

The core problem appears to be with the implementation of the `column_op` function. In this context, the value of `b` is of type Series and when trying to apply the operation `func(a.iloc[:, i], b)` inside the `column_op` function, a mismatch is observed which leads to the TypeError.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `column_op` functions are correctly handling the different types of `b` based on the conditions. 

Moreover, we would need to perform different operations based on the type of `b`, especially when it's a Series type with a check on `is_scalar` and correctly handling the scalar case.

Below is a corrected version of the dispatch_to_series function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    if is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            if is_scalar(b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            else:
                result = {}
                for i in range(len(a.columns)):
                    result[i] = func(a.iloc[:, i], b)
                return result

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By adding a condition in the `column_op` function for handling the case when `right` is a Series and is not scalar, the TypeError observed in the failing test can be avoided. This corrected version should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information and pass the failing test.
