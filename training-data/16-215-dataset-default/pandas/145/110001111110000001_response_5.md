The error occurs when the `dispatch_to_series` function is called with a DataFrame and Series for multiplication. The error suggests that there is an unsupported operand type for multiplication, specifically a 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'. This indicates that the function is trying to perform a multiplication operation between a numpy array and NaT (Not a Time) type, which is not supported.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `column_op` function that is used within the `dispatch_to_series` function. Specifically, we need to handle the case when the input right (b) is a scalar or a DataFrame to avoid the unsupported operand type error.

In the `column_op` function, we should handle the case when the right input is a scalar or a DataFrame. We can modify the function to check the type of the right input and perform the operation accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
    
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        # Handle the case when right is scalar
        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        # Handle the case when right is a DataFrame
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)
    
    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this modification, the `dispatch_to_series` function should now handle different types of right input correctly and the error in the failing test should be resolved.
