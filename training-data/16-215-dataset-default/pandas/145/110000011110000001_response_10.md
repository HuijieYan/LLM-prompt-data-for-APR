The `dispatch_to_series` function is intended to evaluate the frame operation by dispatching to the Series implementation. The failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` is trying to perform a multiplication operation between a DataFrame (`df`) and a Series (`ser`). The error message indicates that the operation is attempting to multiply an array and a `NaTType` which is causing a TypeError.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `column_op` function. Specifically, the issue may lie with how the function handles the `func` operation when the right operand is a scalar or a Series containing 'NaT' values.

The cause of the bug is that the `column_op` function does not handle the operation between the array and the `NaTType` properly, leading to a TypeError when trying to evaluate the expression.

To fix the bug, the `column_op` function needs to be modified to handle the operation between the array and the `NaTType` gracefully, ensuring that the operation is valid.

Here's the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
from pandas.core.construction import extract_array
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_scalar
from pandas.core.indexing import check_bool_indexer
from pandas.core.nanops import nanops

def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    right = extract_array(right, extract_numpy=True)
    if np.ndim(right) == 0 or is_scalar(right):
        right = np.array([right] * len(left))

    def column_op(a, b):
        return {'result': func(a, b)}

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right, columns=left.columns)
    return pd.DataFrame(new_data)
```

With this corrected code, the function `dispatch_to_series` should now correctly handle the operation between the DataFrame and the Series containing 'NaT' values, and pass the failing test.
