1. The buggy function takes in two DataFrames, a function, and optional arguments, and is supposed to perform an operation on the two DataFrames column by column. The error lies in the implementation of the function and the handling of different types of input.

2. The potential error location is in the implementation of the column_op function and the conditional statements to check the type of the 'right' input.

3. The bug's cause is that the implementation of the column_op function and the conditional statements are not handling different types of 'right' input correctly, which is causing the function to not work as intended.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Checking the type of the 'right' input more carefully and handling each type correctly.
   - Ensuring that the column_op function is able to handle different types of 'right' inputs and perform the desired operation column by column.

5. Here's the corrected code:
```python
import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected code, the handling of different types of 'right' input has been adjusted, and the column_op function has been modified to handle each type correctly. This should fix the bug and allow the function to operate as intended.
