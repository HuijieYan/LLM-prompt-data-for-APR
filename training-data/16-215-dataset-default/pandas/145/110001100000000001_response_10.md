The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is designed to evaluate the frame operation `func(left, right)` by dispatching to the Series implementation. It takes `left` as a DataFrame, `right` as a scalar or DataFrame, `func` as an arithmetic or comparison operator, `str_rep` as a string or None, and `axis` as {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}. It then uses the `column_op` function to perform the operation column-by-column, depending on the type of `right` and the value of `axis`. The bug is likely located in the `column_op` functions or in the conditional logic that determines which `column_op` function to use, based on the type of `right` and `axis`.

The bug's cause is likely related to the incorrect implementation or usage of the `column_op` functions based on the type of `right` and the value of `axis`. The `column_op` functions are designed to handle different types of `right` (scalar, DataFrame, or Series), and to perform the operation on the columns of the DataFrame `left`.

To fix the bug, the conditional logic for determining which `column_op` function to use should be reviewed and corrected if necessary. Additionally, the implementation of the `column_op` functions should be validated to ensure they correctly handle the different types of `right` and perform the operation on the columns of `left`. It may also be necessary to handle the `else` case in a more specific manner to avoid the `NotImplementedError`.

The corrected code is:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandas.core.computation.expressions import evaluate
from pandas.core.indexing import IndexingError

def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    right = pd.api.types.to_object(right)

    def column_op(a, b):
        if isinstance(b, pd.DataFrame):
            return a.apply(lambda x: func(x, b))
        elif isinstance(b, pd.Series) and axis == "columns":
            return a.apply(lambda x: func(x, b[x.name]), axis=1)
        else:
            return a.apply(lambda x: func(x, b))

    new_data = evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected code, we import the necessary libraries and use `pd.api.types.to_object` to convert `right` to a pandas object. We then define the `column_op` function to handle the different types of `right` and perform the operation on the columns of `left`. Within the `column_op` function, we apply the `func` to each column of `left` and `right` based on their types and the value of `axis`. This approach provides a more comprehensive and robust implementation for the `column_op` function.
