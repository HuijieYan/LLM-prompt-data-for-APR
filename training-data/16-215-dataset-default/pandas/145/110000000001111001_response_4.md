The potential error in the code is likely related to how the input `right` is being handled. The buggy function is designed to dispatch to the Series implementation based on the type of `right`, but it seems to mishandle the case when `right` is a Series and `axis` is passed as 'columns'.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `column_op` function to handle the case when `right` is a Series and `axis` is 'columns'. We can also simplify the code by removing unnecessary checks and assertions.

Here's the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    right = pd.Series(right)  # Convert right to a Series if it's not already

    if axis == 'columns':
        # When axis is 'columns', apply the function row-by-row
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right))
    else:
        # Otherwise, apply the function column-by-column
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right), axis=0)

    return new_data
```

This corrected code should now handle the different cases of the input parameters and produce the expected output.
