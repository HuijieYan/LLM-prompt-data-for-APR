The bug in the function is likely located in the `column_op` functions, where the operations are being performed on the columns of the DataFrame and Series. There seems to be an issue with how the DataFrame and Series are being accessed and operated on within these functions.

The discrepancy between the expected and actual input/output variable values is that the variable `b` is being assigned the entire Series object (`right`), rather than the individual values from the Series. This is likely causing issues when the operations are being performed in the `column_op` functions.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `column_op` functions to handle the operations on individual elements of the DataFrame and Series.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
    
    if isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return a.apply(lambda x: func(x, b))

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a))}

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected code should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
