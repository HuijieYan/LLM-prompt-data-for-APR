1. The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is intended to evaluate a frame operation `func(left, right)` by evaluating it column-by-column and dispatching to the Series implementation. It is clearly related to the `column_op` function where the actual evaluation takes place based on the input parameters and a given operation.

2. From the error message, it seems that the `evaluate` function calls `_evaluate` function which ultimately results in a TypeError due to unsupported operand types. This narrows down the potential error location to the `_evaluate` function or the functions invoked by it.

3. The bug is caused by the fact that the `_evaluate` function is unable to handle the 'NaT' values properly when performing the arithmetic operation. This impacts the entire operation cascade leading to the failure of the test. The function `column_op` is also involved in the error due to the unsupported operand types.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Implementing a check for 'NaT' values and handling them appropriately within the `_evaluate` function.
   - Modifying the `column_op` function to handle 'NaT' values when performing the arithmetic operation.
   - Ensuring that all related functions handle 'NaT' values gracefully.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right, use_numexpr=False)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected code, `use_numexpr` is set to `False` during expression evaluation, which should help in avoiding the unsupported operand type error related to 'NaT' values. This should satisfy the failing test.
