1. The buggy function is meant to evaluate the frame operation `func(left, right)` by evaluating column-by-column and dispatching to the Series implementation. It contains multiple conditional statements to handle different scenarios based on the type of `right` input.

2. The potential error location within the function could be the conditional statements where the type of `right` input is being checked and different operations are being defined based on its type.

3. The bug's cause is related to the conditional statements not being structured correctly, which may result in the function not handling all possible input scenarios as intended.

4. To fix the bug, the conditional statements should be restructured to handle all possible input scenarios and define the appropriate column operations based on the type of `right` input. Additionally, error handling for unsupported input types should be implemented to prevent the function from raising exceptions.

5. Corrected code:
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
from pandas._libs import lib
from pandas.core.frame import DataFrame
from pandas.core.generic import ABCDataFrame
from pandas.core.series import Series, ABCSeries

def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index) and right.columns.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[b.index.get_loc(i)], axis=1) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b, axis=0) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```
In the corrected code, the conditional statements have been restructured to handle different input types appropriately, and error handling has been added to raise a `NotImplementedError` for unsupported input types. Additionally, the column operations are defined based on the type of `right` input and the relationship with the `left` input's index and columns.
