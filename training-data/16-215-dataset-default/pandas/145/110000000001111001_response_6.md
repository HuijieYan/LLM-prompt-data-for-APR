The potential error in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be due to a mismatch in the expected and actual input/output variable values.

The function aims to dispatch the frame operation `func(left, right)` by evaluating it column-by-column, and then dispatching to the Series implementation. However, a bug is causing unexpected outcomes in the returned variables `a` and `b`.

To fix this, the condition that checks for the type of `right` and the `axis` value when `right` is an instance of `ABCDataFrame` should be revisited.

One possible approach to fix this bug could be to modify the condition to properly handle the case when `right` is an instance of `ABCDataFrame`. This would involve ensuring that the operation `func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i])` is performed correctly for each column `i`.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected version should now correctly handle different scenarios and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
