The buggy function is dispatch_to_series, which is used to perform frame operations by evaluating column-by-column and dispatching to the Series implementation. The failing test is test_td64_op_nat_casting, which tests the behavior of calling dispatch_to_series in DataFrame arithmetic.

The error message indicates that there is an unsupported operand type(s) for multiplication ('*' operator) involving a numpy array and a NaTType (Not a Time) object. This error is likely occurring within the function column_op, specifically in the cases where it tries to perform an operation involving a numpy array and a NaTType object.

To fix this issue, we need to handle the case where a NaTType object is encountered and perform an appropriate operation.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is by adding a condition to handle NaTType objects in the column_op function. This condition should check for NaTType objects and handle them appropriately without causing the unsupported operand type(s) error.

Additionally, it may be necessary to handle the case where a NaTType is encountered in the evaluate function in expressions.py.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function dispatch_to_series:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = pd.to_numeric(right, errors='coerce')  # Convert NaT to NaN
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not pd.isna(b) else b for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    # ... other cases remain the same ...

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected code, the column_op function now checks for NaT (converted to NaN) and handles it appropriately by not performing the operation if the second operand is NaN.

This should resolve the unsupported operand type(s) error and make the function pass the failing test.
