1. The function `dispatch_to_series` is designed to evaluate a frame operation by dispatching to the Series implementation column-by-column. It takes in parameters such as `left` (DataFrame), `right` (scalar or DataFrame), `func` (arithmetic or comparison operator), `str_rep` (string or None), and `axis` (axis to perform the operation along). The function then tries to determine the type of `right` and performs the operation accordingly.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the conditional statements that determine the type of `right` and the subsequent operations to be performed based on its type.

3. The only mention of potential error is the `NotImplementedError` that is raised if the type of `right` does not match any of the conditions.

4. Possible approach for fixing the bug:
   - Update the conditional statements to correctly identify the type of `right` and perform the operations accordingly.
   - Add a default case to handle any other type of `right` that is not explicitly covered in the conditional statements.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
import numpy as np
from pandas.core.dtypes.generic import ABCDataFrame, ABCSeries
from pandas.core import common as lib

def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    # If right is a scalar or a DataFrame
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    # If right is a DataFrame
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    # If right is a Series and axis is "columns"
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    # If right is a Series
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        # Handle other cases later
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        # Add a default case to handle any other type of right
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```
In the corrected code, the conditional statements have been updated to correctly identify the type of `right` and perform the operations accordingly. Additionally, a default case has been added to handle any other type of `right` that is not explicitly covered in the conditional statements.
