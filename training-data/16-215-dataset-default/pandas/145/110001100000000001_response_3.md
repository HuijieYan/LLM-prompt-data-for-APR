The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is responsible for evaluating the frame operation `func(left, right)` by dispatching to the Series implementation column-by-column. The potential error location within the problematic function is the definition of the `column_op` function within the conditions for different types of `right` inputs.

The bug's cause is that the `column_op` function is redefined multiple times within different conditions, which can lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect evaluation of the DataFrame operation.

To fix the bug, we can define the `column_op` function outside of the `dispatch_to_series` function and then call it with the appropriate arguments based on the conditions. This will ensure that `column_op` is defined only once and used correctly within the different conditions.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/ops/__init__.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def column_op_scalar(a, b, func):
    return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def column_op_dataframe(a, b, func):
    return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def column_op_series_rows(a, b, func):
    return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def column_op_series(a, b, func):
    return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        column_op = column_op_dataframe
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        column_op = column_op_series_rows

``` 

In the corrected code, the `column_op` functions are defined outside of the `dispatch_to_series` function, and the appropriate `column_op` function is assigned based on the conditions. This will ensure that `column_op` is defined only once and used correctly within the different conditions.
