The issue with the buggy function is that it is trying to use a scalar value in a calculation that should be performed on entire columns or rows. This is causing the function to fail, as it is unable to handle this scenario properly.

To fix this bug, we should modify the function to handle the different types of input values correctly. Specifically, we should handle the case of a scalar or Series input separately from the case of a DataFrame input.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas as pd
    
    if isinstance(right, pd.Series):
        if axis == "columns":
            new_data = left.apply(lambda column: func(column, right), axis=0)
        else:
            new_data = left.apply(lambda row: func(row, right), axis=1)
    elif isinstance(right, pd.DataFrame):
        if axis == "columns":
            new_data = left.apply(lambda column: func(column, right[column.name]), axis=0)
        else:
            new_data = left.apply(lambda row: func(row, right.loc[row.name]), axis=1)
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    return new_data
```

This corrected code should handle the different types of input values correctly and provide the expected output for the given cases.
