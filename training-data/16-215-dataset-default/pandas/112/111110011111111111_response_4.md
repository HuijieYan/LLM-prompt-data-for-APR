The bug seems to be occurring in the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class. The failing test is related to the `round` method failing when the columns are of type `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. The error message indicates a `TypeError: No matching signature found` when the `df.round()` method is called.

Upon analyzing the code, it seems that the bug is likely caused by the `get_indexer` method not handling the `CategoricalIndex` properly. This is evident from the failing test case, where the columns are of type `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`.

To fix the bug, the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class needs to properly handle cases where the input is a `CategoricalIndex`. It should appropriately handle the `CategoricalIndex` and perform the required operations without raising a `TypeError`.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target: AnyIndex, method: Optional[str] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:
    # Handle CategoricalIndex
    if isinstance(target, CategoricalIndex):
        target_as_index = target._codes
    else:
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged

```

By handling the `CategoricalIndex` in the `get_indexer` method, the issue should be resolved. This updated code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
