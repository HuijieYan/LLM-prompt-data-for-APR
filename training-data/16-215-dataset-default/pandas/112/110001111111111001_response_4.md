The buggy function is `get_indexer` in the `pandas/core/indexes/interval.py` file. The function is trying to use the `_engine` attribute, which should refer to an instance of a class that supports the `get_indexer` method, but it is being called as if it were a method.

The failing test is `test_round_interval_category_columns` in the `pandas/tests/frame/test_analytics.py` file. The error message indicates that there is a TypeError with the line `indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)`.

Based on the input parameters and the failing test, it seems that the `_engine` attribute is not being used correctly and is causing a TypeError when trying to call the `get_indexer` method.

To fix this bug, the usage of the `_engine` attribute needs to be corrected. It should be used as an instance attribute and called as a method to access the `get_indexer` functionality.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")

        # different closed or incompatible subtype -> no matches
        common_subtype = find_common_type(
            [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
        )
        if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

        # non-overlapping -> at most one match per interval in target_as_index
        # want exact matches -> need both left/right to match, so defer to
        # left/right get_indexer, compare elementwise, equality -> match
        left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
        right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
        indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        # heterogeneous scalar index: defer elementwise to get_loc
        # (non-overlapping so get_loc guarantees scalar of KeyError)
        indexer = []
        for key in target_as_index:
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError:
                loc = -1
            indexer.append(loc)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected code, the `_engine` attribute is used as an instance attribute and called as a method using `self._engine.get_indexer` to access the `get_indexer` functionality. Additionally, the `is_overlapping` method is called as `self.is_overlapping()` to obtain the boolean result. This change should fix the TypeError and allow the failing test to pass.
