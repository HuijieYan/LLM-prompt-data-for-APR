The potential error location within the problematic function is in the section that handles the case when `target_as_index` is an instance of `IntervalIndex`. This section contains several conditional statements that manipulate the `target_as_index` and try to find matches with the `self` object. Based on the provided input/output variable information, it seems that the manipulation of `target_as_index` and the subsequent comparisons are not producing the expected results, leading to incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we can approach it by thoroughly reviewing and debugging the conditional statements within the section that handles `IntervalIndex` instances. Specifically, we should carefully check the conditions being used for comparisons and ensure that the logic accurately captures the intended behavior for matching and indexing.

Additionally, it's important to review the type and value of the variables being used in comparisons and manipulations during this section to ensure that they align with the expected behavior based on the input parameters.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        elif self.closed != target_as_index.closed or self.dtype != target_as_index.dtype:
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
        else:
            indexer = []
            for i in range(len(target_as_index)):
                if target_as_index.left[i] in self.left and target_as_index.right[i] in self.right:
                    indexer.append(i)
                else:
                    indexer.append(-1)
            return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
    else:
        indexer = []
        for key in target_as_index:
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError:
                loc = -1
            indexer.append(loc)

        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected code, the section that handles `IntervalIndex` instances has been modified to incorporate additional conditions for matching and indexing. The logic has been adjusted to ensure that comparisons and manipulations align with the expected behavior based on the input parameters. Additionally, the comparisons now explicitly check for equality of `self.closed` and `self.dtype` with the corresponding attributes of `target_as_index`, and the indexing process has been revised to accurately identify matches.
