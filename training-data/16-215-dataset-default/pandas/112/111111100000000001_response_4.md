1. The buggy function is part of the IntervalIndex class and is used to generate the indexer for a given target. It calls several related functions from the same class and other functions from the same file to perform its operations.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely where it checks for overlapping indices and attempts to handle different scenarios based on the type of target index.

3. (a) The buggy function attempts to handle overlapping indices and different types of target indices, but the logic seems to be problematic.
   (b) The IntervalIndex class contains multiple related functions that are responsible for handling various aspects of generating the indexer.
   (c) The related functions from the same file are used to check for overlapping indices, handle different types of target indices, and ensure the correct indexing based on the target.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Review and simplify the logic for handling different types of target indices.
   - Ensure that the handling of overlapping indices is done correctly.
   - Verify that the indexer is being generated accurately for all scenarios.

5. Corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")

        common_subtype = find_common_type(
            [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
        )
        if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

        left_indexer = self.left().get_indexer(target_as_index.left())
        right_indexer = self.right().get_indexer(target_as_index.right())
        indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine().get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        indexer = [self.get_loc(key) for key in target_as_index]

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected code, the function `is_overlapping` is correctly called as a method by using parentheses, and related functions such as `left`, `right`, `maybe_convert_i8`, and `_engine` are also called as methods by using parentheses. Additionally, the logic for handling different types of target indices has been reviewed and simplified to ensure accurate generation of the indexer.
