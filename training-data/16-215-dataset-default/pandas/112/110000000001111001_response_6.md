The potential error in the buggy function seems to be in the section where it checks for the type of the target_as_index and then performs different operations based on the type. The code may not be handling the cases correctly based on the type of the target_as_index.

The discrepancy lies in the fact that the code is not appropriately handling the different cases for the type of target_as_index, leading to incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we can refactor the code to handle the different cases for the type of target_as_index more appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        else:
            indexer = np.zeros(len(target_as_index), dtype="intp") - 1
            for i, (start, end) in enumerate(target_as_index):
                for j, (self_start, self_end) in enumerate(self):
                    if start == self_start and end == self_end:
                        indexer[i] = j
        return indexer
    else:
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In this corrected code, we have removed the unnecessary checks and refactored the logic to handle the different cases of the type of target_as_index appropriately. This should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
