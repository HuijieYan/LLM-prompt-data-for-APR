The potential error location within the problematic function appears to be in the `get_indexer` method, particularly in the line where it calls `self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)`. The error message indicates a "No matching signature found" TypeError, which suggests that there might be an issue with the method signature or the way the `target_as_index.values` is being passed to `self._engine.get_indexer()`.

The failing test is related to the `round` method failing on a DataFrame with columns that are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. This suggests that the bug is likely related to how the `get_indexer` function is handling IntervalIndex and CategoricalIndex.

The GitHub issue title and description further support the conclusion that the bug is occurring when using CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex in the `round` method.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
1. Reviewing the method signature and ensuring that it is compatible with the input data types.
2. Checking how IntervalIndex and CategoricalIndex are being handled within the `get_indexer` method.
3. Ensuring that the `round` method is correctly handling the specific data types involved.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise NotImplementedError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        else:
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    else:
        # Handle the case when target_as_index is not an IntervalIndex
        return np.array([])  # or perform any other appropriate handling
```

This corrected code includes handling the cases for when `target_as_index` is an IntervalIndex and provides a basic fallback for other cases. However, the specific handling for non-IntervalIndex cases will depend on the desired behavior for the `get_indexer` function. This code aims to resolve the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
