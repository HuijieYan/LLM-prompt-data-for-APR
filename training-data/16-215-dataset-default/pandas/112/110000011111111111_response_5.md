Based on the failing test, error message, and GitHub issue, it seems that the bug is related to the `get_indexer` method when the columns are of type `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. The error message indicates a `TypeError: No matching signature found`, which suggests that there is an issue with the method signature or argument types.

The expected input and output variable values provided in the failing test indicate that the `get_indexer` method is unable to handle the `target_as_index.values` due to an incorrect signature or argument type.

The GitHub issue also confirms this by stating that when the `columns` are of type `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`, the `round` method fails. The issue also provides an example of when this problem arises, further emphasizing the significance of the bug.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to update the `get_indexer` method to handle the `target_as_index.values` correctly, especially when the index is of type `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    if isinstance(target, CategoricalIndex):
        target_as_index = target.categories
    else:
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    # rest of the method remains unchanged
    # ...
```

In this corrected code, when the `target` is of type `CategoricalIndex`, the `categories` attribute is used to obtain the underlying index values. This ensures that the `get_indexer` method can handle the values correctly, addressing the bug.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and successfully resolve the GitHub issue.
