The bug is located in the `get_indexer` function. The error message indicates a `TypeError` with no matching signature found. The failing test provided also shows that the `round` method fails when the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`, leading to the `TypeError`.

The buggy function attempts to handle different cases based on the type of the `target_as_index`. However, there are issues with the way it handles the different cases, leading to the `TypeError` being raised.

The potential causes of the bug are:
- Incorrect handling of the `target_as_index` when it is an `IntervalIndex`
- Mishandling of the dtype and closed properties when comparing `IntervalIndex` objects
- Incorrect implementation in the else block when the `target_as_index` is of type `object`

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the different cases when `target_as_index` is an `IntervalIndex`, ensuring that the correct comparisons are made and the correct actions are taken based on the type of index.

The corrected code for the `get_indexer` function is provided below:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        else:
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        return self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index)
    else:
        indexer = []
        for key in target_as_index:
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
                indexer.append(loc)
            except KeyError:
                indexer.append(-1)
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

This corrected code properly handles the different cases when `target_as_index` is an `IntervalIndex` or a different index type. It ensures that the comparisons are made correctly and the appropriate actions are taken based on the type of index. This should resolve the issue when using the `round` method with `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.
