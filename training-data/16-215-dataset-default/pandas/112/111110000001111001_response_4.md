The bug in the `get_indexer` function seems to be related to the conditional check `if self.is_overlapping`. The bug appears to be caused by comparing a method to a boolean value directly, which may not give the desired result. Additionally, the comparison is missing parentheses, which could be causing unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct comparison is made for the `is_overlapping` attribute, and that the comparison is properly enclosed within parentheses.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function:

```python
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():  # Corrected the comparison to call the method
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    # The rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

By making the correction above, the comparison should now properly check if the `is_overlapping` method returns `True` or `False`, and the function should work as expected with the provided input/output variable information.
