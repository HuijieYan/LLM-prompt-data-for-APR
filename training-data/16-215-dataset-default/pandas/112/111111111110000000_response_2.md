The error message indicates that there's an issue with the `get_indexer` method. It seems that the method signature is incorrect. To fix this, we need to modify the method signature to match the expected input and output types.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target: np.ndarray, method: Optional[str] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    # Rest of the method remains unchanged
    # ...
```

With this correction, the method should now correctly accept an `np.ndarray` as the `target` input and return an `np.ndarray` as the output. This should resolve the TypeError reported in the failing test.
