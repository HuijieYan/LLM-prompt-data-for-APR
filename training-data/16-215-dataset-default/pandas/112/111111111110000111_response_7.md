The bug is occurring in the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class when the columns are of type `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`. This is causing a TypeError with no matching signature found.

The potential error is likely occurring in the logic that handles the `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. The code is failing to handle the `CategoricalIndex` properly, which is leading to the TypeError.

The bug's cause is related to how the `get_indexer` method is interacting with the `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`. The method is not handling this specific scenario properly, resulting in the TypeError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
1. Modifying the logic in the `get_indexer` method to properly handle the `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`.
2. Checking the method signatures and ensuring that they are compatible with the input types, including `CategoricalIndex` from `IntervalIndex`.
3. Updating the logic to handle the specific scenario of using `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex` in the `get_indexer` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method:

```python
# Import the necessary modules for the fix
from pandas.api.types import CategoricalDtype

# This is the corrected get_indexer method
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if isinstance(target, CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target.dtype, CategoricalDtype):
        # Handle CategoricalIndex differently
        indexer = target.codes
    else:
        # Original logic for non-CategoricalIndex
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

This corrected code for the `get_indexer` method includes a check for `CategoricalIndex` and handles it differently by extracting the codes. This should resolve the TypeError when using `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`.

By replacing the buggy `get_indexer` method with this corrected code, it should pass the failing test and successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
