Potential error location: The bug might be caused by the if statement `if self.is_overlapping`, as it seems to be checking whether the IntervalIndex is overlapping. However, the condition `if self.is_overlapping:` does not actually call the `is_overlapping` method, it checks if the method exists. This might be causing the bug.

Bug's Cause:
The buggy function `get_indexer` within the `IntervalIndex` class is not accurately checking for overlapping indices. The condition `if self.is_overlapping:` is not correctly calling the method and is instead checking if the method exists. This is likely leading to incorrect handling of overlapping indices and failing to return the expected results.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Call the `is_overlapping` method instead of just checking if it exists.
2. Ensure that the correct comparisons and checks are being performed to accurately identify overlapping indices and handle them appropriately.

Corrected Code:
```python
# this is the corrected get_indexer function
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    # rest of the function's code remains the same
    ...
```
In this corrected code, the `is_overlapping` method is being called with parentheses `self.is_overlapping()` to correctly evaluate whether the current IntervalIndex is overlapping, addressing the potential bug in the original implementation.
