The bug in the `get_indexer` function seems to be related to the handling of IntervalIndex when used within a CategoricalIndex. The function is not properly handling this scenario, which results in a TypeError when trying to round the DataFrame.

The issue seems to be caused by the function not correctly handling the case where the target index is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. This leads to a mismatch and results in a TypeError when trying to use the round method on the DataFrame.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle the case where the target index is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. This will involve adjusting the logic to properly handle the mismatch and allow the round method to work as expected.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function that addresses the issue:

```python
# Fix for the buggy function
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if isinstance(target, CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target.categories, IntervalIndex):
        target_as_index = target.categories
    else:
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    # Rest of the code remains the same
    # ...

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

This fix addresses the issue by checking if the target index is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, and then setting the target_as_index to the IntervalIndex in that case. This ensures that the function handles this scenario correctly and should allow the round method to work as expected.
