The bug in the function is caused by the incorrect use of `self.is_overlapping` as a property instead of a method call. The condition `if self.is_overlapping` should be `if self.is_overlapping()` to call the method and check the result.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated as follows:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@Substitution(
        **dict(
            _index_doc_kwargs,
            **{
                "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                    """
        Raises
        ------
        NotImplementedError
            If any method argument other than the default of
            None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
        """
                )
            },
        )
    )
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

        self._check_method(method)

        if self.is_overlapping():
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

        # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

This change ensures that the `is_overlapping` method is called properly, allowing the condition to be evaluated correctly.
