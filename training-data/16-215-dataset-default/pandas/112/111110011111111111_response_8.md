The bug is being caused by the `get_indexer` method in the `IntervalIndex` class. The failing test is trying to call the `round` method on a DataFrame with columns that are a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, and this is causing a TypeError to be raised.

The bug is likely occurring in the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class, where the `TypeError: No matching signature found` is being raised. This indicates that there is an issue with the signature of the method.

In the failing test, the columns are being created using `pd.CategoricalIndex(pd.interval_range(0, 2))`, which creates a CategoricalIndex based on an IntervalIndex. This is triggering the bug in the `get_indexer` method.

To fix this bug, the signature of the `get_indexer` method needs to be updated to correctly handle the case where the target index is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.

The corrected code for the `get_indexer` method in the `IntervalIndex` class is as follows:

```python
def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping():
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target_as_index.categories, IntervalIndex):
            # Handle the case where the target is a CategoricalIndex based on an IntervalIndex
            indexer = target_as_index.categories.get_indexer(target_as_index)
        else:
            # Handle other cases
            indexer = super().get_indexer(
                target, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance
            )
    
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

This updated `get_indexer` method explicitly handles the case where the target is a CategoricalIndex based on an IntervalIndex and delegates to the appropriate method to handle this case.

With this correction, the failing test should pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
