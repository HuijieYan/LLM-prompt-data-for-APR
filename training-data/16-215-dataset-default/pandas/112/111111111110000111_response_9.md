The buggy function in question is the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class. The failing test `test_round_interval_category_columns` is trying to round a DataFrame with columns of type `CategoricalIndex` which are created from an `IntervalIndex`. This call fails with a TypeError: "No matching signature found."

The cause of the bug lies in the implementation of the `get_indexer` method. It appears that there might be a mismatch in the signature of the method, causing the TypeError to be raised.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to revisit the signature and implementation of the `get_indexer` method. It is likely that the method's signature is not matching the expected types of input data, thus resulting in the TypeError. 

Additionally, it may be necessary to review the compatibility of the `get_indexer` method with columns of type `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target: Any, method: Optional[str] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None,
                tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        raise NotImplementedError("Overlapping indices not supported")

    if isinstance(target, IntervalIndex):
        result = super().get_indexer(target, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)
    else:
        result = self.values.get_indexer(target, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)

    return result
```

This corrected code explicitly checks for instances of `IntervalIndex`, and then calls the `get_indexer` method accordingly. This should resolve the issue identified in the failing test and also address the problem outlined in the GitHub issue.
