The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the handling of IntervalIndex and CategoricalIndex. The GitHub issue also indicates that there is a problem with the `round` method when columns are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.

Based on the provided runtime value and type of variables, it seems that the problem lies in the handling of the `target_as_index` variable, particularly when it is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.

The cause of the bug could be that the function does not handle the CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex correctly, leading to the TypeError when using the `round` method.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the case when `target_as_index` is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex in the `get_indexer` function. It may also require checking the `dtype` of `target_as_index` to determine the correct course of action.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex) or isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex):
        if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex):
            target_as_index = target_as_index.categories
                
        # rest of the code remains unchanged

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In this corrected code, we added a condition to handle the case when `target_as_index` is a CategoricalIndex. We are extracting the categories from the CategoricalIndex and then continuing with the same logic as for the IntervalIndex.

This correction should address the issue raised in the GitHub report and handle the CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex correctly.
