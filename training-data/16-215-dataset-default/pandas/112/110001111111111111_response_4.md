The bug is likely located in the `get_indexer` function of the `IntervalIndex` class. The failing test is related to using the `round` method on a DataFrame with columns as `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`, which leads to a `TypeError` with no matching signature found.

The potential cause of the bug is that the `get_indexer` method is failing to handle the `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`, resulting in a `TypeError`.

To fix the bug:
1. The `get_indexer` method should be updated to handle the case where the target is a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.
2. The method should be modified to return the correct indexer for the input values and handle the `IntervalIndex` fields appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:
    if isinstance(target, CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target.categories, IntervalIndex):
        return target.categories.get_indexer(target)
    else:
        self._check_method(method)
        
        # Existing code for handling non-IntervalIndex targets
```

This updated `get_indexer` function now checks if the target is a `CategoricalIndex` with categories of type `IntervalIndex`. If so, it directly returns the indexer using the `get_indexer` method of the categories. Otherwise, it continues to handle non-IntervalIndex targets using the existing code.

With this fix, the `TypeError` issue should be resolved, and the failing test should pass successfully.

After making these changes, the bug can be verified as fixed, and the corrected code can be submitted in response to the GitHub issue.
