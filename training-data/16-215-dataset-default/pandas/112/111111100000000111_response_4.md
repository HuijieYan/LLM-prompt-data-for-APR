The buggy function in the provided code is `get_indexer`. The function is a method of the `IntervalIndex` class and it is responsible for returning the index labels for a given target. The function checks for overlapping indices, handles different types of target indexes, and returns the index positions based on the target.

The GitHub issue mentions that the `round` method fails when the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. This indicates that there might be an issue with how the `get_indexer` function handles different types of indexes.

The potential error location within the `get_indexer` function could be the handling of different types of target indexes, specifically `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the handling of different types of indexes and the conversion of target indexes.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to properly handle `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. This could involve implementing specific logic for this type of index conversion and handling.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
    if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target_as_index.categories, IntervalIndex):
        target_as_index = target_as_index.categories

    # Rest of the function remains the same

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In this corrected code, a check is added to handle `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. If the target index is of this type, we extract the `IntervalIndex` from the `CategoricalIndex` and proceed with the rest of the function as usual.

This correction should address the issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report.
