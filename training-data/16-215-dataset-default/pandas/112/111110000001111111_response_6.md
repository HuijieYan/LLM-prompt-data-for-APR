The issue is related to the round method failing when columns are a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. The problematic function is the get_indexer method of the IntervalIndex class. The actual input/output variable information shows that the method is failing to handle CategoricalIndex columns, resulting in a TypeError. The GitHub issue confirms this behavior, stating that the round method fails when using columns with CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.

The potential error location within the get_indexer method is where it checks the type of the target_as_index. It fails to properly handle the case when target_as_index is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.

The cause of the bug is that the get_indexer method does not properly handle the case when the target_as_index is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. This leads to a TypeError when using the round method on a DataFrame with such columns.

To fix the bug, the get_indexer method needs to be updated to properly handle the case when the target_as_index is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. This can be done by adding a conditional statement to handle this specific case.

Here is the corrected code for the get_indexer method:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if isinstance(target, CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target.categories, IntervalIndex):
        # Handle the case when the target is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex
        target_as_index = target.categories
    else:
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    # Rest of the method remains unchanged
    # ...
```

With this updated code, the get_indexer method will handle the case when the target is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, and the round method should work as expected for such columns. This will resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
