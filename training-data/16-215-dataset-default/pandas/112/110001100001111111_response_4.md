The potential error in the buggy function lies in the conditional check for `self.is_overlapping`. The buggy function checks `if self.is_overlapping:` but it should be `if self.is_overlapping():` to invoke the `is_overlapping` method.

The bug's cause is using `self.is_overlapping` as a property instead of calling it as a method. This results in the conditional being evaluated as True because the property itself exists, causing the code to take the wrong branch.

To fix the bug, the correct approach is to call the `is_overlapping` method instead of treating it as a property.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():  # Call the method here
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
```

With this correction, the code should correctly handle the case where `self.is_overlapping` should be called as a method.

This should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug, where the round method fails whenever the columns are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. The corrected code should ensure that round method works as expected for such columns.
