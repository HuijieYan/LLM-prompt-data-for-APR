The bug in the function is caused by the condition `if self.is_overlapping`. The variable `is_overlapping` is a method of the `IntervalIndex` class, and in the context of the function, it should be called as a method using parentheses `self.is_overlapping()`. As it stands, the condition is always evaluating to `True`, leading to the code inside this block being executed when it shouldn't be.

To fix the bug, the condition `if self.is_overlapping` should be changed to `if self.is_overlapping()`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():  # Fixed the method call
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```
With this correction, the function should now behave correctly and handle the `is_overlapping` condition as intended.
