The bug in the given code seems to be the missing implementation of the `get_indexer` function. The function is supposed to return an array of index positions for the target elements. However, the implementation seems to be faulty as it is not handling all the cases correctly.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the handling of different cases for `target_as_index`. It seems that the function is not handling all cases properly, leading to incorrect output.

The bug's cause is derived from the discrepancies between the expected and actual input/output variable values. The function is not properly handling the different types of `target_as_index`, leading to incorrect results.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Implementing proper handling for different types of `target_as_index` to ensure correct index positions are returned.
2. Ensuring that overlapping indices are properly handled, as the current implementation raises an error for overlapping indices.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        return self.get_indexer_non_unique(target)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")

        if self.closed != target_as_index.closed:
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

        left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
        right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
        indexer = np.where((left_indexer == right_indexer) & (left_indexer != -1), left_indexer, -1)

    else:
        indexer = np.empty(len(target_as_index), dtype=np.intp)
        indexer.fill(-1)
        for i, val in enumerate(target_as_index):
            try:
                indexer[i] = self.get_loc(val)
            except KeyError:
                pass

    return indexer
```

In the corrected code, we ensure proper handling of different cases for `target_as_index` and also handle overlapping indices by calling the `get_indexer_non_unique` function when necessary. Additionally, we handle the comparisons and assignment of index positions appropriately.
