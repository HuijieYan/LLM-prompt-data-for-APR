The issue in the code is that the `get_indexer` function is being defined twice in the same file. To fix this issue, we need to remove the duplicate definition of the `get_indexer` function and correct the annotations.

Here's the corrected version of the code:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/interval.py

# ... (other function definitions remain unchanged)

# Remove the duplicate definition of the get_indexer function 

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        # Note the added parentheses to call the is_overlapping function
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")

       # ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)

```

The changes made include removing the duplicate definition of the `get_indexer` function, and adding parentheses to `self.is_overlapping` to call the `is_overlapping` function.

Please note that the `is_overlapping` is assumed to be an instance method, so it should be called as `self.is_overlapping()`. If it's a class method, the call should be adjusted accordingly.
