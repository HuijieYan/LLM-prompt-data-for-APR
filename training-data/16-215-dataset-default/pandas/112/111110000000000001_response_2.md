1. The `get_indexer` function is part of the `IntervalIndex` class in the provided code. This class represents an immutable index of intervals that are closed on the same side. The `get_indexer` function is used to obtain indexers that allow certain operations to be aligned on the intervals in the index. It calls other methods within the same class to perform its operations.

2. The potential error location in the problematic function is likely the condition `if self.is_overlapping:`. This might not be evaluating the condition correctly or might be missing a method call to retrieve the attribute `is_overlapping`.

3. Error Cause:
   (a) In the `get_indexer` function, the condition `if self.is_overlapping:` is used to determine if the index can handle overlapping indices. However, there might be an issue with how `is_overlapping` is being evaluated or accessed within the class.
   (b) It seems that the `is_overlapping` attribute or method is missing from the class, and hence, the condition is not being properly checked.

4. Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
   - Check if the `is_overlapping` attribute or method is defined within the class and if it is being properly accessed in the `get_indexer` function.
   - If the attribute or method is missing, it needs to be defined in the class to properly check for overlapping indices.

5. Corrected Code:
```python
# The corrected version of the `get_indexer` function
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)

    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,

    # Check for overlapping indices
    if self._has_overlapping_indices():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    # rest of the function remains unchanged

def _has_overlapping_indices(self) -> bool:
    # Add a new method to check if the index has overlapping indices
    # Implement the logic to check for overlapping indices and return a boolean
    # For example:
    return any(abs(j - i) < self._MAX_OVERLAP for i, j in zip(self.left, self.right))

# Define a constant for maximum allowed overlap
# This is a hypothetical constant and can be adjusted based on requirements
IntervalIndex._MAX_OVERLAP = 0
```
In the corrected code, a new method `_has_overlapping_indices` is added to the `IntervalIndex` class to properly check if the index has overlapping indices. This method implements the logic to check for overlapping indices and returns a boolean value. Additionally, a constant `_MAX_OVERLAP` is defined to specify the maximum allowed overlap, and it is used in the `_has_overlapping_indices` method. The `get_indexer` function now makes use of this `_has_overlapping_indices` method to determine if overlapping indices are present.
