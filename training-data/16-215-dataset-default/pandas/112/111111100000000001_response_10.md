The buggy function is `get_indexer` and it is a method of the class `IntervalIndex`. This class extends the `Index` class and contains various helper methods such as `left`, `right`, `closed`, `values`, `dtype`, `is_overlapping`, `_maybe_convert_i8`, `_check_method`, `get_loc`, `get_indexer`, `where`, and `equals`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely around the logic for handling overlapping and non-overlapping indices. The code seems to be handling different cases, such as equal indexes, different closed or incompatible subtypes, non-overlapping indices, and handling scalar indices. It is possible that the bug is caused by incorrect handling of these cases, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, it is recommended to review the logic for handling overlapping and non-overlapping indices and ensure that the code correctly handles each case. Additionally, thorough testing of the function with different types of input data, including overlapping and non-overlapping indices, should be performed to ensure the correctness of the fixed code.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    # rest of the function remains the same
```

In the corrected version, the `is_overlapping` method is called as a function with `self.is_overlapping()`, which will correctly check for overlapping indices. Additionally, the rest of the logic remains unchanged. This fix should address the potential issue of mishandling overlapping indices and provide an improved and functional implementation of the `get_indexer` method.
