The issue here is that the `get_indexer` function is being defined twice in the `IntervalIndex` class, which is causing a conflict. One of the definitions also includes a different signature for the function, which is not matching the expected signature in the failing test.

To fix this issue, the redundant definition of the `get_indexer` function should be removed and the signature of the remaining `get_indexer` function should match the expected signature in the failing test.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    
    self._check_method(method)
    
    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
    ...  # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With this correction, the function should no longer have a conflict, and the failing test should pass.
