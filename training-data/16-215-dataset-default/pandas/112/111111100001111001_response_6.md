The potential error in the buggy function lies in the condition `if self.is_overlapping:`. The intention seems to be to check the value of the `is_overlapping` method, but the code is instead treating it as an attribute by not including parentheses at the end and is therefore always evaluating as True. This causes the function to always raise an `InvalidIndexError` even when it shouldn't.

To fix the bug, the condition should be `if self.is_overlapping():` to properly call the method.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)
    
    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
  
    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
```

By making this change, the function will now properly check for overlapping indices and only raise the `InvalidIndexError` when necessary.
