Potential Error Location:
The potential error location within the problematic function is the condition `if self.is_overlapping`, as it seems to be the trigger for the issue. 

Bug's Cause:
(a). The buggy function attempts to check if `self` has overlapping intervals using `self.is_overlapping`. This check is intended to handle overlapping indices differently, but it does not seem to be functioning as expected.
(b). The class `IntervalIndex` contains methods and attributes such as `left`, `right`, `closed`, and `is_overlapping` that are used within the buggy function.
(c). The GitHub issue describes an error occurring when the `round` method is used on a DataFrame with `CategoricalIndex` columns created from an `IntervalIndex`. This aligns with the behavior of the `get_indexer` method, which handles indexing of overlapping intervals, suggesting a correlation between the two.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the check for overlapping indices to ensure it functions as intended.
2. Verify the behavior of the `get_indexer` method and its interaction with `CategoricalIndex` columns created from an `IntervalIndex`.
3. Test the functionality of the `round` method with `CategoricalIndex` columns to identify any issues.

Corrected Code:
```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    # Check for overlapping indices
    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "Cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    # Rest of the function code remains unchanged
```
In the corrected code, the `is_overlapping` method is called as a function `self.is_overlapping()` to properly check for overlapping indices. This should ensure that the condition is evaluated correctly.

Additionally, further testing is necessary to validate the interactions between the `get_indexer` method and `CategoricalIndex` columns created from an `IntervalIndex`, and ensure that the `round` method functions as expected in the provided GitHub issue.
