Potential error location within the problematic function:
The issue in the buggy function occurs when it tries to handle CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. This results in a TypeError when the `round` method is called.

Bug's cause:
The bug is caused by the get_indexer method not handling the CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex correctly. This leads to the TypeError when the `round` method is called on a DataFrame with such columns.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check for the CategoricalIndex type and handle it separately within the get_indexer method.
2. Ensure that the get_indexer method can properly handle categorical data and IntervalIndex columns.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:

    if isinstance(target, pd.CategoricalIndex):
        # Handle CategoricalIndex separately
        indexer = target.get_indexer(self)
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)

    self._check_method(method)

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = ("cannot handle overlapping indices; use IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique")
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
```

This corrected code checks for the CategoricalIndex type and handles it separately within the get_indexer method, ensuring that it can properly handle categorical data and IntervalIndex columns.

With this corrected code, the get_indexer method should be able to handle CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex properly, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
