The issue in the provided code seems to be related to a wrong signature in the `get_indexer` function. It is trying to take a single parameter of type `scalar_t[:]`, which is causing a `TypeError` due to no matching signature found.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)
    
    # existing code...
```

In this corrected version, the decorator `@Substitution` which was causing the issue is removed, as it doesn't seem to be directly related to the `get_indexer` function. The signature of the `get_indexer` function is also adjusted to avoid the `TypeError` mentioned in the failing test.

These changes should help fix the issue.
