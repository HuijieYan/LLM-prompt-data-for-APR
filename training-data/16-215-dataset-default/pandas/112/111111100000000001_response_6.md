The buggy function is `get_indexer` within the `IntervalIndex` class. This function is responsible for getting the indexer for a target array-like input based on certain conditions. It interacts with other functions within the same class to handle different scenarios such as overlapping indices, different closed intervals, and scalar indices.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic that handles the case when `self.is_overlapping`. This condition appears to be a typo, as it should be a method call `self.is_overlapping()`. This could be causing unexpected behavior in the function.

The bug's cause is that the conditional check `if self.is_overlapping` is incorrect. It should be `if self.is_overlapping()` to call the method and receive its result, rather than checking if the method itself exists.

To fix the bug, the logical error in the conditional check `if self.is_overlapping` needs to be corrected to `if self.is_overlapping()`. Additionally, any other coding standards and best practices should be followed to ensure the function operates correctly.

Corrected code:

```python
# Other functions remain unchanged

# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    # Remaining logic of the function...
```
In the corrected code, the `self.is_overlapping` is changed to `self.is_overlapping()`, which is the correct way to call the method and evaluate its result. This change should fix the bug in the function.
