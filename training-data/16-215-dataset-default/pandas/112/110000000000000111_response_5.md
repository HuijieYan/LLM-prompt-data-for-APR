1. The buggy function `get_indexer` is a method that seems to be a part of a larger codebase, possibly related to indexing and accessing data in Python. The GitHub issue titled "round method fails when columns are CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex" indicates that there is an issue with rounding when using a specific type of index, `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely related to the handling of the index types, especially when checking for overlapping indices and converting them to different types.

3. (a) The buggy function `get_indexer` is likely responsible for the type mismatch and rounding error when using a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. There may be a specific condition or handling of index types that is causing the rounding error.

   (b) The GitHub issue mentions that the `round` method fails when the columns are `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. This provides additional information that the bug specifically affects the `round` method, potentially due to how the index types are handled within the code.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Checking for the specific condition that causes the `round` method to fail when using `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.
   - Ensuring that the handling of index types within the `get_indexer` function is compatible with the `round` method.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function `get_indexer`:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, (IntervalIndex, CategoricalIndex)):
        target_as_index = target_as_index._shallow_copy(other=np.asarray(target_as_index))
    
    # rest of the original code...
```

In the corrected code, we have added a check to handle the case when the `target_as_index` is an `IntervalIndex` or a `CategoricalIndex`. By converting the `CategoricalIndex` to an array, we ensure compatibility with the `round` method. This amendment should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub issue.
