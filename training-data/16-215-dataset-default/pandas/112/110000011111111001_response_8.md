The error message indicates a type error related to the `get_indexer` method. The `get_indexer` method is being called with a `scalar_t[:]` type, and the error indicates that no matching signature was found.

The buggy function is the `get_indexer` method, and the failing test is trying to round a DataFrame with interval category columns. The error message indicates that the `get_indexer` method is not matching the expected signature, leading to a type error.

The expected behavior of the `get_indexer` method seems to be returning an indexer based on the target values, but the actual implementation does not match the expected behavior, leading to a type error.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `get_indexer` method handles the input signature correctly and returns the appropriate indexer based on the target values.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # Handle the case of IntervalIndex separately
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index)
    else:
        # For other types, handle them based on the existing implementation
        if not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
        else:
            indexer = []
            for key in target_as_index:
                try:
                    loc = self.get_loc(key)
                except KeyError:
                    loc = -1
                indexer.append(loc)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected code, we handle the case of `IntervalIndex` separately by calling the `_engine.get_indexer` method with the `target_as_index`. For other types, we retain the existing behavior based on the input type.

This corrected code should address the type error and align the behavior of the `get_indexer` method with the expected input/output variable values.
