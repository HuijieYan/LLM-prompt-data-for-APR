The buggy function `get_indexer` is failing due to a TypeError: No matching signature found. This error is occurring because of the incorrect usage of `scalar_t[:]` in the function definition. This syntax is not recognized and is causing the TypeError.

To fix this bug, the `get_indexer` function definition needs to be corrected. The `scalar_t[:]` should be replaced with the correct type annotation. Additionally, the corrected `get_indexer` function should handle the rounding of interval category columns as the failing test `test_round_interval_category_columns` indicates.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:
    # existing code

    if not isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex) and isinstance(target_as_index, pd.CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target_as_index.categories, pd.IntervalIndex):
        # handling rounding of interval category columns
        target_as_index.categories = target_as_index.categories.round()

    # existing code

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

With this correction, the function should now be able to handle the rounding of interval category columns as indicated in the failing test. Additionally, it should remove the TypeError: No matching signature found and pass the failing test with the expected output.

This change should also resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to the failing test, as the corrected function will now handle the rounding of interval category columns, fulfilling the expected output.
