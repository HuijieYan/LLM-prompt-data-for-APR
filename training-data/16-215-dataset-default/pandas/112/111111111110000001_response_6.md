The buggy function is `get_indexer` which is part of the `IntervalIndex` class. The failing test `test_round_interval_category_columns` is trying to round a DataFrame that has an `IntervalIndex` as columns. When the `round` function is called on the DataFrame, it eventually tries to call the `get_indexer` method on the `IntervalIndex` columns, which results in a `TypeError` due to no matching signature found.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the signature of the `get_indexer` method. It seems that the signature `def get_indexer(self, scalar_t[:] target):` is causing the `TypeError` as no matching signature is found.

The bug's cause is that the signature of the `get_indexer` method is not compatible with the way it is being called when trying to round the DataFrame. This causes the `TypeError` as the method signature does not match the way it is being invoked.

To fix the bug, the signature of the `get_indexer` method needs to be changed to match the way it is being called. The corrected code for the problematic function `get_indexer` is as follows:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str]=None, limit: Optional[int]=None, tolerance: Optional[Any]=None) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")

        # different closed or incompatible subtype -> no matches
        common_subtype = find_common_type(
            [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
        )
        if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

        # non-overlapping -> at most one match per interval in target_as_index
        # want exact matches -> need both left/right to match, so defer to
        # left/right get_indexer, compare elementwise, equality -> match
        left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
        right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
        indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        # heterogeneous scalar index: defer elementwise to get_loc
        # (non-overlapping so get_loc guarantees scalar of KeyError)
        indexer = []
        for key in target_as_index:
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError:
                loc = -1
            indexer.append(loc)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

With this corrected code, the `get_indexer` method now has a signature that matches the way it is being called when rounding the DataFrame columns, and it should pass the failing test.
