To fix the issue, it seems that the problem is occurring due to the `get_indexer` method. It's failing to find a matching signature, resulting in a TypeError. The issue is likely related to the mismatch between the expected input type and the actual input type for the `get_indexer` method call.

Here's the corrected version of the code for the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        ...

    return ensure_platform_int(np.array(indexer))
```

Changes made:
1. Added `()` at `self.is_overlapping` to call the function and get its return value.
2. Changed the return type to `np.ndarray`.
3. Returning `np.array(indexer)` after ensuring that it's a platform integer.

By making these changes, it should fix the TypeError issue and allow the `round` method to work properly when using a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.
