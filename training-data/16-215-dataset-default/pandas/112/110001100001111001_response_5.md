The potential error in the buggy function is likely in the block that checks for the overlapping indices and tries to find the indexer. The comparison logic for finding the indexer for non-overlapping indices seems to be incorrect.

The cause of the bug seems to be that the comparison logic for finding the indexer for non-overlapping indices is not correctly implemented.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic for finding the indexer for non-overlapping indices.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        # Handle overlapping indices
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    else:
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
        
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # Handle non-overlapping indices
            indexer = np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
            return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
        elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            # Handle homogeneous scalar index
            target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
            return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
        else:
            # Handle heterogeneous scalar index
            indexer = []
            for key in target_as_index:
                try:
                    loc = self.get_loc(key)
                except KeyError:
                    loc = -1
                indexer.append(loc)

            return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle overlapping and non-overlapping indices and return the expected output based on the given input.
