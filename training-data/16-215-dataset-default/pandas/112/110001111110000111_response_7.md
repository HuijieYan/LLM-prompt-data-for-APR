The buggy function is the `get_indexer` method in the `pandas/core/indexes/interval.py` file. The failing test `test_round_interval_category_columns` is trying to round a DataFrame `df` with columns created from a `CategoricalIndex` of `IntervalIndex`, and it is failing with a `TypeError: No matching signature found` error.

The error is occurring in the `get_indexer` method when it tries to call `self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)`. It seems that the issue is related to calling the `get_indexer` method on `self._engine`, which is likely not the correct approach when dealing with `IntervalIndex` and `CategoricalIndex`.

The failing test and the GitHub issue both provide examples and information about the problem. The failing test directly demonstrates the issue, and the GitHub issue details how the problem occurs and the expected behavior.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to review the logic of the `get_indexer` method and ensure that it handles the case of `CategoricalIndex` of `IntervalIndex` correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = "cannot handle overlapping indices; use IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)
    else:
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)
```

In the corrected code, the `get_indexer` method first checks if the `target` is an `IntervalIndex`, and if so, it calls the `get_indexer` method from the superclass. If not, it also calls the `get_indexer` method from the superclass. This ensures that the appropriate method is called based on the type of `target`, and it should resolve the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
