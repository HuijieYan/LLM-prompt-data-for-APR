The bug in the function is likely caused by the `get_indexer` method not handling the scalar interval target correctly, resulting in a TypeError being raised. This is evident from the failing test `test_round_interval_category_columns` that calls the `round` method on a DataFrame with interval category columns. The error message indicates a problem with `get_indexer` and `No matching signature found`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `get_indexer` method to handle the scalar interval target appropriately. We can achieve this by checking the type of the target, and if it's a scalar interval, we can directly use the `_engine` to get the indexer, similar to how it is handled for non-object dtype targets.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, (Interval, pd.Interval)):
        # handle scalar interval target by directly using _engine
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer([target_as_index])
    elif isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # rest of the code remains unchanged
        # ...
        pass
    else:
        # rest of the code remains unchanged
        # ...
        pass

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

With this correction, the `get_indexer` function should now handle the scalar interval target correctly and pass the failing test. The modification ensures that the `_engine` is used to get the indexer for scalar interval targets.
