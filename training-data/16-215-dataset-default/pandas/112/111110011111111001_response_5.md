The bug is likely caused by the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class, as indicated by the error message "No matching signature found". This suggests that there is an issue with the signature of the `get_indexer` method.

The failing test is attempting to round the values in a DataFrame with a CategoricalIndex of intervals. This involves calling the `round` method on the DataFrame, which in turn calls the `get_indexer` method of the index. The error is occurring within the `get_indexer` method, indicating that there is a problem with the way `target_as_index.values` is being processed.

To fix the bug, the `get_indexer` method needs to be modified to handle the input target as a scalar. This can be achieved by making sure that the `get_indexer` method only accepts a scalar value for the target.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target: scalar_t) -> np.intp:
    self._check_method(None)

    if not isinstance(target, (tuple, list, np.ndarray, pd.Index, pd.Series)):
        target = [target]

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    # Rest of the method implementation...
```

This modification ensures that `target` is converted to a list if it is not already an iterable type, and then passed to the `ensure_index` function to handle scalar inputs. This should resolve the issue and allow the failing test to pass.
