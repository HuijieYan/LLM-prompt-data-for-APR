The potential error in the buggy function is occurring in the `get_indexer` method when trying to call `self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)`. The error message indicates that there is no matching signature found for this method call, leading to a TypeError.

This bug is causing the failing test, as indicated by the error message stating that the `round` method fails when columns are a CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex. The failing test is trying to round a DataFrame with columns that are a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, resulting in the TypeError.

The GitHub issue further confirms that the `round` method fails when the columns are a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex and provides an expected output where it should round as normal.

To fix this bug, the `get_indexer` method needs to be modified to handle the case when the columns are a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # Handle the case when the columns are a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex
        if isinstance(target, CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target.categories, IntervalIndex):
            target_as_index = target.categories

        # rest of the code remains unchanged
        # ...
```

By handling the case when the columns are a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, the `get_indexer` method should now be able to handle the failing test case and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.
