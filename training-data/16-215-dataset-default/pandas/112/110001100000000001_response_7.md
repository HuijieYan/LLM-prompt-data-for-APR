1. The buggy function is a `get_indexer` function that is supposed to return an indexer array. It calls several related functions within the same file, such as `_check_method`, `is_overlapping`, `left`, and `right`. The function also calls other functions, such as `get_loc`, `equals`, and `ensure_index` from different classes.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the conditional statements that handle different types of indexes, especially within the `if(isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex))` block.

3. The potential bug's cause could be related to the logic within the conditional statements that handle the different types of indexes. The function is likely not returning the correct indexer array based on the different types of indexes and their characteristics.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Verifying the logic within the conditional statements to ensure that the correct checks and comparisons are being made for different index types.
   - Identifying any incorrect assumptions or comparisons being made within the conditional statements.
   - Ensuring that the correct functions are being called and that the returned values are being handled appropriately.

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        else:
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        # heterogeneous scalar index: defer elementwise to get_loc
        # (non-overlapping so get_loc guarantees scalar of KeyError)
        indexer = []
        for key in target_as_index:
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError:
                loc = -1
            indexer.append(loc)

    return ensure_platform_int(np.asarray(indexer))
```

In the corrected code, I have made the following changes:
- Fixed the `is_overlapping` method call to `self.is_overlapping()`.
- Removed the unnecessary comparison in the first conditional statement within the `if(isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex))` block.
- Ensured that the correct type conversion is being applied to the indexer array in the `else` block.
- Converted the `indexer` list to numpy array using `np.asarray()` before returning it.
