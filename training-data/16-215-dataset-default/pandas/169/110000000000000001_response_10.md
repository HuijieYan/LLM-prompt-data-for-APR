1. The buggy function is supposed to return values at the given quantile over the requested axis. However, there are some potential errors that need to be addressed.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `quantile` method where `data._data.quantile` is being called.

3. The bug's cause is that the `quantile` method is not functioning as expected and is potentially returning incorrect results due to the incorrect implementation of the `data._data.quantile` function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug would be to review and correct the implementation of the `data._data.quantile` function, ensure that the input parameters are being handled correctly, and verify the data transposition logic within the function.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    q : float or array-like, default 0.5 (50% quantile)
        Value between 0 <= q <= 1, the quantile(s) to compute.
    axis : {0, 1, 'index', 'columns'} (default 0)
        Equals 0 or 'index' for row-wise, 1 or 'columns' for column-wise.
    numeric_only : bool, default True
        If False, the quantile of datetime and timedelta data will be
        computed as well.
    interpolation : {'linear', 'lower', 'higher', 'midpoint', 'nearest'}
        This optional parameter specifies the interpolation method to use,
        when the desired quantile lies between two data points `i` and `j`.

        * linear: `i + (j - i) * fraction`, where `fraction` is the
          fractional part of the index surrounded by `i` and `j`.
        * lower: `i`.
        * higher: `j`.
        * nearest: `i` or `j` whichever is nearest.
        * midpoint: (`i` + `j`) / 2.

    Returns
    -------
    Series or DataFrame
        If ``q`` is an array, a DataFrame will be returned where the
          index is ``q``, the columns are the columns of self, and the
          values are the quantiles.
        If ``q`` is a float, a Series will be returned where the
          index is the columns of self and the values are the quantiles.
    """

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```
In the corrected code, we are directly calling the `quantile` method on the `data` object to compute the quantile, and the unnecessary logic related to `data._data.quantile` has been removed.
