The bug is likely located in the quantile function in the DataFrame class, specifically in the concatenation step when trying to compute the quantile on datetime data.

The failing test `test_quantile_empty_no_columns` in the `test_quantile.py` file is trying to validate the behavior when the DataFrame has datetime data and no columns. The error message indicates that there is a ValueError due to needing at least one array to concatenate.

The cause of the bug is related to the DataFrame quantile function's inability to handle datetime data properly, which leads to an error during the concatenation process.

To fix the bug, the quantile function in the DataFrame class needs to be updated to handle datetime data correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T
    
    result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation)

    return result
```

With this correction, the quantile function should be able to handle datetime data properly and pass the failing test. Additionally, it should satisfy the expected input/output variable information and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
