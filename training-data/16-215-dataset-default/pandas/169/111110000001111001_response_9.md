The issue with the buggy function is that it is not handling the input parameters correctly, resulting in incorrect output. The function is trying to create a new DataFrame from the input DataFrame, but it's not handling the case where the input DataFrame is empty.

The potential error location is in the section where the function is trying to create a new DataFrame from the input data and in the subsequent conditional checks.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the case where the input DataFrame is empty, leading to unexpected behavior when trying to perform operations on the empty DataFrame.

To fix the bug, we can add a conditional check to handle the case where the input DataFrame is empty, and return an empty DataFrame in that case. Additionally, we need to correct the logic for transposing the DataFrame and constructing the result.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    ... (rest of the docstring remains unchanged)

    """
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if len(data) == 0:
        return self._constructor()

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data.quantile(q, interpolation=interpolation)

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

This corrected code includes a conditional check to handle the case where the input DataFrame is empty, as well as correcting the logic for transposing the DataFrame and constructing the result. It should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
