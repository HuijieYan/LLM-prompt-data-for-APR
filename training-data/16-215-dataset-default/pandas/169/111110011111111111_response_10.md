The issue is occurring in the quantile function of the DataFrame class, specifically when dealing with datetime data. The failing test is trying to obtain the quantile of a DataFrame with datetime values, which causes an error when concatenating the arrays.

Looking at the _get_numeric_data method that is being used inside the quantile function, it seems that it may be dropping all columns when the data contains datetime values, resulting in an empty DataFrame. This in turn causes issues when trying to perform operations such as concatenation.

The GitHub issue highlights that the DataFrame should return results similar to Series when dealing with datetime data, which suggests that the quantile function should handle datetime data more effectively.

To fix the bug, we can modify the quantile function to properly handle datetime data. We can adjust the logic to ensure that the DataFrame retains the necessary information for computing the quantile, even when dealing with datetime values.

Here's the corrected code for the quantile function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if numeric_only:
        data = self.select_dtypes(include=['number'])
    else:
        data = self

    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

This corrected code modifies the data selection process to handle numeric and non-numeric columns appropriately, ensuring that the necessary information for computing the quantile is retained. The adjusted logic should resolve the issue and allow the quantile function to handle datetime data effectively.

With this correction, the quantile function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. It should also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.
