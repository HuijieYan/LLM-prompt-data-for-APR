1. The buggy function is within the DataFrame class, and it is responsible for calculating the quantile over a given axis. The function calls the `_check_percentile` method from the same class and relies on the `_get_numeric_data` method to determine the data for calculation. It also uses the `_get_axis_number` method to determine the axis for calculation.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the method `_get_numeric_data`. This method is responsible for retrieving the numeric data from the DataFrame. If this method is not implemented correctly, it may not retrieve the appropriate data for quantile calculation.

3. The potential cause of the bug is because the method `_get_numeric_data` may not be retrieving the correct data for quantile calculation, leading to incorrect results.

4. To fix the bug, one approach is to ensure that the `_get_numeric_data` method retrieves the correct data. Another approach is to review the calculations within the `quantile` method to ensure they are accurate and return the expected results.

5. Below is the corrected code:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    q : float or array-like, default 0.5 (50% quantile)
        Value between 0 <= q <= 1, the quantile(s) to compute.
    axis : {0, 1, 'index', 'columns'} (default 0)
        Equals 0 or 'index' for row-wise, 1 or 'columns' for column-wise.
    numeric_only : bool, default True
        If False, the quantile of datetime and timedelta data will be
        computed as well.
    interpolation : {'linear', 'lower', 'higher', 'midpoint', 'nearest'}
        This optional parameter specifies the interpolation method to use,
        when the desired quantile lies between two data points `i` and `j`:

        * linear: `i + (j - i) * fraction`, where `fraction` is the
          fractional part of the index surrounded by `i` and `j`.
        * lower: `i`.
        * higher: `j`.
        * nearest: `i` or `j` whichever is nearest.
        * midpoint: (`i` + `j`) / 2.

    Returns
    -------
    Series or DataFrame

        If ``q`` is an array, a DataFrame will be returned where the
          index is ``q``, the columns are the columns of self, and the
          values are the quantiles.
        If ``q`` is a float, a Series will be returned where the
          index is the columns of self and the values are the quantiles.

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)

    # Using the apply method to calculate quantiles
    result = data.apply(lambda x: x.quantile(q, interpolation=interpolation))

    return result
```
This corrected code simplifies the calculation of quantiles by using the apply method to directly calculate the quantiles for each column or row in the DataFrame. This approach eliminates the need to manually transpose and calculate quantiles, potentially avoiding the previous bug.
