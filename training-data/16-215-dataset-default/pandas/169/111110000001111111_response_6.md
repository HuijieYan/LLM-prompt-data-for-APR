The issue with the `quantile` method in the `DataFrame` class is that it is not handling datetime data properly. When attempting to calculate the quantiles of a DataFrame containing datetime data, it raises a `ValueError` due to a concatenation problem.

The root cause of the issue lies in the `_get_numeric_data()` method that is called within the `quantile` function. This method returns an empty DataFrame when called on datetime data, which leads to the subsequent error.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `quantile` method to handle datetime data appropriately. We should check the data type of the columns and only apply quantile calculation to numeric data. This modification will prevent the concatenation error that occurs.

Additionally, we should consider handling the case when `q` is a float to return a Series instead of a DataFrame, as that aligns with the behavior of the `quantile` method for a Series.

Here's the corrected code for the `quantile` method:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)
    
    if numeric_only:
        data = self._get_numeric_data()
    else:
        data = self
    
    if isinstance(q, list):
        result = {}
        for col in data.columns:
            result[col] = data[col].quantile(q=q, interpolation=interpolation)
        result = pd.DataFrame([result])
    else:
        result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation)

    return result
```

This modified method ensures that when `numeric_only` is True, only numeric columns are used for quantile calculation. It also handles the case when `q` is a list to return a DataFrame with the calculated quantiles for each column.

This corrected method should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and handle datetime data appropriately as well.
