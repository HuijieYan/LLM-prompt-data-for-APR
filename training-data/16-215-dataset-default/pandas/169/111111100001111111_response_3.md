The issue is with the `_check_percentile` method and the data manipulation in the `quantile` method. When a DataFrame with datetime data is passed to the `quantile` method, the code tries to transpose the data and then calculate the quantile for date and time values. This leads to incorrect and empty data, resulting in the error.

To fix this issue, we need to remove the unnecessary transposition of data and modify the way quantiles are calculated for datetime data within the `quantile` method.

Another issue is with the `_check_percentile` method, which is being called but causes an error due to incorrect handling of datetime objects.

A possible approach to fixing the bug could be to modify the `quantile` method to perform correct calculations for datetime data and to remove the unnecessary transposition of data. Additionally, the `_check_percentile` method needs to be updated to handle datetime objects correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `quantile` method:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    ... (existing docstring)

    """
    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self

    if not data.empty:
        result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation)
        return result
    else:
        return self._constructor()
```

This corrected code should effectively handle datetime data and avoid the unnecessary transposition of the data.

This fix should resolve the GitHub issue by ensuring that the DataFrame returns the correct quantile, just as the Series does.
