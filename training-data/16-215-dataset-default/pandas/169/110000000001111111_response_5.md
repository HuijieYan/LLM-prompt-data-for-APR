The issue lies in the `quantile` function, which is not handling datetime data correctly when called on a DataFrame. The function is attempting to transpose the data and perform quantile calculations, but it's running into issues because it is not adequately handling datetime data.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not designed to handle datetime data when calculating quantiles. This is evident from the GitHub issue, which demonstrates that the DataFrame does not return the expected result for datetime data.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_numeric_data` method to handle datetime data properly and perform quantile calculations on the numeric columns only.

We also need to adjust the code to handle the case when `q` is a list, as it will return a DataFrame with quantiles for each column when `q` is an array.

Here is the corrected code for the `quantile` function:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    q : float or array-like, default 0.5 (50% quantile)
        Value between 0 <= q <= 1, the quantile(s) to compute.
    axis : {0, 1, 'index', 'columns'} (default 0)
        Equals 0 or 'index' for row-wise, 1 or 'columns' for column-wise.
    numeric_only : bool, default True
        If False, the quantile of datetime and timedelta data will be
        computed as well.
    interpolation : {'linear', 'lower', 'higher', 'midpoint', 'nearest'}
        This optional parameter specifies the interpolation method to use,
        when the desired quantile lies between two data points `i` and `j`.

        * linear: `i + (j - i) * fraction`, where `fraction` is the
          fractional part of the index surrounded by `i` and `j`.
        * lower: `i`.
        * higher: `j`.
        * nearest: `i` or `j` whichever is nearest.
        * midpoint: (`i` + `j`) / 2.

    Returns
    -------
    Series or DataFrame

        If ``q`` is an array, a DataFrame will be returned where the
          index is ``q``, the columns are the columns of self, and the
          values are the quantiles.
        If ``q`` is a float, a Series will be returned where the
          index is the columns of self and the values are the quantiles.
    """

    # Check if q is a list and convert it to a Series if necessary
    if not isinstance(q, (list, np.ndarray)):
        q = pd.Series([q])
    else:
        q = pd.Series(q)

    # Check if numeric_only is False and handle datetime and timedelta data
    if not numeric_only:
        data = self._get_numeric_data()
    else:
        data = self.select_dtypes(include=[np.number])

    # Calculate the quantiles
    result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation)

    # Return the result as a DataFrame if q is a list, otherwise return a Series
    if len(q) > 1:
        return result
    else:
        return result.T.squeeze()

# Add the corrected method to the DataFrame class
pd.DataFrame.quantile = quantile
```

With these changes, the `quantile` function should now handle datetime data properly and return the expected results for both Series and DataFrame inputs. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub case.
