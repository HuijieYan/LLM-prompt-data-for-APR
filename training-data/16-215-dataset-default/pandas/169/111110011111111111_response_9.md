The issue is likely in the `_constructor` and `_get_numeric_data` methods in the DataFrame class. It seems that these methods are not handling datetime data correctly, resulting in an error when trying to concatenate them.

The failing tests involve creating a DataFrame from a date range and then calling the `quantile` method on it. The expected behavior is to return a Series or DataFrame with the quantiles of the data, which is not happening due to the error.

To fix the bug, the `_get_numeric_data` method needs to be modified to handle datetime data properly. Additionally, the logic in the `quantile` method should also be adjusted to correctly handle datetime data.

Here's the corrected code for the `quantile` method:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)

    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    if isinstance(data, DataFrame):
        result = data._data.quantile(q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed)
    else:
        result = data.quantile(q, interpolation=interpolation)

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

This corrected code should handle the datetime data properly without causing the concatenation error. It should also return the expected output for the failing tests.
