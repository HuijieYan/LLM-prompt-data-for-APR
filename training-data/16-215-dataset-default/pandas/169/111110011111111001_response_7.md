##  Analysis
The issue seems to be related to how the `DataFrame` is initialized and processed within the `quantile` method. The error message indicates that there is an attempt to concatenate empty arrays, which suggests that the data is not being handled correctly.

The `_get_numeric_data` method is called within the `quantile` method, and it seems to be dropping all columns when the DataFrame has only non-numeric data. This leads to errors when trying to calculate quantiles.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by `_get_numeric_data()` method dropping all columns when the DataFrame has only non-numeric data. This behavior wasn't handled properly within the `quantile` method, leading to errors when trying to calculate quantiles.

## Possible approaches for fixing the bug
1. Check if the DataFrame is empty after calling `_get_numeric_data` and handle this case appropriately.
2. Ensure that when calculating quantiles, the necessary data is available, and if not, handle this error condition gracefully.

## The corrected code
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if len(self.columns) == 0:  # Check if the DataFrame is empty
        if isinstance(q, list):
            return self._constructor(data=[], columns=[], index=q)
        else:
            return self._constructor_sliced(data=[], name=q)
        
    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In the corrected code, we explicitly check if the DataFrame is empty and handle this case by returning appropriate empty Series or DataFrame based on the type of `q`. This should resolve the issue and make the function pass the failing tests.
