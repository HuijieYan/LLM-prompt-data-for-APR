The issue in the buggy function is that, for datetime data, the _get_numeric_data() method may drop all columns, causing the subsequent quantile calculation to fail.

To fix this issue, modify the quantile() function to handle datetime data appropriately. You can do this by explicitly checking the data type of the DataFrame columns and then selecting numeric columns for quantile calculation, if available. If no numeric columns are available, raise an error or return an empty result dataframe/Series. 

Here's an example of how the function can be modified:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    # Rest of the function stays the same

    # New code to handle numeric_only for datetime data
    if numeric_only:
        data = self._get_numeric_data()
        if len(data.columns) == 0:
            raise ValueError("No numeric data available for quantile calculation.")
    else:
        data = self
    # Rest of the function as is
```

With this update, the quantile function will handle the case where all columns are dropped due to non-numeric data more gracefully and won't trigger the need for concatenation of empty arrays, as seen in the failing test. After making this change, the issue should be resolved, and the DataFrame quantile function should work correctly with datetime data.
