1. The buggy function is `quantile` which is a method of the `DataFrame` class. The failing test `test_quantile_empty_no_columns` is trying to use the `quantile` method with an empty DataFrame, resulting in a `ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate`.

2. The potential error location within the `quantile` function is the line `result = df.quantile(0.5)` in the failing test. This line is causing the `ValueError`.

3. Cause of the bug:
   (a). The `quantile` method is supposed to return values at the given quantile over the requested axis.
   (b). The failing test is trying to calculate the quantile of an empty DataFrame, which is causing the `ValueError`.
   (c). The error message indicates that there is an attempt to concatenate empty arrays, leading to the `ValueError`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Add a condition in the `quantile` method to check for the case when the DataFrame is empty, and return an appropriate result instead of trying to calculate the quantile.
   (b). Modify the failing test to not rely on calculating the quantile of an empty DataFrame, or handle the empty DataFrame case in the test.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    if self.empty:
        raise ValueError("DataFrame is empty")
    # ... rest of the code remains the same
```
With this modification, the `quantile` method will raise a `ValueError` if the DataFrame is empty, preventing the attempt to calculate the quantile. This change will ensure that the failing test doesn't run into the `ValueError` caused by an attempt to calculate the quantile of an empty DataFrame.
