The buggy function is the 'quantile' function in the 'pandas/core/frame.py' file. The error message from the failing test indicates a ValueError: "need at least one array to concatenate".

From the error message, it seems that the value error is being raised during the concatenation of arrays. This suggests that the 'data._data.quantile' method is not returning the expected array or arrays.

The failing test 'test_quantile_empty_no_columns' tests when a DataFrame with no columns is used with the 'quantile' method, and it expects an empty result. However, the current implementation seems to raise an error due to incorrect concatenation of arrays.

The GitHub issue describes the problem as the 'DataFrame Quantile Broken with Datetime Data', specifically mentioning that the DataFrame should return the result just as the Series does.

To fix this issue, we need to address the concatenation of arrays that is causing the ValueError. One possible approach is to debug the 'data._data.quantile' method to ensure it returns the expected array or arrays to avoid the concatenation issue.

Here's the corrected code for the 'quantile' function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    [Previous function comments remain unchanged]

    """
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, numeric_only=numeric_only)

    return result
```

In this corrected code, we remove the direct usage of 'data._data.quantile' and instead call 'data.quantile' with the required parameters. This should ensure that the correct array or arrays are returned without causing the ValueError. This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue described in the GitHub post.
