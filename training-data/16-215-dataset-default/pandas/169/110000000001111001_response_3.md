The cause of the bug is that the `quantile` method is not working correctly due to issues with the `data` and `is_transposed` variables. The `data` variable is not being correctly assigned, and the `is_transposed` variable is not being used effectively to transpose the data when necessary.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `data` variable is correctly assigned based on the `numeric_only` parameter, and then modify the `is_transposed` variable to transpose the data if the `axis` is set to 1.

Here's the corrected code for the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    q : float or array-like, default 0.5 (50% quantile)
        Value between 0 <= q <= 1, the quantile(s) to compute.
    axis : {0, 1, 'index', 'columns'} (default 0)
        Equals 0 or 'index' for row-wise, 1 or 'columns' for column-wise.
    numeric_only : bool, default True
        If False, the quantile of datetime and timedelta data will be
        computed as well.
    interpolation : {'linear', 'lower', 'higher', 'midpoint', 'nearest'}
        This optional parameter specifies the interpolation method to use,
        when the desired quantile lies between two data points `i` and `j`.

        * linear: `i + (j - i) * fraction`, where `fraction` is the
          fractional part of the index surrounded by `i` and `j`.
        * lower: `i`.
        * higher: `j`.
        * nearest: `i` or `j` whichever is nearest.
        * midpoint: (`i` + `j`) / 2.

    Returns
    -------
    Series or DataFrame

        If ``q`` is an array, a DataFrame will be returned where the
          index is ``q``, the columns are the columns of self, and the
          values are the quantiles.
        If ``q`` is a float, a Series will be returned where the
          index is the columns of self and the values are the quantiles.
    """

    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)

    if axis == 1:
        data = data.T

    result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation)

    return result
```

This corrected code ensures that the `data` variable is correctly assigned based on the value of `numeric_only`, and that the data is transposed when the `axis` is set to 1. It also uses the `quantile` method directly on the `data` variable to calculate the quantile.
