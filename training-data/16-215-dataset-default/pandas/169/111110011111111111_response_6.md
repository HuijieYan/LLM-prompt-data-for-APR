The problem lies in the `_constructor(result)` and `_constructor_sliced(result, name=q)` calls in the buggy `quantile` function. These calls are used to create a new DataFrame or Series from the result of the `quantile` calculation, but are causing the concatenation error due to `result` not containing any value.

The cause of the bug is that in the case of no numeric data (e.g., when handling datetime data), `data._data.quantile` returns an empty DataFrame, leading to the concatenation error when attempting to create a new Series or DataFrame from this empty result.

To fix the bug, we need to check for empty `result` and handle it appropriately. We should return an empty Series or DataFrame when the result is empty, matching the behavior of `quantile` on a Series.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if `result` is empty before attempting to create a new Series or DataFrame from it.
2. If `result` is empty, return an empty Series or DataFrame directly.
3. Update the `quantile` function to always return a Series, even when `q` is a single value, to match the behavior of `quantile` on a Series.

Here's the corrected code for the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=False
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = result.T
    else:
        result = result.squeeze(axis=0)

    return result
```

This corrected code checks the dimension of the result and squeezes it to ensure that `quantile` always returns a Series, matching the behavior of `quantile` on a Series. This should resolve the issue and pass the failing test, as well as satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
