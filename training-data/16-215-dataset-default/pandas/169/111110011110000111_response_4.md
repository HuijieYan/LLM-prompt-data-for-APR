## Analysis
The problematic function is the `quantile` method within the `DataFrame` class. The method is responsible for returning values at the given quantile over the requested axis. The corresponding failing test `test_quantile_empty_no_columns` tries to test the behavior of the `quantile` method for an empty DataFrame with no columns, and it is failing with a `ValueError` during the concatenation step when the method tries to compute the quantile.

Looking at the failing test, it seems that the method is not handling empty DataFrames with no columns correctly, which is leading to the `ValueError` during concatenation. The GitHub issue title and detailed description also confirm the problem, where the DataFrame is not returning the expected output for datetime data, as compared to Series.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the `quantile` method not handling empty DataFrames with no columns correctly, leading to a `ValueError` during concatenation. The method is not behaving as expected for datetime data, and it is not returning the expected output.

## Possible Approaches
1. Modify the code within the `quantile` method to handle the case of an empty DataFrame with no columns correctly.
2. Ensure that the method behaves consistently for datetime data, similar to how the `quantile` method for Series behaves.

## Corrected Code
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    # check for the special case of an empty DataFrame with no columns
    if self.empty or len(self.columns) == 0:
        if isinstance(q, (list, np.ndarray)):
            return pd.DataFrame(index=q, columns=self.columns)
        else:
            return pd.Series(index=self.columns)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    # passing the correct arguments to the quantile method to compute the quantiles
    result = data._data.quantile(q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed)

    # handling the case where the result is a DataFrame or a Series
    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

With these changes, the `quantile` method will now handle the case of an empty DataFrame with no columns correctly and should behave consistently for datetime data. It should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub related to the behavior of the `quantile` method for empty DataFrames and datetime data.
