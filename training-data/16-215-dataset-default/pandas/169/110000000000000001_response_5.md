1. The buggy function is a method for calculating the quantile of a dataset. It takes in parameters such as the quantile value, axis, numeric_only, and interpolation method. The function then checks the percentiles and calculates the quantiles using the numpy percentile function.

2. The potential error in the function could be in the calculation of the quantile using the numpy percentile function, or in the handling of the transposed data.

3. The bug in the function is that the calculation of the quantile is not taking into account the provided axis and transposed data, which can lead to incorrect quantile values being returned.

4. To fix the bug, we can modify the function to correctly apply the axis and handle the transpose when calculating the quantile. This can be done by taking the axis and transpose into account while calling the numpy percentile function.

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    if is_transposed:
        result = data._data.quantile(q, axis=0, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=False)
    else:
        result = data._data.quantile(q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=True)

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result, index=data.index, columns=data.columns)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, index = data.columns, name = q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```
In the corrected code, we have modified the calculation of the quantile value by taking the axis and transpose into account when calling the numpy percentile function. We also handle the creation of the result based on the axis and transpose.
