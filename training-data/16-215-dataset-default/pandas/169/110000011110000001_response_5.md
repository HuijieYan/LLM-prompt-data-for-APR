1. The buggy function is the 'quantile' function which is used to return values at the given quantile over the requested axis. The failing test is testing the handling of an empty DataFrame when the 'quantile' function is called with a specific quantile value of 0.5. The error message indicates that there is an issue with concatenation due to needing at least one array to concatenate.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the concatenation process, which is being used to concatenate the values for quantile calculation.

3. The bug's cause is likely due to a specific edge case where an empty DataFrame is being used and the function does not handle this scenario properly. The error message indicates a ValueError due to needing at least one array to concatenate when an empty DataFrame is encountered.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Add a check in the 'quantile' function to handle the scenario of an empty DataFrame and return an empty Series or DataFrame accordingly.
   - Modify the concatenation process to handle the case of an empty DataFrame without causing a ValueError.

5. Corrected code for the 'quantile' function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged

    if self.empty:  # Check if DataFrame is empty
        if np.isscalar(q):  # For a single quantile value
            return pd.Series([], name=q)
        else:  # For an array of quantile values
            return pd.DataFrame([], index=q)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

By adding a check for an empty DataFrame at the beginning of the 'quantile' function, we can handle the edge case where an empty DataFrame is encountered and return an empty Series or DataFrame accordingly. This correction should resolve the ValueError encountered in the failing test.
