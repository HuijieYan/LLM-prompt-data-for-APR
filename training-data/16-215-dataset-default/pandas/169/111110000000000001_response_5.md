1. The buggy function is the `quantile` function within the `DataFrame` class of the pandas library in Python. This function is used to return values at the given quantile over the requested axis.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be in the line `data._data.quantile(qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed)`, where the issue might be occurring during the computation of the quantile. 

3. (a) In the `quantile` function, the error might be caused by incorrect computation of the quantile, leading to incorrect output.
   (b) The DataFrame class in pandas has a function `_constructor` that might be getting called within the `quantile` function, which could potentially affect the behavior of the function.
   
4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check the computation of the quantile to ensure it is done correctly.
   - Verify the input parameters and ensure they are being used as intended.
   - Look into the behavior of the `_constructor` function and its potential impact on the `quantile` function.

5. Corrected code:
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=axis, numeric_only=numeric_only, interpolation=interpolation)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```
In the corrected code, the `quantile` function is modified to use the `quantile` method of the `data` object instead of directly calling `_data.quantile`. This change ensures that the computation of the quantile is handled correctly based on the input parameters and the data.
