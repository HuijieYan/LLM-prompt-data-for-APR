1. Analyzing the buggy function and the related issue, it appears that the problem occurs when trying to call the `quantile` function on a DataFrame with datetime data, as it raises a ValueError.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the `result = data._data.quantile()` line, where the issue with concatenating arrays arises.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function `quantile` is part of the `DataFrame` class and is used to calculate quantiles on the DataFrame.
   (b). The related issue on GitHub highlights that calling `quantile` on a DataFrame with datetime data raises a ValueError due to problems with concatenating arrays.
   (c). The related functions, such as `_get_numeric_data()` and other internal manipulations, may also contribute to the problematic behavior.
   (d). The GitHub issue information provides an example where calling `pd.DataFrame(pd.date_range('1/1/18', periods=5)).quantile()` raises a ValueError, indicating that the issue is related to datetime data.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Check if there is a specific condition for handling datetime data within the `quantile` function and modify the logic accordingly.
   b. Ensure that datetime data is appropriately handled during the calculation of quantiles.
   c. Review the underlying data manipulation steps and ensure they are compatible with datetime data.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    if isinstance(data, pd.DataFrame) and data.select_dtypes(include=[np.datetime64]).shape[1] > 0:
        result = data.quantile(q, axis=axis, numeric_only=numeric_only, interpolation=interpolation)
    else:
        result = data._data.quantile(
            qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
        )
    
    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)
    
    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T
    
    return result
```
In the corrected code, an additional condition is added to check if the data contains datetime values. If it does, the `quantile` function is called directly on the DataFrame, bypassing the internal data manipulation that caused the issue with concatenating arrays. This should resolve the problem with calculating quantiles on DataFrames with datetime data.
