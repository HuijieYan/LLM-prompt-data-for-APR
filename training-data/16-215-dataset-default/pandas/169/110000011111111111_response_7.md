The issue with the buggy function seems to be that it is not handling datetime data properly, resulting in the error when trying to calculate the quantile of datetime values. This is also consistent with the failing test, which specifically mentions issues with datetime data.

The specific issue within the function appears to be the handling of the `data` variable, which is being set incorrectly and results in an empty DataFrame or BlockManager. This causes the concatenation error when trying to calculate the quantile.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle datetime data and perform the quantile calculation accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if numeric_only:
        data = self._get_numeric_data()
    else:
        data = self._get_numeric_data()._copy()

    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result).T
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    return result
```

With this corrected code, the function should now properly handle datetime data and perform the quantile calculation, allowing it to pass the failing test and resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
