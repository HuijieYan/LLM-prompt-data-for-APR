The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `_concat_compat` function, as indicated by the error message `ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate` and the analysis of the failing test cases.

The cause of the bug is that when the DataFrame contains datetime data, the `_constructor` method is not being used to create the result, resulting in incorrect concatenation of arrays in the internal implementation.

To fix the bug, the `_constructor` method should be used to create the result when `numeric_only` is True. This ensures that when the result is a Series, it uses the appropriate constructor, and when the result is a DataFrame, it uses the `_constructor_sliced` method.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    ... (rest of the docstring remains unchanged) ...

    """
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if numeric_only:
        data = self._get_numeric_data()

        result = data._data.quantile(q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation)
        if result.ndim == 2:
            result = self._constructor(result)
        else:
            result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)
    else:
        # This block is added to handle non-numeric data
        result = self._data.quantile(q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation)

    return result
```

With this corrected code, the function should now correctly handle both numeric and non-numeric data in the DataFrame, and pass the failing test case.

This fixed version of the function will resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub report, and the DataFrame will return the expected output similar to a Series.
