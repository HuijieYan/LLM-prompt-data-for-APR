The issue with the buggy function is that in the cases provided, the function returns an empty DataFrame rather than the expected Series or DataFrame. This happens because the `data` variable is empty, which leads to the result being empty as well.

The cause of this issue is that the `_get_numeric_data` method called inside the function returns an empty DataFrame in the cases provided. This results in `data` being empty, leading to an incorrect output.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the function to handle the case when there is no numeric data present in the input DataFrame. We can modify the function to leverage an alternative method for computing the quantile when there is no numeric data available.

The corrected version of the `quantile` function is as follows:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if numeric_only:
        data = self._get_numeric_data()
        if data.empty:
            return pd.Series()
    else:
        data = self

    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

With this corrected version, when `numeric_only` is `True` and the `data` variable is empty, the function will return an empty Series instead of an empty DataFrame. This ensures that the function handles the case of no numeric data correctly, as evidenced by the failing test.

The corrected function satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided and should pass the failing test.
