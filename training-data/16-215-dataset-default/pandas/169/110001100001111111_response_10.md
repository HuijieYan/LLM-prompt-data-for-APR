The buggy function `quantile` is designed to return values at the given quantile over the requested axis. The bug causes the function to fail when dealing with datetime data in a DataFrame, producing an error that indicates the need for at least one array to be concatenated. This error prevents the function from returning the expected output and results in a ValueError.

The bug is likely caused by the function's inability to handle datetime data properly, leading to an error when attempting to concatenate arrays. The issue reported on GitHub supports this, as it shows that the `quantile` method works fine with a Series of datetime data but fails with a DataFrame.

To fix the bug, the `quantile` function needs to be modified to handle datetime data correctly and return the expected output. This may involve updating the logic for handling datetime and timedelta data within the function, as well as ensuring that the concatenation operation is performed properly.

Here is the corrected code for the `quantile` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over the requested axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    q : float or array-like, default 0.5 (50% quantile)
        Value between 0 <= q <= 1, the quantile(s) to compute.
    axis : {0, 1, 'index', 'columns'} (default 0)
        Equals 0 or 'index' for row-wise, 1 or 'columns' for column-wise.
    numeric_only : bool, default True
        If False, the quantile of datetime and timedelta data will be computed as well.
    interpolation : {'linear', 'lower', 'higher', 'midpoint', 'nearest'}
        This optional parameter specifies the interpolation method to use,
        when the desired quantile lies between two data points `i` and `j`:

        * linear: `i + (j - i) * fraction`, where `fraction` is the
          fractional part of the index surrounded by `i` and `j`.
        * lower: `i`.
        * higher: `j`.
        * nearest: `i` or `j` whichever is nearest.
        * midpoint: (`i` + `j`) / 2.

    Returns
    -------
    Series or DataFrame

        If ``q`` is an array, a DataFrame will be returned where the
          index is ``q``, the columns are the columns of self, and the
          values are the quantiles.
        If ``q`` is a float, a Series will be returned where the
          index is the columns of self and the values are the quantiles.

    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)

    # Check if data contains datetime or timedelta data
    if not data.select_dtypes(include='datetime64').empty:
        # Process datetime data
        result = data.select_dtypes(include='datetime64').quantile(q, interpolation=interpolation)
    elif not data.select_dtypes(include='timedelta64').empty:
        # Process timedelta data
        result = data.select_dtypes(include='timedelta64').quantile(q, interpolation=interpolation)
    else:
        # No datetime or timedelta data, proceed as usual
        result = data.quantile(q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation)

    return result
```

The corrected function handles datetime and timedelta data by checking for their presence in the input `DataFrame` and processing them accordingly. This ensures that the function can handle datetime data properly and should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
