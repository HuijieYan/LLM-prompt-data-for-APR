The issue with the buggy function is that it is not properly handling the input DataFrame `self`. The variable `data` is being set to an empty DataFrame, which is incorrect. Additionally, `data.columns` and `data._data` are also incorrect.

The potential error location within the problematic function is when trying to set the `data` variable based on `self._get_numeric_data()` if `numeric_only` is True, otherwise setting it to `self`. This logic is incorrect and resulted in an empty DataFrame being assigned to `data`.

The bug is caused by the improper handling of the input DataFrame `self`, which leads to incorrect values being assigned to the `data` variable and its related attributes.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the input DataFrame `self` and set the `data` variable based on whether `numeric_only` is True or False.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if numeric_only:
        data = self._get_numeric_data()
    else:
        data = self

    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

This corrected code ensures that the `data` variable is properly set based on the `numeric_only` parameter, and the other related attributes are derived from the correct `data` variable.
