1. The buggy function `quantile` is a method within the `DataFrame` class, which has a relationship with related functions such as `_check_percentile`, `_get_numeric_data`, and some functions from the same file but not the same class. The `quantile` function is responsible for returning values at the given quantile over the requested axis.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self`. This line is trying to check if `numeric_only` is `True` and then get the numeric data using `_get_numeric_data`. 

3. The bug's cause is primarily due to a potential inconsistency in the input data. The function is attempting to use `_get_numeric_data()` only when `numeric_only` is `True`. However, the `DataFrame` class does not have a method named `_get_numeric_data()`, which leads to this inconsistency and the bug.

4. To fix the bug, we can modify the code to handle the `numeric_only` parameter appropriately and ensure that the necessary data is retrieved based on its value.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.
    
    ... (rest of the documentation remains the same)
    """

    # Checking for numeric_only and obtaining the appropriate data
    if numeric_only:
        data = self._get_numeric_data()
    else:
        data = self

    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    # rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

In the corrected code, we have removed the inconsistency in data retrieval by checking the `numeric_only` parameter and obtaining the appropriate data based on its value. This ensures that the correct data is used, addressing the bug in the function.
