The issue is caused by the calculation inside the `quantile` function failing when working with datetime data in a DataFrame, which causes a `ValueError` related to concatenation. This problem occurs because the specific path for handling datetime and timedelta data is not being properly activated, resulting in incompatible data for concatenation. The actual behavior differs from the expected because the `quantile` function should handle datetime data as well as it does with Series data.

The `is_transposed` flag indicates whether the data needs to be transposed, and it appears to be set to `False` when it should be set to `True` for datetime data calculations. This causes the function to manipulate the DataFrame incorrectly, leading to the ValueError.

To fix this bug, the `is_transposed` flag needs to be set based on the data type being processed, along with proper handling for datetime and timedelta data in the quantile calculation. 

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    ... [rest of the docstring]

    """

    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)

    if any(data.dtypes.apply(lambda x: np.issubdtype(x, np.datetime64))):  # Check if there are datetime columns
        is_transposed = True  # Set is_transposed to True for datetime data
    else:
        is_transposed = False

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In this fix, we check if there are any columns with a datetime data type in the DataFrame `data`. If there are, `is_transposed` is set to `True` to enable proper handling of datetime data within the quantile calculation. This addresses the issue of improper concatenation and resolves the bug.
