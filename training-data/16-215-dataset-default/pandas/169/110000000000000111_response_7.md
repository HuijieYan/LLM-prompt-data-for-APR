1. The buggy function is a method named quantile() for a DataFrame object in the pandas library. The GitHub issue is related to the fact that when using the quantile() method with a DataFrame containing datetime data, it raises a ValueError, while the equivalent method with a Series works fine.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the section where the quantile is being computed and the result is being processed. Specifically, the error could be related to the handling of datetime data within the DataFrame.

3. (a) The buggy function attempts to check the percentile, get the numeric data, and compute the quantile based on the provided parameters. It then processes the result and constructs the output.
   (b) The GitHub issue information indicates that when using the quantile() method with a DataFrame containing datetime data, a ValueError is raised. This could mean that the error is related to how the function is handling datetime data within the DataFrame.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could involve improving the handling of datetime data within the quantile() method. This could include updating the method to recognize datetime data and process it appropriately during the quantile computation.

5. Below is the corrected code for the quantile() method in the DataFrame. It handles datetime data and should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    try:
        result = data._data.quantile(
            qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
        )
    except ValueError:
        if all(isinstance(x, (pd.Timestamp, pd.Timedelta)) for x in data.values.ravel()):
            result = data._data._data.quantile(q)
        else:
            raise

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

This corrected code includes a try-except block to handle the case where the ValueError is raised due to datetime data. Inside the try block, it checks if all the values in the DataFrame are either of type pd.Timestamp or pd.Timedelta, and if so, it computes the quantile accordingly. If the conditions are not met, the original ValueError is raised. This modification should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug, allowing the quantile() method to handle datetime data within DataFrames correctly.
