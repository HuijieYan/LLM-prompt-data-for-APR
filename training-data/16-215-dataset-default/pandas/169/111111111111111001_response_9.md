The bug in the `quantile` function is likely caused by an issue with the data manipulation and axis handling. The failing test indicates a ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate, which suggests an issue with empty data concatenation.

Upon analysis of the related variables, it seems that in both cases, the `data` variable is empty and does not contain any columns. This leads to the error when quantile function tries to consolidate the data.

To fix this bug, the `quantile` function should be updated to handle the case when the input DataFrame does not contain any columns and should return an empty DataFrame or Series accordingly. This can be achieved by adding a check to see if the DataFrame contains any data before performing operations.

Here's the corrected code for the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    if data.empty:
        if isinstance(q, (list, np.ndarray)):
            return pd.DataFrame([], index=q, columns=[])
        else:
            return pd.Series([], name=q, dtype='float64')

    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed)

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

By adding a check for an empty DataFrame and returning an empty DataFrame or Series based on the type of `q`, the function should now behave correctly for the failing test cases.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and handle the edge case of empty data appropriately.
