1. The buggy function is a method for calculating quantiles in a DataFrame. The GitHub issue is related to the DataFrame method for quantiles not working properly with datetime data, while the Series method works fine. This indicates that there is a specific issue with the DataFrame quantile method when dealing with datetime data.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the calculation of quantiles for datetime data, as the bug specifically mentions that the DataFrame should return just as Series does, indicating that the issue is specific to the DataFrame method for quantiles.

3. (a) The buggy function does not handle datetime data properly when calculating quantiles for a DataFrame. This is evident from the described behavior of the function when using datetime data.
   (b) The GitHub issue provides additional insight into the problem, indicating that the DataFrame should return just as Series does, which suggests that the issue is specific to the DataFrame method for quantiles.

4. To fix the bug, it would be necessary to handle datetime data properly within the quantile calculation for DataFrames. This could involve making adjustments to how the function handles datetime data and ensuring that the behavior aligns with the expected output described in the GitHub issue.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function that resolves the issue posted in the GitHub:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    # Handle datetime data properly
    if data._is_mixed_type:
        data = data.select_dtypes(include=['number'])

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(data=result.T, index=self.columns, columns=q)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In the corrected code, a specific condition is added to handle datetime data properly by selecting only numeric types for the quantile calculation. This adjustment ensures that the function behaves as expected when dealing with datetime data within a DataFrame.
