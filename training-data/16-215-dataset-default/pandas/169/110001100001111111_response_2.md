Potential Error Location:
The error is likely occurring in the calculation of the quantile for datetime data in the DataFrame. The _get_numeric_data() method is being called, but it is not correctly handling datetime data.

Bug's Cause Analysis:
The bug is caused by the DataFrame quantile method not behaving the same way as the Series quantile method when dealing with datetime data. The DataFrame quantile method is incorrectly trying to call _get_numeric_data() and manipulate the data as if it were numeric, leading to the ValueError at the np.concatenate step.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the DataFrame quantile method to handle datetime data similarly to how the Series quantile method handles it.
2. Check for the data type and treat datetime values differently than numeric values in the quantile calculation.

Corrected Code:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    Other parameters, examples, See Also, and description remain the same

    """
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self.select_dtypes(include=['number']) if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data.quantile(
        q=q, axis=1 if is_transposed else 0, interpolation=interpolation
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result, index=q, columns=data.columns)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q, index=data.columns)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

This corrected code modifies the quantile function to handle datetime data using the `select_dtypes` method to filter out numeric data and calculate the quantile accordingly. This ensures that the quantile function behaves consistently for both Series and DataFrame, and should resolve the issue raised in the GitHub thread.
