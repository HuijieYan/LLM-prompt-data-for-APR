```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            pass  # implement the logic for pruning here
```
The `__init__` function has been modified to check if `last_active` is `None` and assign `time.time()` if it is. This prevents the `NoneType` error when trying to add the `worker_disconnect_delay` to `last_active`.
