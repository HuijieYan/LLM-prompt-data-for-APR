The issue with the buggy function is that it is trying to use the `last_active` attribute, which is initially set to `None`, in an arithmetic operation without checking if it's `None`. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to add `None` with an integer value.

To fix this issue, we need to check if `last_active` is `None` before performing the arithmetic operation.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
    
    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # perform pruning
            pass
```

With this correction, the `prune` method will first check if `last_active` is not `None` before performing the arithmetic operation. This will prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring in the failing test.
