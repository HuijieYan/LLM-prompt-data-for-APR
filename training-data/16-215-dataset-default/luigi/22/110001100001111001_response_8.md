The bug in the code is due to the missing import statement for the time module. This is causing the code to fail when trying to call the time.time() function.

To fix the bug:
1. Import the time module at the beginning of the file, so that the time.time() function can be called.
2. Replace the buggy function with the corrected code.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py
import time  # import the time module

# the corrected function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly initialize the 'started' variable with the current time in seconds since the epoch, satisfying the expected input/output variable information provided in case 1.
