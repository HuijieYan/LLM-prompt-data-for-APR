The potential error in the buggy function is that the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class is initialized as `None`, and later in the `prune` method it is used in a comparison with an integer value. This leads to a `TypeError` because you cannot add an integer to `None`.

To fix this bug, the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method should be initialized as the current time if no value is provided.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method will default to the current time if no value is provided. This will prevent the `TypeError` when comparing `None` with an integer value in the `prune` method.

The corrected code should pass the failing test.
