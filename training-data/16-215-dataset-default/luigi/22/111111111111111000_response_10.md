To fix the buggy function, you need to modify the `__init__` method in the `Worker` class to initialize the `last_active` attribute with the provided value. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:  # Check if last_active is given
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch if last_active is not provided
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this corrected version, the `last_active` attribute will be initialized with the provided value if it is given; otherwise, it will default to the current time. This change should resolve the TypeError when calling the `prune` method with the `config` parameter.
