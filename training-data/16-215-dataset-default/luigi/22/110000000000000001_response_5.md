1. The buggy function is an __init__ method for a class, which initializes the class attributes. It seems to be missing the import statement for the time module.

2. The potential error location is in the assignment of self.started, which is using the time module without importing it.

3. The bug's cause is that time.time() is being used without importing the time module, which will result in a NameError.

4. One possible approach for fixing the bug is to import the time module at the beginning of the code or within the __init__ method before using time.time().

5. Corrected code:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
This corrected code adds the import statement for the time module at the beginning of the code and uses it within the __init__ method.
