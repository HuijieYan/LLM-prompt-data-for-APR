Potential error location: The 'last_active' parameter is set to None as the default value in the __init__ function, and then we are trying to add it to 'config.worker_disconnect_delay' in the prune function without checking if it is None or not.

Bug cause:
- The 'last_active' parameter is not being properly initialized or handled in the code, which leads to a TypeError when trying to add it to 'config.worker_disconnect_delay' in the prune function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if 'last_active' is None before performing any operations on it in the prune function.
2. Initialize 'last_active' in the __init__ function to a default value if it is not provided.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import time

# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            print("Pruning worker...")
```

With this corrected code, the failing test should pass without raising a TypeError.
