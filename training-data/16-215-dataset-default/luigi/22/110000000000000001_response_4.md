Potential error location: The issue lies in the use of the `time` module without importing it. This will result in a NameError when trying to use the `time.time()` method.

Bug's cause: The use of `time.time()` without importing the `time` module leads to a NameError as the `time` module is not recognized.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Import the `time` module at the beginning of the file.
2. Use a specific method of the `time` module, such as `time.time()` with the correct import.

Corrected code:
```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
In the corrected code, the `time` module is imported at the beginning of the file, and the `time.time()` method is used to set the `self.started` attribute within the `__init__` method.
