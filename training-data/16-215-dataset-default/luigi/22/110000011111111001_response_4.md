Potential error:
The error occurs because the `last_active` parameter is set as `None` in the `__init__` function, and then the `prune` function is trying to add the `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to it. This causes a `TypeError` because `None` does not support addition with integers.

Bug's cause:
The `last_active` parameter should be initialized with the provided value or set to the current time if no value is provided.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Set a default value for `last_active` in the `__init__` function.
2. Handle the case when `last_active` is `None` in the `prune` function.

```python
# The corrected code of the buggy function
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            pass  # implement the prune logic here
```

This corrected code initializes `last_active` with the provided value if it's not None, otherwise, it sets it to the current time. This change will ensure that the `prune` function does not encounter a `TypeError` when trying to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to `last_active`.
