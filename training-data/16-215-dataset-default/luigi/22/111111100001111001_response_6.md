The potential error location is the initialization of the `last_active` and `started` variables. It seems that the `last_active` variable is being set correctly to the input parameter, but the `started` variable is being set to the current time using `time.time()` without any input parameter, leading to a discrepancy in the expected and actual values.

To fix the bug, the `started` variable should be set to the input parameter `last_active` if it is provided, otherwise it should be set to the current time using `time.time()`.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
