The problem with the buggy function is that it is not importing the `time` module, so the `time.time()` call is failing. We need to import the `time` module to use the `time.time()` function.

Here is the corrected code for the function, which now includes the import statement for the `time` module:

```python
import time

class Scheduler:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this corrected code, the function now imports the `time` module and uses the `time.time()` function to initialize the `started` variable. This should resolve the issue and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
