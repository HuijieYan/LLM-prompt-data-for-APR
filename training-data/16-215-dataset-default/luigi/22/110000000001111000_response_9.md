# The corrected version of the function
```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
The issue in the original code is that the `__init__` function is not inside a class definition, hence the introduction of the `class Worker` definition. Additionally, the `import time` statement is added at the top of the code to enable the use of `time.time()` function.
