The potential error location within the function is the initialization of the `self.started` variable. It is supposed to be set to the current time when the object is created, but it is currently not being set correctly.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not importing the `time` module, so the `time.time()` function is not recognized. This results in `self.started` being assigned the value of `None`.

To fix the bug, the `time` module needs to be imported at the beginning of the code. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `self.started` variable will be initialized with the current time as expected.
