The potential error in the given function is that the `time` module has not been imported, so the `time.time()` function call will result in an error. Additionally, the `__init__` method is missing the `self` parameter.

To fix the bug, the `time` module needs to be imported and the `__init__` method needs to have the `self` parameter added.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this corrected code, the function now properly initializes the `Worker` object with the expected input/output variable values.
