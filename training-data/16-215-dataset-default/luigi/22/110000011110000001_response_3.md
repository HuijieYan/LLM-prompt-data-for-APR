1. The problematic function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class from the `luigi.scheduler` module. It initializes the attributes of the Worker class such as `id`, `reference`, `last_active`, `started`, `tasks`, and `info`. The failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` calls the `prune` method of the `Worker` class, which attempts to calculate the time difference between `self.last_active` and the current time.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the initialization of the `last_active` attribute.

3. The bug is caused by the fact that the `last_active` attribute is initialized with a default value of `None` in the `__init__` method, and when the `prune` method is called with `config.worker_disconnect_delay`, it tries to perform an operation using a `NoneType` and an `int`, resulting in a `TypeError`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug are:
   - Initializing `last_active` with a default value that can be used for comparison, such as `0` or the current time.
   - Ensuring that the `prune` method handles the case where `last_active` is `None` before performing any operations on it.

5. Corrected code for the `Worker` class:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # perform pruning operation
            pass
```

With the corrected code, the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class checks if the `last_active` parameter is provided, and if not, it initializes it with the current time using `time.time()`. This ensures that `last_active` is always an integer value for comparison in the `prune` method. This corrected code should pass the failing test.
