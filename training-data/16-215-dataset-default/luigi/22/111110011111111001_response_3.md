The bug in the code is caused by the `last_active` variable being assigned a default value of `None` in the `__init__` function. When the `prune` function is called, it tries to add the `last_active` value and `config.worker_disconnect_delay`, resulting in a `TypeError` due to `NoneType` not being compatible with `int`.

To fix this bug, the `last_active` variable should be assigned the current time only if it's not provided as an argument. We can use an `if...else` statement to achieve this.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` variable will be assigned the current time if no value is provided, preventing the `TypeError` when calling the `prune` function.
