The bug in the provided function is that it's trying to use the `time` module without importing it. This causes the `time.time()` call to fail because the `time` module is not defined.

To fix this bug, we need to import the `time` module at the beginning of the Python file. Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import time  # import the time module

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the function will now work as expected and satisfy the provided expected input/output variable information.
