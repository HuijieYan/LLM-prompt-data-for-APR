The potential error in the buggy function is that it is trying to use the `time` module without importing it. This causes the `time.time()` call to fail, resulting in an AttributeError.

To fix the bug, we need to import the `time` module at the beginning of the file.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
import time  # Import the time module

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()  # This line now works properly
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
```

With this corrected code, the function will now return the expected values and types for the given input parameters.
