Potential errors in the provided function:
1. The import statement for the `time` module is missing, so `time.time()` will raise an error.
2. The `last_active` parameter has a default value of None, which may lead to unexpected behavior when subtracting it from `time.time()`.

To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Import the `time` module at the beginning of the file
2. Check if the `last_active` parameter is None, and if so, set it to the current time.

Corrected code:

```python
import time  # Add the import statement for the time module

# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

In the corrected code, we added the import statement for the `time` module at the beginning of the file. Inside the `__init__` method, we check if the `last_active` parameter is None, and if so, we set it to the current time using `time.time()`. This will ensure that the `last_active` attribute is properly initialized.
