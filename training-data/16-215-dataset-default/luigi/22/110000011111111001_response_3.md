The issue is that the `last_active` parameter is by default set to `None`, and in the `prune` function, it attempts to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to `self.last_active` without checking if `self.last_active` is `None`. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to add an `int` to a `NoneType`.

To fix this issue, we need to handle the case when `last_active` is `None` in the `__init__` function and provide a default value for `last_active` to avoid the `TypeError` in the `prune` function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            ...
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter is now initialized to the current time using `time.time()` if it is `None`. This should resolve the `TypeError` issue and the function should now pass the failing test.
