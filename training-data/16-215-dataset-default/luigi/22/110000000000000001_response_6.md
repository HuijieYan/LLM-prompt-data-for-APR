1. The problematic function is an initializer function for a class, but it has a few issues. 
2. The potential error location is in the default argument `last_active=None` which is a mutable data type and could cause unexpected behavior.
3. The buggy function is not initializing the class attributes properly and also has a potential issue with the use of the default argument.

The bug's cause is that the `last_active` parameter is set to a mutable data type and could lead to unexpected behavior, and the function does not properly initialize all class attributes.

4. To fix the bug, we can remove the default argument for `last_active` and initialize all class attributes within the `__init__` function.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

In the corrected code, we have removed the default argument for `last_active` and used an if-else statement to handle the case when `last_active` is `None`. We have also properly initialized all the class attributes within the `__init__` function.
