The issue with the buggy function is that the `last_active` parameter has a default value of `None`, which causes a TypeError when trying to add it to `config.worker_disconnect_delay` in the `prune` method. 

To fix this, we need to ensure that `last_active` is always initialized to a valid value, even if the `last_active` parameter is not provided when the Worker object is instantiated.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `__init__` method of the Worker class as follows:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this modification, if the `last_active` parameter is not provided, it will default to the current time, avoiding the TypeError in the `prune` method. This change ensures that the `last_active` parameter always has a valid value.

After applying this change, the Worker class should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
