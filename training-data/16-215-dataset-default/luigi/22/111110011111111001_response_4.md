The bug is caused by the fact that the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method is set to `None` by default. When the `prune` method is called, it tries to add `None` to an integer (config.worker_disconnect_delay) which results in a `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `__init__` method to initialize `last_active` to the current time if it's not provided.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With the corrected code, the `last_active` parameter is set to `time.time()` if it's not provided, ensuring that it's always a valid value regardless of whether it's explicitly provided or not.
