The potential error in the provided code is that the function is trying to access the `time` module without importing it. This is evident from the line `self.started = time.time()` in the code.

To fix this bug, we need to import the `time` module at the beginning of the file.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py
import time  # import the time module

# the corrected function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By importing the `time` module at the beginning of the file, the bug is fixed and the function should work as intended.
