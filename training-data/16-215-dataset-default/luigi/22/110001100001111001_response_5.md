The potential error location in the buggy function is the assignment of the value of `last_active` to the variable `self.last_active`. 

The cause of the bug is that the value of `last_active` is being directly assigned to `self.last_active` without checking if it is None. This could cause issues if `last_active` is not provided as an input.

To fix the bug, we should check if `last_active` is None. If it is None, we can assign the current time to `self.last_active` instead.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import time

class Scheduler:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = time.time()
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active
        
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

# Verify that the corrected function outputs the expected values
worker_id = 123
last_active = 1702321538.4872892
scheduler = Scheduler(worker_id, last_active)

print(scheduler.id)  # Output: 123
print(scheduler.last_active)  # Output: 1702321538.4872892
print(scheduler.started)  # Output: Current time in seconds since epoch
print(scheduler.tasks)  # Output: set()
print(scheduler.info)  # Output: {}
```
