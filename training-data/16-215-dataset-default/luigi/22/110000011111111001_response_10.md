The issue in the buggy function is that the last_active parameter is not being set properly and is defaulting to None. This causes an issue when trying to add it to a time value in the prune method.

To fix this bug, we need to properly set the last_active parameter in the __init__ method. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            pass
```

With this correction, the last_active time is properly initialized to the current time if it is not provided in the constructor. Therefore, the failing test should pass now.
