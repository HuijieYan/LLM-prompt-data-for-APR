1. The buggy function is the `__init__` method of a class, but it is missing the `import time` statement. Also, the `last_active` parameter is being set to None instead of being initialized to the current time.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of `time.time()` without importing the `time` module.

3. The bug's cause is that the `time` module is not imported, and the `last_active` parameter is not being initialized properly.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Import the `time` module at the beginning of the code.
   - Set the default value for `last_active` to `time.time()` if it's None.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import time  # import the time module

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world (currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
In the corrected code, we have imported the `time` module at the beginning of the code and fixed the initialization of the `last_active` parameter within the `__init__` method. Now, if `last_active` is None, it will be initialized to the current time using `time.time()`.
