The issue in the buggy function is that the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` as a default value in the function's signature. This causes an issue when trying to perform arithmetic operations with it in the `prune` method, as seen in the error message.

To fix this issue, we need to provide a default value for `last_active` that can be used in arithmetic operations. We can set it to the current time when the worker is initialized if no value is provided.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            pass  # Prune the worker
```

With this corrected code, the function should be able to pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. The `last_active` parameter is now defaulted to the current time if no value is provided, allowing for arithmetic operations to be performed on it.
