Potential Error Location:
The potential error is where the `prune` function is trying to access `self.last_active` which could be None.

Bug's Cause:
The `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is setting `last_active` to `None`, and the `prune` function is attempting to add an integer to `None`, resulting in a `TypeError`.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Set a default value for `last_active` in the `prune` function to avoid the `NoneType` error.
2. Update the `__init__` function to accept a default timestamp value for `last_active` if it is None.

Corrected Code:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # handling the prune logic
            pass
```

With this corrected code, the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` function checks if it is None, and if so, sets it to the current time using `time.time()`. This ensures that `last_active` always has a valid timestamp, and the `prune` function no longer produces a `TypeError`. This corrected code should now pass the failing test.
