The bug is caused by the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` as a default value, resulting in a `TypeError` when it is used in the `prune()` method. The `last_active` parameter needs to be properly initialized to a default value and then updated if a value is provided.

To fix the bug, we need to initialize `last_active` to the current time if no value is provided. Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` function:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter is properly initialized to the current time if no value is provided, fixing the `TypeError` that was occurring in the failing test. This corrected code should satisfy the expected input/output variable information and pass the failing test.
