The issue with the `prune` function occurs because `self.last_active` can be `None` and the code does not handle this case. When `last_active` is not provided as an argument to the `Worker` class, it defaults to None. This is why the error message shows `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'int'`

We need to modify the `__init__` function to handle the default value for `last_active` properly. We can set `self.last_active` to `time.time()` if `last_active` is not provided. 

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` function:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this modification, the code properly handles the default value for `last_active` and should pass the failing test.
