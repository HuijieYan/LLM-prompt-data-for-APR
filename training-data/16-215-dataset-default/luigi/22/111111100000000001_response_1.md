The potential error in the __init__ function is that it references the time module (time.time()) without importing it. This will result in a NameError when the class is instantiated.

To fix this bug, we need to import the time module at the beginning of the file.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

import time  # Needed to use the time module

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By importing the time module at the beginning of the file, the time.time() function will now work properly without raising a NameError, fixing the bug in the __init__ function.
