The issue with the given function is that the default value of `None` for the `last_active` parameter causes a `TypeError` when trying to add it to `config.worker_disconnect_delay` in the `prune` method. This is because `None` cannot be added to an integer.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that `last_active` is initialized with a valid timestamp instead of `None`. We can use the `time.time()` function to get the current timestamp as the default value for `last_active`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is None:
            last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            pass # Do something here
```

With this fix, the `last_active` parameter is initialized with the current timestamp if no value is provided, ensuring that it does not cause a `TypeError` when used in the `prune` method. This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
