The buggy function is the __init__ function within the Worker class. The error is occurring in the prune method of the Worker class when trying to add the value of last_active (which is initially set to None) to the config.worker_disconnect_delay. This is causing a TypeError due to the unsupported operand types for the addition of NoneType and int.

The cause of the bug is that the last_active attribute of the Worker class is being initialized as None, and when it is used in the prune method before being assigned a valid value, it causes the TypeError.

One possible approach to fix this bug is by providing a default value for last_active in the __init__ method, so that if no value is provided, it will default to the current time. Another approach is to handle the case when last_active is None in the prune method.

Here's the corrected code for the __init__ function within the Worker class:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

This correction will set the last_active attribute to the current time if no value is provided, fixing the TypeError in the prune method.
