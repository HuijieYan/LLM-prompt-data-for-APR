1. The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. The failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` is trying to initialize a `Worker` object with an `id` of 123 and then calling the `prune` method of the `Worker` object with a `TmpCfg` object.

2. The potential error location is identified as the initialization of the `last_active` attribute in the `__init__` method. It is being initialized with a default value of `None` which causes the TypeError when trying to perform addition/subtraction operations with it.

3. The cause of the bug is due to the `last_active` attribute being initialized as `None` in the `__init__` method, which causes a TypeError when trying to perform arithmetic operations on it within the `prune` method. The failing test is trying to call `prune` with a `TmpCfg` object and the error message indicates a TypeError due to unsupported operand types for `+`, specifically with a `NoneType` and an `int`.

4. To fix the bug, the `last_active` attribute should be initialized with a proper default value that can be used in arithmetic operations without causing a TypeError.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:
   
```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch if last_active is None
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # pruning logic here
            pass  # placeholder for pruning logic
```
With this corrected code, the `last_active` attribute is initialized with the current time if the `last_active` argument is not provided, thereby avoiding the `NoneType` issue when performing arithmetic operations. This should allow the failing test to pass successfully.
