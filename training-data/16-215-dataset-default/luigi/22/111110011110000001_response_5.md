1. The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. The failing test is trying to create a `Worker` object and then call the `prune` method on it, but the `prune` method attempts to add the `last_active` attribute of the `Worker` object with a configured delay, resulting in a `TypeError`.

2. The potential error location is within the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class, where the `last_active` attribute is set to `None`.

3. The cause of the bug is:
   - (a). The buggy function initializes the `last_active` attribute with a default value of `None`.
   - (b). The buggy class is the `Worker` class, which initializes the `last_active` attribute to `None`.
   - (c). The failing test attempts to call the `prune` method on a `Worker` object and add the `last_active` attribute (which is `None`) with a delay value.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Set a default value for the `last_active` attribute that can be added with the configured delay without causing a `TypeError`, such as 0.
   - Check for `None` in the `prune` method and handle it appropriately.

5. Corrected code for the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class:
```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=0):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this corrected code, the `last_active` attribute is initialized with a default value of 0, which can be added with the delay value without causing a `TypeError`. This will make the failing test pass.
