The issue with the provided buggy function is that the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default, but it is used in a comparison without being checked for `None` before being used in the `prune` method.

The error message indicates that the comparison of `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay` is failing because `self.last_active` is of type `NoneType`, which is not supported for the `+` operation.

To fix this, we need to check if `last_active` is `None` and handle it accordingly. We can modify the function as follows:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform pruning action here
            pass
```

With this modification, the `last_active` parameter defaults to the current time if it is `None`, which will prevent the `TypeError` when performing the comparison in the failing test. The function now also satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided.
