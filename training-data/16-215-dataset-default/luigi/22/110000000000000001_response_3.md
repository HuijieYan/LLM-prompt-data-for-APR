1. The buggy function is supposed to be a constructor for a class, but it is missing the class definition and the import statement for the time module.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of the time module without importing it.

3. The bug's cause is that the time module is used without being imported, which will raise a NameError when the code is executed.

4. To fix the bug, we need to import the time module at the beginning of the file and properly define the class that contains the constructor function.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
import time  # import the time module

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By importing the time module and properly defining the class, we have fixed the bug in the provided function.
