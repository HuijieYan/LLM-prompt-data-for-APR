1. The buggy function is the __init__ method of the Worker class. It initializes the Worker object with various attributes like worker_id, last_active, reference, started, tasks, and info.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the assignment of the attribute "started" using the time.time() method without importing the time module.

3. Bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function initializes the "started" attribute using the time.time() method without importing the time module.
   (b). The Worker class is missing the import statement for the time module.
   (c). The related functions that utilize the Worker class might encounter issues related to the incorrect initialization of the "started" attribute.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Import the time module at the beginning of the file.
   (b). Correctly initialize the "started" attribute using the time.time() method within the buggy function.
   (c). Ensure that all related functions utilizing the Worker class are compatible with the corrected attribute initialization.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import time

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

In the corrected code, the time module has been imported at the beginning of the file, and the "started" attribute is initialized using the time.time() method within the buggy function. This should resolve the buggy behavior in the original implementation.
