Potential error location: The function is trying to use the `time` module without importing it, resulting in a `NameError`.

Bug Cause:
(a) The buggy function is attempting to use the `time` module without importing it.
(b) The class `Worker` has an `__init__` method that tries to use the `time` module without importing it.
(c) The buggy function is not importing the `time` module, which is causing the `NameError`.

Approach for fixing the bug:
Import the `time` module at the beginning of the file to resolve the `NameError`.

Corrected code:

```python
import time  # Add this import statement at the beginning of the file

# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    # The corrected version of the buggy function
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
After making these changes, the `time` module will be properly imported, and the `time.time()` function will work correctly within the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class.
