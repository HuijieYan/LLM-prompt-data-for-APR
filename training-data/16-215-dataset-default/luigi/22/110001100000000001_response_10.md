The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of the `time` module without importing it. This is causing a NameError when trying to access `time.time()`.

To fix the bug, we need to import the `time` module at the beginning of the file.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import time

class Scheduler:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By importing the `time` module at the beginning of the file, the `time.time()` function can now be used without any issues.
