The bug in the provided function is that it tries to use the `time` module without importing it, causing a NameError. To fix this, we need to import the `time` module at the beginning of the file.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the function should now work as expected and satisfy the provided input/output information.
