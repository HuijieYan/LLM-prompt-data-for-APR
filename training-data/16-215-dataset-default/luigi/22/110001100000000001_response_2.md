The potential error in the provided function is that the `time` module is used without being imported, which will result in a NameError when the function is called. This can be validated by analyzing the function and its usage of the `time` module.

To fix the bug, the `time` module needs to be imported at the beginning of the file. Additionally, since `time` is part of the standard Python library, no external installation or dependencies are required.

Here's the corrected code with the `time` module imported:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py
import time  # import the time module

# this is the corrected function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With the `time` module imported, the `time.time()` function call will now work correctly without causing a NameError.
