The potential error location within the problematic function is the line: `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time()`

The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` attribute of the Worker class is initialized as `None`, and when trying to add the `worker_disconnect_delay` to it, it causes a TypeError since you cannot add an integer to a NoneType.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `last_active` is None before trying to perform the addition operation.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
            pass
```

With this corrected code, the test should now pass without throwing a TypeError.
