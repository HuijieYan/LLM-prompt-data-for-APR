1. The buggy function is an `__init__` method for a `Worker` class. The function initializes various attributes of the `Worker` object, including `id`, `reference`, `last_active`, `started`, `tasks`, and `info`. The failing test is trying to prune the worker, which involves checking whether the worker's `last_active` time is greater than the time obtained from the config variable. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to adding `NoneType` and `int`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the initialization of the `last_active` attribute with a default value of `None` and then trying to use it in the `prune` method without checking if it has been set to a specific value.

3. Bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function initializes `last_active` with a default value of `None`.
   (b). In the failing test, when the `prune` method is called, it tries to add the `last_active` (which is `None`) and `config.worker_disconnect_delay` (an int), resulting in the `TypeError`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the `prune` method to handle the case when `last_active` is `None`.
   - Ensure that `last_active` is set to a proper initial value during the instantiation of the `Worker` object.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
        
    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # prune the worker
            print("Worker pruned")
        else:
            print("Worker not pruned")

# Instantiate the Worker and test the prune method
worker = Worker(123)
class TmpCfg:
    def __init__(self):
        self.worker_disconnect_delay = 10

worker.prune(TmpCfg())
```

This corrected version checks if `last_active` is not `None` before performing the time comparison in the `prune` method. This change ensures that the AttributeError is avoided and the method behaves as expected.
