The issue with the `__init__` function is that it references `time.time()` directly without importing the `time` module. This causes the function to fail when trying to access `time.time()`.

To fix this bug, we need to import the `time` module at the beginning of the file.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import time

class ClassName:
    # The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the function should now work as expected and satisfy the provided expected input/output variable information.
