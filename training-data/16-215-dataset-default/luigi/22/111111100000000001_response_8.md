Potential error location: The error is likely to be in the line `self.started = time.time()` as the `time` module has not been imported, and this line will cause a NameError.

Bug cause:
The buggy function is trying to use the `time` module to get the current time using `time.time()` without importing the module. This will result in a NameError because the `time` module has not been imported.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Import the `time` module at the beginning of the file using `import time`.
2. Use `datetime` module instead of `time` module to get the current time.

Corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

import time  # import the time module

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
