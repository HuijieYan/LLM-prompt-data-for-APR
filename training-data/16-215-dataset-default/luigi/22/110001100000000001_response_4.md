1. The buggy function is an initializer for a class in the luigi.scheduler module. It takes worker_id and last_active as parameters and initializes various attributes of the worker object.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be the last_active parameter being set to a mutable default value (None).

3. The potential cause of the bug is that when last_active is set to None, it may not be properly handled in the rest of the code. This could lead to unexpected behavior when the last_active parameter is used in calculations or comparisons in the related functions.

4. To fix the bug, we can make sure to handle the case where last_active is None properly, or provide a default value that represents an "uninitialized" state of last_active.

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

In the corrected code, we use the current time as the default value for last_active if None is provided, ensuring that it always has a valid value. This prevents any unexpected behavior related to None being used as the value for last_active.
