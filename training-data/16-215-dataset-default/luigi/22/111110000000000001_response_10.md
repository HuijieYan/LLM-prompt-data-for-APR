Potential error location: The problematic function is trying to set the attribute 'started' using the function 'time.time()' without importing the 'time' module.

Bug's cause: The 'time' module is being used without being imported, causing the 'time.time()' function to fail and resulting in an AttributeError.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Import the 'time' module at the beginning of the script to make the 'time.time()' function callable.

Corrected code:

```python
# Import the time module
import time

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    # The corrected function
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
