Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the buggy function is that it is trying to access the `time` module without importing it. As a result, it will raise a NameError when trying to execute the `time.time()` method.

Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is that the `time` module is not imported in the buggy function, and therefore, the `time.time()` method is not accessible.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
The bug can be fixed by importing the `time` module at the beginning of the `luigi/scheduler.py` file or at the beginning of the `Worker` class.

Corrected Code:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

import time  # Importing the time module

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    # this is the corrected function
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
By adding the import statement at the beginning of the `luigi/scheduler.py` file, the bug is fixed, and the `time.time()` method can be accessed correctly within the `Worker` class.
