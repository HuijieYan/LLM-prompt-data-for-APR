Potential error location: The buggy function is missing the import statement for the time module, so the time.time() method cannot be used without it.

Bug's cause: The bug is caused by the missing import statement for the time module, which is required for using the time.time() method in the class.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Import the time module at the beginning of the file to use the time.time() method.

Corrected code:

```python
import time  # import the time module

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
After importing the time module, the class should work correctly and the time.time() method can be used to initialize the 'started' attribute.
