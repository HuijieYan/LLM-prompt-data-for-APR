Potential error location: The `last_active` parameter is set to `None` as default, and this causes a `TypeError` when trying to add it to a `time.time()` value in the `prune` method.

Bug's cause:
- The `last_active` parameter is set to `None` as default, and that causes an issue when trying to use it in the `prune` method.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
- Update the default value for `last_active` to be `time.time()` so that it's always a valid float value.

Corrected code:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=time.time()):  # set last_active's default value to time.time()
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            pass  # actual prune code would go here
```
With this update, the `last_active` parameter will default to the current time when not provided, ensuring that it's always a valid float value. This will make the `prune` method work as expected and pass the failing test.
