Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
import time

class Scheduler:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.worker_id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

I made the following changes:
1. Changed the function definition to a class definition and named it Scheduler.
2. Renamed the "self.id" attribute to "self.worker_id" to be consistent with the variable name used in the function parameters.
