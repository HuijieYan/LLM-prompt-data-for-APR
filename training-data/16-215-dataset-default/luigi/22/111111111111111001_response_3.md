The issue with the buggy function is that the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default, and when the `prune()` function is called, it tries to perform an operation on `None` and an integer, which leads to a `TypeError`.

To fix the bug, we can initialize `last_active` with the current time if it is not provided when the Worker object is created.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            pass  # Implement the prune logic here

# The prune function's implementation is not provided here as it was not necessary for fixing the bug.
```

The corrected version of the `__init__` function initializes `last_active` to the current time using `time.time()` if it is not provided when creating the Worker object. This will ensure that the `last_active` is always initialized with a valid value and prevent the TypeError when the `prune()` function is called.

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
