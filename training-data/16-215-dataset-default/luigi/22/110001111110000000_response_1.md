```python
import time

# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            pass # Add code here
```
In the fixed version, I converted the `last_active` to the current time if it is `None` when passed into the `__init__` method. This should fix the `TypeError` shown in the failing test.
