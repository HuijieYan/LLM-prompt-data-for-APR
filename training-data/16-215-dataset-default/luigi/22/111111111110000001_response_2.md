The potential error location is within the '__init__' function of the Worker class. The error message indicates that the 'last_active' attribute is of type 'NoneType', and the code is trying to add it to an integer value. This suggests that the 'last_active' attribute was not properly initialized.

The bug is caused because the 'last_active' attribute in the '__init__' function is set to 'None' by default, and the 'prune' function is trying to add the 'worker_disconnect_delay' to it, resulting in a TypeError.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that 'last_active' is properly initialized with a valid timestamp when the Worker object is created. We can do this by using the 'time.time()' function to set the 'last_active' attribute if it is not provided during initialization.

Here's the corrected code for the '__init__' function:

```python
import time  # Import the time module

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this modification, the 'last_active' attribute will be initialized with the current timestamp if it is not provided during the creation of a Worker object.

This corrected code should pass the failing test.
