The issue in the buggy function is that the `last_active` parameter is being set to `None` by default, and then it's being used in a comparison without checking for `None` first. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to add an `int` to `None`.

To fix this bug, we should check if `last_active` is `None` before performing any operations on it, and if it is `None`, set it to the current time.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            self.delete_worker()
```

With this corrected code, the `prune` method will check if `last_active` is `None` before performing any operations on it, and if it is `None`, it will set it to the current time. This should fix the `TypeError` that was occurring in the failing test.
