The potential error in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is that the `time` module is not imported, so the `time.time()` call is causing an error. This is likely the cause of the discrepancies between the expected and actual input/output variable values.

To fix this bug, we need to import the `time` module at the beginning of the file. Once this is done, the `time.time()` call will work correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` function:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this change, the `time` module is imported, and the `time.time()` call will work as expected, satisfying the expected input/output variable information provided.
