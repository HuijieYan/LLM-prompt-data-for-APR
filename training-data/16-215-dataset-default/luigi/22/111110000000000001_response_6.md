1. The buggy function is the __init__ constructor for the Worker class. It initializes various attributes for a Worker object such as worker_id, last_active time, started time, tasks, and info. However, it is missing the import for the time module.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line "self.started = time.time()" as it is using the time module without importing it.

3. (a) The buggy function is trying to initialize the 'started' attribute with the current time using the time.time() function.
   (b) The buggy class is a structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references. The __init__ function sets up various attributes for a Worker object.

4. To fix the bug, we need to import the time module at the beginning of the script to use the time.time() function. Additionally, we should consider providing a default value for the last_active parameter in the __init__ function if it is not provided during object creation.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
