The buggy function is a class constructor that initializes the attributes of a worker object. It takes a worker_id and an optional last_active time as input. The bug is located in the initialization of the 'started' attribute, as it is set to the current time using 'time.time()' without importing the time module.

The cause of the bug is that the time module needs to be imported in order to use the 'time.time()' function. This results in 'time.time()' being unrecognized, and as a result, it doesn't set the 'started' attribute correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to import the time module and use 'time.time()' to get the current time for the 'started' attribute.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this corrected code, the function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
