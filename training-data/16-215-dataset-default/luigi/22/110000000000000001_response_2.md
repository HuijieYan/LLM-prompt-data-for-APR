Potential Error location: 
The potential error is that the 'time' module has not been imported, so the function will fail to execute.

Bug Cause:
The 'time' module has not been imported, so the function will fail to execute as it uses the 'time' module for time related operations.

Possible Approaches for fixing the bug:
Import the 'time' module at the beginning of the code so that the function can use it for time-related operations.

Corrected code:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
