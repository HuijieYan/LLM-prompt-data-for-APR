The potential error in the buggy function is that the last_active parameter is not being correctly assigned to the last_active instance variable. Instead, it is being assigned to the started instance variable. This is causing the discrepancy between the expected and actual input/output variable values.

To fix this bug, we need to correct the assignment of the last_active and started variables in the __init__ function.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
import time

class Scheduler:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this corrected code, the buggy function now correctly initializes the instance variables according to the expected input/output variable information provided.
