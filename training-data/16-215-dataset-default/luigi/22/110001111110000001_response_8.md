The potential error in the buggy function is with the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` by default, and then trying to perform arithmetic operations on it inside the `prune` method. 

The `prune` method in the failing test is expecting `last_active` to be an `int` representing the time in seconds since epoch, but since it is set to `None` in the `__init__` method, it causes a `TypeError` when trying to add it to an `int` in the `prune` method.

To fix this bug, the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method should be set to the current time in seconds since epoch if no value is provided, rather than `None`.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will default to the current time if no value is provided, avoiding the TypeError when the `prune` method tries to perform arithmetic operations on it.

This corrected code should make the failing test pass.
