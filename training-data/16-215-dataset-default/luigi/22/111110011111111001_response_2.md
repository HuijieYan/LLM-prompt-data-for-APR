1. The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. The failing test creates a `Worker` instance and then calls the `prune` method on it. The error message indicates that the `TypeError` is caused by attempting to add a `NoneType` (the default value of `last_active`) with an integer. The expected and actual input/output variable information helps identify the potential error location within the problematic function, and the error is caused by the `last_active` variable not being properly initialized.

2. The potential error location within the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class is the `last_active` variable not being assigned a default value in the `__init__` method.

3. The bug's cause is that the `last_active` variable is being set to `None`, and it is not being properly handled when the `prune` method is called. The failing test and error message confirm this as it shows that the code is attempting to add `None` with an integer, resulting in a `TypeError`. The expected and actual input/output variable value shows that `last_active` is indeed set to `None`, causing the issue when it is used in the `prune` method.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is set to a default value in the `__init__` method. We can set it to the current time when it is not provided.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this corrected code, the `last_active` variable is properly initialized in the `__init__` method, and it will now have a default value of the current time if not provided. This will ensure that the failing test is passed and that the expected input/output variable information is satisfied.
