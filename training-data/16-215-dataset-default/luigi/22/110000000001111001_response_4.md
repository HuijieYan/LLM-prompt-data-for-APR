Upon analyzing the buggy function and the expected/actual input/output variable information, the potential error location within the problematic function is coming from the incorrect initialization of the `last_active` and `started` variables.

The bug's cause is that the `last_active` variable is being incorrectly initialized with the input `last_active` value when it should default to `None`. Additionally, the `started` variable is being initialized incorrectly with the current time using `time.time()`.

To fix the bug, we should update the function to provide a default value of `None` for the `last_active` parameter, and set the `started` variable inside the `__init__` function to the current time using `time.time()`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

Now, the function should satisfy the expected input/output variable information and correctly initialize the `last_active` and `started` variables.
