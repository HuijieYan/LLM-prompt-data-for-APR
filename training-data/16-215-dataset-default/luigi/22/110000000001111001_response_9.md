The potential error in the buggy function is the use of time.time() to initialize the variable self.started. Since time.time() gives the current time in seconds since epoch, it should be used to assign the value of last_active instead of started.

The bug's cause is that the value of self.started is being set to the current time in seconds since epoch instead of the default value of None. This causes a discrepancy between the expected and actual output as seen in case 1.

To fix the bug, we need to change the assignment of self.started and last_active. We should also import the time module to use the time.time() function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = None  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this corrected code, the function will now return the expected values for the provided input parameters.
