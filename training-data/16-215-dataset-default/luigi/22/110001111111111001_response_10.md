The issue with the buggy function is that it doesn't handle the case where the `last_active` parameter is not provided when initializing a Worker object. The failing test is trying to call the `prune` method on a Worker object with a `config` parameter, which uses the `worker_disconnect_delay` value from the config class. Inside the `prune` method, there is a comparison between `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay` and `time.time()`. Since `last_active` is initially None, this comparison results in a TypeError.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that `last_active` is initialized properly and handle the case where it is None in the `prune` method.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import time

# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py
class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # prune the worker
            pass
```

With this corrected code, the `__init__` method now checks if `last_active` is None, and if so, sets it to the current time using `time.time()`. This ensures that the `last_active` parameter is always valid. The `prune` method comparison will now be able to handle this properly and the failing test should pass.

This corrected code satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided and should fix the bug.
