1. The function is intended to initialize a worker object with worker ID, last active time, and other attributes. However, there are some potential issues in the function.

2. The potential error location within the function is the initialization of the 'last_active' attribute. It is being set to a mutable default value (None), which may lead to unexpected behavior.

3. The bug's cause is that the default parameter 'last_active=None' can lead to unexpected behavior. When the 'last_active' parameter is not provided, it defaults to None, and this may cause issues when comparing or using it.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Remove the default value of 'None' for the 'last_active' parameter and handle the case of it not being provided separately in the code.
   b. Use a default value for 'last_active' that is not mutable, such as a specific timestamp.

5. Corrected code:
```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
In the corrected code, the default value for 'last_active' is removed, and it is checked for None while initializing the object. If 'last_active' is None, the current time is used as its value. This ensures that the 'last_active' attribute is not initialized to a mutable default value.
