1. The problematic function `__init__` is used to initialize the `Worker` class. The failing test is trying to call the `prune` method on the `Worker` object, but it fails with a TypeError because `self.last_active` is None and it tries to add it to `config.worker_disconnect_delay`, which is an integer.

2. The potential error location is identified in the `__init__` function, where `last_active` is set to None.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` parameter has a default value of None in the `__init__` function, and the `prune` method is expecting it to be a valid integer.

4. To fix the bug, the `last_active` parameter should be set to the current time if it is not provided during initialization. This can be done using a simple if statement in the `__init__` function.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic `__init__` function:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # prune the worker
            pass
```

With this change, the `last_active` parameter is set to the current time if it is not provided during initialization, ensuring that it is always a valid integer when used in the `prune` method. This corrected code should pass the failing test.
