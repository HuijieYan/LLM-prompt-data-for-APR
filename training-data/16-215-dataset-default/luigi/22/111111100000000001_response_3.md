1. The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. This method is used to initialize the attributes of a new Worker object.

2. The potential error in the problematic function is that the `time` module is being used without being imported. This will cause a NameError when trying to access `time.time()`.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `time` module needs to be imported for the `time.time()` method to work. Additionally, the `last_active` parameter is defaulting to `None` instead of the current time when no value is provided.

4. To fix the bug, we can import the `time` module and set `last_active` to the current time if no value is provided.

5. Here is the corrected code:
```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
In the corrected code, the `time` module is imported at the beginning of the file, and the `last_active` parameter is assigned the current time using `time.time()` if no value is provided.
