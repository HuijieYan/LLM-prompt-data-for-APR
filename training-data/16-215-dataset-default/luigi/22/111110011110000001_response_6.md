1. The `prune` method is trying to access the `last_active` attribute of the Worker class, which is initialized as `None`. This is causing a `TypeError` when trying to add `None` to an integer in the `prune` method.

2. The potential error location is the `self.last_active` attribute within the `prune` method.

3. The bug's cause is that the `last_active` attribute is initialized as `None`, and then the `prune` method tries to add an integer to `None`, resulting in a `TypeError` when comparing the time.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is initialized with an appropriate value when the Worker object is created, and handle the case when `last_active` is `None` in the `prune` method.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` and `prune` methods:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
        
    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # perform pruning operations
            pass
```

With this corrected code, the `last_active` attribute is initialized with the current time if it's initially set as `None`, resolving the `TypeError` in the `prune` method.
