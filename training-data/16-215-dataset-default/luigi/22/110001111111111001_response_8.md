The potential error location within the problematic function is at the initialization of the last_active parameter. In the failing test, it's trying to add the last_active time to the worker_disconnect_delay, but last_active is initialized as None, causing a TypeError. 

To fix the bug, we need to update the initialization of the last_active parameter to be the current time if it is not provided during object creation.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = time.time() if last_active is None else last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Do something here
            pass
```

With this corrected code, the failing test should pass as it will no longer encounter a TypeError due to the initialization of last_active.
