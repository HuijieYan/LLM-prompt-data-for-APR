The issue in the failing test is caused by the fact that the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is set to `None` by default. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to calculate `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay` in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is set to a default value that can be added to an integer without causing a `TypeError`. We can set it to 0 as the default value.

Corrected code for the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class:
```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=0):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this corrected code, the failing test should pass without causing a `TypeError` when trying to calculate `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay`.
