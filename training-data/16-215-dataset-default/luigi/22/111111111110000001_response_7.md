The potential error in the buggy function is that the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` function is set to default to `None`, and then it is used in the `prune` function without first checking if it is None. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to perform addition with `None` and an integer in the `prune` function.

To fix the bug, we can add a condition in the `prune` function to check if `last_active` is not None before performing the addition. Additionally, we need to import the `time` module in the `scheduler.py` file.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
import time  # Import the time module

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():  # Check if last_active is not None
            print("Pruning worker")  # Placeholder for prune action
```

With the corrected code above, the `prune` function will now first check if `last_active` is not None before performing the addition, which will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.

This corrected function should now pass the failing test provided.
