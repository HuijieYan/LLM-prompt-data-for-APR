The issue with the `prune` function is that `self.last_active` is being initialized as `None`, and when trying to calculate it `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay` we get the error `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'int'`.

To fix this, we can initialize `last_active` with a default value if it's not provided. We can use the current time in seconds since epoch as the default value.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # delete worker logic
            pass
```

This corrected code initializes `self.last_active` with the current time if no value is provided, resolving the `NoneType` error. Now the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
