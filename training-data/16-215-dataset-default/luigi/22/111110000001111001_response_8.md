The bug in the provided function is that the `time` module has not been imported, but it is being used in the `__init__` function. This causes the function to raise a `NameError` due to the missing `time` module.

To fix the bug, the `time` module needs to be imported at the beginning of the file.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
import time  # Import the time module

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

# Test that the corrected function satisfies the expected input/output variable information
worker = Worker(123, 1702321538.4872892)
print(worker.id)  # Output: 123
print(worker.last_active)  # Output: 1702321538.4872892
print(worker.started)  # Output: <current time in seconds>
print(worker.tasks)  # Output: set()
print(worker.info)  # Output: {}
```

With the `time` module imported, the `started` variable in the `__init__` function will now be set to the current time in seconds, which aligns with the expected values and types of the variables given in the failing test case.
