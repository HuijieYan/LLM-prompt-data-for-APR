The buggy function is the `__init__` constructor of the `Worker` class. The problem lies in the initialization of the `self.started` variable. The `time` module is not imported, so the call to `time.time()` is causing an error.

The bug's cause is the absence of the `time` module import, which leads to a `NameError` when trying to call `time.time()`.

To fix the bug, the `time` module needs to be imported at the beginning of the file where the `Worker` class is defined. The corrected code is as follows:

```python
import time

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    # The corrected function
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the code now properly initializes the `self.started` variable using the `time` module, and the function will satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
