The bug in the given function is that the 'time' module is not imported, but it is used to set the 'started' variable. This results in a NameError when the function is executed.

To fix the bug, we need to import the 'time' module in the scheduler.py file in which the buggy function is defined. Once the 'time' module is imported, the function will work as expected.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
import time  # import the time module

class Scheduler:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the function will work as expected and satisfy the provided test case.
