The bug in the provided function is that the `time` module is not imported, so the `time.time()` function call will raise an AttributeError. Additionally, the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned to `self.last_active` properly. 

To fix the bug, we need to import the `time` module, properly assign the `last_active` parameter to `self.last_active`, and update the `self.started` variable to use the `time.time()` function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import time  # Import the time module

def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # Assign last_active parameter to self.last_active
    self.started = time.time()  # Update self.started to use the time.time() function
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this corrected code, the function will now properly initialize the `self.last_active` and `self.started` variables, and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
