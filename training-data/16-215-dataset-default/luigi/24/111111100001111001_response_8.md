Potential error location: The potential error is in the way the `command` list is constructed. The function is not correctly formatting the dictionary items into a string within the list.

Bug's cause:
The function is not correctly formatting the dictionary items into a string within the list. It is missing the quotation marks around the key and value pairs.

Approach for fixing the bug:
The function should iterate over the dictionary items and format them as strings with the key-value pairs enclosed in double quotes.

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

The corrected code satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided for both Case 1 and Case 2.
