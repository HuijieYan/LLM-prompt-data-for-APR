The buggy function `_dict_arg` is not handling dictionary values correctly. The `for` loop inside the function overwrites the `value` variable that was passed as an argument which causes an assertion error in the tests.

The cause of the bug is how the dictionary values are being concatenated to the `command` list inside the function. As a result, the function does not properly handle the dictionary values when constructing the command.

To fix the bug, the function should append the values from the dictionary directly to the `command` list. Also, we need to fix the arguments in the `format` function to properly include the `prop` and `value`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name to `val` to avoid overwriting
            command += [name, '--{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Properly format the argument and append it to the command
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should handle dictionary values correctly and pass the failing tests.
