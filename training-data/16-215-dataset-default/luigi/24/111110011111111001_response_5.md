The issue with the current implementation of the `_dict_arg` function is that it surrounds each property and value with double quotes, which is not needed and causing the test failures due to the differences in expected and actual arguments in the test cases. This is evident from the comparison of the expected and actual values in the failing tests.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around each property and value pair.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With the above correction, the provided test cases are expected to pass and match the expected output.
