1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to take a dictionary `value` and convert it into a list of command line arguments for a Spark job. It iterates through the items in the dictionary and appends them to the `command` list in the format `"name='value'"`. However, the bug seems to be related to the variable naming conflict within the loop.

2. The potential error location is within the loop where `prop` and `value` are being assigned new values, conflicting with the function argument `value`.

3. The bug's cause is that the loop variable `value` is being re-assigned within the loop, which leads to a conflict with the function argument `value`. This causes unexpected behavior and incorrect command generation.

4. To fix the bug, we can rename the loop variable `value` to something else to avoid the conflict with the function argument `value`. Additionally, we can use a different approach to concatenate the command list.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():  # renamed 'prop' to 'key' and 'value' to 'val'
            command.append("{0}='{1}'".format(name, val))  # using append instead of +=
    return command
```
