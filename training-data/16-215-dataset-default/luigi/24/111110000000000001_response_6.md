1. The buggy function is a method within the SparkSubmitTask class. It is intended to create a command for submitting a Spark job with various arguments in a dictionary. However, the function currently has a bug that prevents it from working as intended.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line "command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]". This line is trying to add the arguments from the dictionary to the command list, but it is not doing so correctly.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function is reusing the variable name "value" within the for loop, which overrides the original function argument value. This leads to incorrect command construction and unexpected behavior.

4. To fix the bug, we should use a different variable name inside the for loop to avoid reassigning the original value argument. Additionally, we should also handle the case where the value is not a dictionary.

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

In the corrected code, we have renamed the loop variable inside the for loop to "val" to avoid reusing the original "value" argument. Additionally, we have added a check to handle the case where the value is not a dictionary.
