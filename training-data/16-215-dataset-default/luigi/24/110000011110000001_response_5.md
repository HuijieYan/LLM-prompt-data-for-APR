The potential error in the function is in the line where the command list is being generated. It seems that the function is adding extra double quotes around the values when building the command list, which is causing the test cases to fail.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to remove the extra double quotes when building the command list. Instead of adding quotes around the values, they should be added directly to the command list.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This should fix the issue by removing the extra quotes and building the command list in the expected format.
