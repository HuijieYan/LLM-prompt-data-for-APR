The buggy function _dict_arg is causing the test failure because it is not correctly formatting the command list. The function is intended to take a dictionary and convert it into a list, but the current implementation is adding unnecessary quotes around the values.

The bug's cause is that the function erroneously adds double quotes around the value when creating the command list from the dictionary, leading to a mismatch in the expected and actual command list when the test is run.

To fix the bug, the function should not add quotes around the values when creating the command list. Instead, it should directly format the string with the prop and value pairs.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now properly create the command list without unnecessary quotes, and it should pass the failing test.
