The problematic function `_dict_arg` is supposed to take in a name and a value, and if the value is a non-empty dictionary, it constructs a list of command by iterating over the dictionary items and appending them to the list. However, there are multiple issues with the current implementation.

The bug is caused by the incorrect formatting of the command list in the `_dict_arg` function. The function is not correctly handling the dictionary items and is using incorrect formatting for the command list. This results in discrepancies in the command list when compared with the expected output in the test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when constructing the command list, the dictionary items are correctly formatted and added to the list.

The corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function is as follows:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Corrected the formatting here
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly format the command list and pass the failing test cases.
