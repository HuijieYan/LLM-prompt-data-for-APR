The issue with the buggy function is that it incorrectly includes quotes in the command list for the dictionary items. The function assumes that the value is always a string, which is not the case. The correct approach is to only add quotes if the value is a string.

The function can be fixed by modifying the section where the command list is constructed. Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            if isinstance(val, str):
                command += [name, '--conf', '\"{0}={1}\"'.format(prop, val)]
            else:
                command += [name, '--conf', '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected function will now properly handle both string and non-string values from the input dictionary and construct the command list accordingly.

These changes are expected to resolve the issues faced in the failing test cases.
