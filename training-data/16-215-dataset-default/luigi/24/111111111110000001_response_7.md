The buggy function `_dict_arg` is attempting to construct a command for running a Spark job, but it has an issue with constructing command strings from the elements of the input `value` dictionary. It's incorrectly adding the curly braces in the value string.

The fix for this bug is to remove the curly braces from the value string when constructing the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    # ... (other functions and class definitions)

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Instead of: '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)
        return command
```

With this change, the original test cases should pass without any assertions failing.
