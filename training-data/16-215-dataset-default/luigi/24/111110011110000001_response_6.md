The buggy function is `_dict_arg` within the `SparkSubmitTask` class. The purpose of this function seems to be to convert a dictionary to a list of command line arguments.

The test functions are failing due to a mismatch of types in the generated command. The `_dict_arg` function is adding double quotes around the values when creating the command list. This is causing a mismatch between expected and actual commands.

To fix the bug, the function `_dict_arg` should be modified to not include double quotes around the values when creating the command list.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, p_value in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, p_value)]  # removed double quotes around values
    return command
```

With this change, the function should now correctly generate the command list without the mismatch of types and pass the failing test.
