The potential error in the buggy function is in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. The issue is that the values are being concatenated as strings without the required format.

The bug is caused by the incorrect formatting of the command list. The function is not adding the values in the correct format, leading to an incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]` to `command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]`, which will add the values in the correct format to the command list.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
