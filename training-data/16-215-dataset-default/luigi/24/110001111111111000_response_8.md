To fix the buggy function, you need to update the _dict_arg method. The problem here is related to the usage of double quotes around the key-value pair. We only want to add double quotes if the value contains spaces. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            # Check if the value contains spaces
            if ' ' in val:
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
            else:
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This modification ensures that double quotes are added only if the value contains spaces, which is the correct behavior based on the failing tests. After making this change, the function should correctly perform string formatting when constructing the command list.

This should fix the failing tests in the SparkSubmitTaskTest and SparkSubmitTaskTest classes.
