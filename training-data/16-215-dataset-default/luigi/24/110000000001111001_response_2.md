The bug in the provided function is that the values are being enclosed in double quotes unnecessarily, and the formatting of the command list is incorrect.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the double quotes when appending the values to the command list and update the formatting of the command list.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append("{0}={1}".format(prop, val))
    return command
```

This corrected code satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided for both Case 1 and Case 2.
