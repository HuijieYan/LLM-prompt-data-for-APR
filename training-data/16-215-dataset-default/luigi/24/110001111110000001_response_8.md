The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is likely caused by the use of double quotes around the value in the command list when building the command. This is indicated by the AssertionError in the failing test, where the expected command list contains values without double quotes, but the actual command list contains values with double quotes.

To fix this bug, we should remove the double quotes when appending the values to the command list if the value is a string. 

Here is the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            if isinstance(val, str):
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
            else:
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, str(val))]
    return command
```

This modification ensures that the values are added to the command list without double quotes, which should resolve the failing test and pass the assertion.
