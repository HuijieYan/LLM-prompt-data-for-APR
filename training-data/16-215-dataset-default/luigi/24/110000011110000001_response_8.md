1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is designed to create a command from a dictionary of key-value pairs. The failing test function is attempting to use this function to compare the command generated with an expected command. The error message shows that there is an issue with the formatting of values in the generated command.

2. The potential error location within the `_dict_arg` function is the creation of the command list. It seems that the issue arises from the value formatting for the dictionary items.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a) Buggy function: The `_dict_arg` function is not formatting the values correctly, resulting in additional quotes being added to the command list.
   (b) Failing test and error message: The failing test is comparing the generated command with an expected command. The error message indicates that the formatting of certain values in the command list is incorrect, leading to a mismatch.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a) Ensure that the value formatting in the `_dict_arg` function is handled properly, without adding unnecessary quotes.
   (b) Update the function to handle value formatting for dictionary items more effectively.

5. Corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append('{0}={1}'.format(prop, val))
    return command
```
By modifying the `_dict_arg` function to directly append the name and formatted value to the `command` list without unnecessary quotes, the corrected code should pass the failing test.
