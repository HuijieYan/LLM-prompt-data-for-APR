The problem with the current implementation of the `_dict_arg` function is that it's not handling the case where the value in the dictionary is a string without quotes. The function is adding quotes around the entire key-value pair, but it should only add quotes if the value contains special characters.

The correct approach for fixing the bug is to check if the value contains special characters. If it does, then the function should add quotes around the key-value pair. Otherwise, it should just add the key-value pair without quotes.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            if any(c in val for c in [' ', '=', '"']):
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
            else:
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected implementation adds quotes around the key-value pair if the value contains special characters, and it adds the key-value pair without quotes if the value does not contain any special characters.

This corrected implementation should fix the bug and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. Now, the function should pass the failing tests.
