The problematic function is `_dict_arg` which is designed to take a dictionary and convert it into a list of command arguments. The issue arises when creating the command list by using list concatenation. This can lead to incorrect string formatting and handling, resulting in the failure of the tests.

To fix the bug, we need to use the `append` method to add elements to the list instead of using the `+=` operator for concatenation. This allows for proper formatting and handling of the command arguments.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append('"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val))
    return command
```

With this fix, the function will properly format the command arguments and address the issues identified in the failing tests.
