Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is at line 18 of the function `_dict_arg` where the value for the dictionary is not being appended correctly to the `command` list. 

Bug's Cause:
The cause of the bug is that the values from the dictionary are not being appended to the `command` list correctly. The failing test and error message indicate that the values are not being put in the correct format, leading to a mismatch in the expected and actual outputs.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Iterate over the dictionary and create a string in the format required to be appended to the command list.
2. Ensure proper formatting of the string when adding to the command list.

Corrected Code:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append("{0}={1}".format(prop, val))
    return command
```
