The problematic function `_dict_arg` is designed to take a dictionary of parameters and return a list of strings for a command. The issue is caused by the function adding quotation marks around the parameter values, which results in a mismatch with the expected format in the failing tests.

The function adds double quotation marks to the values of the dictionary elements, which results in the test cases failing as they expect the dictionary values in the command list to be without quotation marks.

The bug can be fixed by removing the quotation marks from around the property-value pairs in the command list generated by the `_dict_arg` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    # ... (other class code)

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Removing the quotation marks from property-value pairs
        return command
```

With this correction, the failing tests should pass because the values in the command list generated by the `_dict_arg` function will match the expected values, and there won't be any discrepancies related to the presence of extraneous quotation marks.
