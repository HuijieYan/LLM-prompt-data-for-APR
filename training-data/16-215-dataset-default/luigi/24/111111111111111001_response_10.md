The problem in the `_dict_arg` function is that it adds double quotes around the value of the dictionary items, which is unnecessary and causes the test to fail. The expected output does not include double quotes around the dictionary items.

Also noticed that the function is missing the requirement of self as the first parameter, making it a bound method of a class. This means, `luigi` has to be imported to make the code complete.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes from the command list that the function returns and add the `self` parameter as the first parameter of the function.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
import luigi

class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command.extend([name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)])
        return command
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
