The issue in the buggy function is that it is unnecessarily adding quotes around the value when constructing the command list. This is causing the assertion errors in the tests.

To fix the bug, the unnecessary quotes need to be removed from the constructed command list.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will construct the command list without adding unnecessary quotes, and it will satisfy the expected input/output variable information. The fixed function will now pass the failing tests.
