The bug in the _dict_arg function is that it is enclosing the property=value pair in double quotes, which is not expected in the expected results. This is causing the discrepancy between the expected and actual output. 

To fix this bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the property=value pair when appending it to the command list.

Here's the corrected code for the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function now properly constructs the command list without enclosing the property=value pair in double quotes, satisfying the expected input/output variable information provided.
