The problem is with the `_dict_arg` function in the `SparkSubmitTask` class. This function is expected to take a name and a dictionary as input, and return a list of command line arguments. 

The issue with the current implementation is that it wraps the values of the dictionary in double quotes. This causes problems when comparing the expected command with the actual command in the test cases.

The better approach would be to remove the double quotes from the values of the dictionary when constructing the command list.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed the double quotes around {1}
    return command
```

With this change, the function will construct the command list without wrapping the values of the dictionary in double quotes. This should address the issues observed in the failing test cases.
