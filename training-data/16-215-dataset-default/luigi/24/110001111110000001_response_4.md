The problem in the _dict_arg function is that it generates a command list where the values of the dictionary are enclosed in double quotes. However, in the failing test, the expected command list does not have the dictionary values enclosed in double quotes. This causes the assertion to fail.

To fix the bug, the _dict_arg function should be modified to generate a command list where the values of the dictionary are not enclosed in double quotes.

Here's the corrected code for the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this modification, the failing test should pass successfully.
