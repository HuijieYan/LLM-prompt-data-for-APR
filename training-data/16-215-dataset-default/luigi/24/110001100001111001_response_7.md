Potential error location: In the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`, the values for `name` and `value` are being added as separate elements to the `command` list, which is not the expected behavior.

Bug's cause:
The bug is caused by adding `name` and the formatted string `"{0}={1}"` as separate elements to the `command` list, resulting in an incorrect output.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Concatenate `name` and the formatted string `"{0}={1}"` before adding it to the `command` list.
2. Check for any other potential naming conflicts with the variables in the buggy function.

Corrected code:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name + ' "{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val))
    return command
```
