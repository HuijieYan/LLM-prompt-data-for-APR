The issue in the buggy function is that it is not properly formatting the command list for the dictionary input value. The function is attempting to add the key-value pairs to the command list, but it is not formatting the string correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to properly format the string and add it to the command list.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected code, the function will properly format the key-value pairs and add them to the command list. This will satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
