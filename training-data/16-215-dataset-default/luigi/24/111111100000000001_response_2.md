The potential error in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not constructing the command properly. When iterating through the dictionary items, it is using the same variable `value` for both the dictionary and the value of each key-value pair, which is causing the issue. 

To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable to store the value of each key-value pair in the dictionary. Additionally, we can simplify the logic by using list comprehension to construct the command.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            command += [f'{name} "{k}={v}"' for k, v in value.items()]
        return command
```

In the corrected version, we use list comprehension to iterate through the dictionary items and construct the command in a more concise way. We also use f-strings for better readability.
