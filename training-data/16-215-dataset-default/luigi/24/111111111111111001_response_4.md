The problem lies in the `_dict_arg` function where it is not correctly forming the command list when value is a dictionary. The function does not handle the formatting of the dictionary values properly, resulting in a mismatch between expected and actual values.

To address this bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to properly format the dictionary values into strings before adding them to the command list.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append('"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val))
    return command
```

By properly handling the dictionary values and appending them to the command list in the expected format, the corrected function should now pass the failing tests.
