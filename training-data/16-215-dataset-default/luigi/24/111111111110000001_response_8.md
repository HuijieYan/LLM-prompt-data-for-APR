The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to create a command for a Spark job from a dictionary of properties and values. The bug occurs when adding the property and value to the command list. The current implementation incorrectly adds the property and value in double quotes when appending to the list, causing assertion errors in the test cases.

The incorrect implementation is in the `for` loop inside the `_dict_arg` function where the property and value are added to the `command` list. The bug occurs when the value is added in quotes using the format method.

A possible approach to fixing the bug is to remove the quotes around the value when appending it to the command list. This should address the issue with the failing test cases.

Below is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the quotes around the value when adding it to the `command` list, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the assertion errors.
