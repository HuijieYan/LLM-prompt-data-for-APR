The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it is currently adding unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs when adding them to the `command` list. This is causing the test to fail when comparing the actual and expected values.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes when appending the key-value pairs to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Remove the unnecessary double quotes
    return command
```

By making this change, the function should now produce the expected output and pass the failing tests.
