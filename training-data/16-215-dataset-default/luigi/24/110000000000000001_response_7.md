1. The buggy function is supposed to take a dictionary 'value' and create a command based on the key-value pairs in the dictionary. However, there are some issues with the implementation.

2. The potential error location within the function is the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. Here, the use of square brackets is incorrect, and the format for adding the key-value pair to the 'command' list is also incorrect.

3. The cause of the bug is that the key-value pairs are not being added to the 'command' list correctly, and the formatting of the string is incorrect.

4. To fix the bug, we can use a different approach to construct the command list and format the key-value pairs correctly.

5. Here's the corrected code:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append('{0}="{1}={2}"'.format(name, prop, val))
    return command
```

In the corrected code, we iterate through the key-value pairs in the dictionary and construct the command list using the correct formatting. We use the `append` method to add formatted strings to the list.
