1. The buggy function is intended to take a name and a dictionary as input, and then create a command list based on the key-value pairs in the dictionary. However, there are several issues with the current implementation.

2. The potential error in the function lies in the line
   `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`
   where the string is formed incorrectly and the quotes are misplaced.

3. The cause of the bug is that the string formatting is not done correctly, and the quotes around the key-value pairs are not consistent, which leads to an incorrect command list being generated.

4. To fix the bug, we can:
   - Correct the string formatting to properly include the key-value pairs in the command list.
   - Remove unnecessary quotes and formatting around the key-value pairs.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
