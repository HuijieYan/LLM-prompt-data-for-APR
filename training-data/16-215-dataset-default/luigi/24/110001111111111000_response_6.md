The problem with the buggy function is that it is surrounding both the property and its value with double-quotes. This is incorrect and causing the failing tests.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected version, the function properly constructs the command list without double-quoting the property and its value.

This should address the failing tests and resolve the issue.
