The potential error location within the problematic function is the concatenation of the command and the format of the string in the list.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not adding the property-value pair in the correct format to the command list. It should be adding it as a single string with the format "prop=value", enclosed in double quotes.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to generate the correct string format for each property-value pair and append it to the command list.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append('{} "{}={}"'.format(name, prop, val))
    return command
```

This corrected function will now properly generate the command list with the expected format for each property-value pair, satisfying the provided expected input/output variable information.
