1. The buggy function takes in three parameters: self, name, and value. It checks if the value is a dictionary and then iterates through its items to create a command list.

2. The potential error location is within the loop that iterates through the dictionary items and concatenates the command list.

3. The bug's cause is that the function creates a new variable named "value" within the for loop, which causes the original value parameter to be overridden.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Renaming the 'value' variable within the for loop to avoid overriding the original value parameter.
   - Using a different approach to construct the command list.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append('{0}="{1}={2}"'.format(name, prop, val))
    return command
```
