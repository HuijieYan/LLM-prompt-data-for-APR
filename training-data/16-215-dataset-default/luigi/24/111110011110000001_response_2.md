The buggy function is `_dict_arg` within the `SparkSubmitTask` class which takes in `name` and `value` as input and returns a list `command` by adding elements based on the dictionary `value`. The errors in the function stem from improper handling of the dictionary values, leading to mismatched outputs with the expected results in the failing tests.

The potential error location is within the loop that iterates over the dictionary items and appends the key-value pairs to the `command` list.

The bug's cause lies in the incorrect formatting and handling of dictionary values, resulting in misaligned outputs.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Remove unnecessary quotation marks around dictionary items when adding them to the `command` list.
2. Utilize proper string formatting for dictionary key-value pairs to ensure consistency with the expected result.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Correctly format and add key-value pairs
    return command
```

With this correction, the `_dict_arg` function should now pass the failing tests.
