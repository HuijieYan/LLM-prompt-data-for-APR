1. The buggy function _dict_arg takes three arguments: self, name, and value. It checks if the value is a dictionary, and if so, it iterates over the items and appends them to the command list. The failing test provides examples of how the _dict_arg function is being used and the error messages indicate an issue with the format of the command list being returned by the function.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the formatting of the command when adding the key-value pairs from the dictionary to the command list.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is adding the key-value pairs to the command list in a format that doesn't match the expected format in the failing tests. The failing tests expect a specific format, but the _dict_arg function is not generating the command list in that format. This is resulting in an AssertionError.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could be to modify the way the command list is generated in the _dict_arg function so that it matches the expected format in the failing tests. This might involve changing how the key-value pairs are formatted and added to the command list.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '--{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # modify the format of key-value pairs
    return command
```

By modifying the format of the key-value pairs when adding them to the command list, the corrected code should now generate the command list in the expected format, causing the failing tests to pass.
