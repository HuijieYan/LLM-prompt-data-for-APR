The issue with the given `_dict_arg` function is that it's not properly constructing the command list based on the input dictionary. It's not formatting the key-value pairs correctly and it's not handling the case when the value is not a dictionary.

The expected behavior of the function is to construct a list of command-line arguments in the form of `name="prop1=val1"`. However, the function is not handling the formatting of the key-value pairs correctly, and it's not wrapping the entire key-value pair in double quotes.

To fix the bug, you can modify the function as follows:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # removed double quotes
    elif value:  # handle the case if value is not a dictionary
        command += [name, value]  # simply add the name and value
    return command
```

With this modification, the function should now properly construct the command list based on the input dictionary. It will handle the formatting of key-value pairs correctly, and it will also handle the case when the value is not a dictionary.

This should fix the bug and make the function behave as expected.

The corrected function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided for the failing tests.
