1. The buggy function is a method within a class called SparkSubmitTask. It seems to be designed to construct a command for submitting a Spark job. The function takes a name and a value as input and constructs a command based on the value.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the for loop that iterates over the key-value pairs of the input dictionary 'value'.

3. (a) The buggy function iterates over the key-value pairs of the input dictionary and constructs a command by concatenating the name and key-value pair enclosed in double quotes. However, the use of double quotes around the key-value pair seems unnecessary and could lead to issues when constructing the command.
   (b) The problem with the function is that it incorrectly constructs the command by adding unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pair, which could result in an incorrectly formatted command.

4. To fix the bug, we can remove the unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pair when constructing the command.

5. Corrected code:
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos, or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():  # Change the variable name 'value' to 'val' to avoid conflict
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Remove unnecessary double quotes
        return command
```
