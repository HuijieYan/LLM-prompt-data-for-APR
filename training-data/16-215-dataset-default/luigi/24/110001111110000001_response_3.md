The buggy function `_dict_arg` is designed to take a name and value and convert it into a list of strings. When value is a dictionary, it iterates over the items and creates a list of strings in the format "name=prop". However, the bug is that it's adding double quotes around the value, but the test code is not expecting those quotes, leading to a mismatch and assertion error.

To fix this, the _dict_arg function should create the strings without the double quotes around the value.

Updated function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This should resolve the issue and make the function return correctly formatted strings that align with the expectations of the test cases.
