The potential error location within the `_dict_arg` function is in the `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]` line. The issue seems to be caused by redundant double quotation marks in the list command.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the redundant double quotation marks and convert `'{0}={1}'` to `{0}={1}`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]
    return command
```
