The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not properly creating the command list when the `value` parameter is a dictionary. The current implementation is enclosing the dictionary key-value pair with double quotes, which is not necessary and causing the assertion errors in the test cases. Additionally, the function is using the `value` parameter as a loop variable, which overwrites the input parameter.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the implementation of the `_dict_arg` function to correctly construct the command list without unnecessary double quotes and use a different variable name for the loop variable to avoid overwriting the input parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected implementation, the function should now produce the expected command list without unnecessary double quotes, and it should pass the failing test cases provided.
