The problematic function "_dict_arg" takes in three input parameters - self, name, and value. It checks if the value is a non-empty dictionary and then iterates over its items to construct a command.

The bug in the function is the unnecessary use of double quotes around the "prop=value" pairs in the command list.

The failing tests are failing because the actual output includes the prop=value pairs in double quotes, whereas the expected output does not have them in double quotes.

To fix the bug, we should remove the unnecessary double quotes around the "prop=value" pairs.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected code will pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
