The issue comes from _dict_arg function that handles the command. Specifically, the function was converting all value-properties pairs to strings when they should have been left as it is. Below is the fixed version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
# The fixed version of the buggy function
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """
    
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():  # corrected conflicting name, value variables with prop, val
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # removed quotes around {0}={1}
        return command
```

With the above changes, the quotes around "{0}={1}" were removed and the conflicting variable names were fixed.

This corrected version should fix the AssertionError caused by the failing test.
