The potential error location within the problematic function is with the command list concatenation. The function is incorrectly adding quotes around the key-value pairs in the command list.

The bug's cause is that the function is not formatting the key-value pairs properly when adding them to the command list.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to properly format the key-value pairs without adding extra quotes. 

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    # the corrected function
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

With this correction, the function should produce the expected output for the given test cases.
