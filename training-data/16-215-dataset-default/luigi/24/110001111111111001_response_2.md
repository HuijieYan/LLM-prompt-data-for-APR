The problem with the buggy function `_dict_arg` is that the values are being wrapped in double quotes, which is not required. This is causing the test cases to fail.

To fix this issue, we can remove the double quotes from around the `prop=value` pairs when adding them to the `command` list.

Here is the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This code will now correctly format the values without adding unnecessary quotes, which will resolve the failing test cases and meet the expected input/output variable information.
