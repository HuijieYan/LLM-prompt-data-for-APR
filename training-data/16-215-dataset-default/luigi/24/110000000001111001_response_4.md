The bug in the function is caused by adding the name and value pairs to the command list in the wrong format. The current format is not consistent with the expected output.

To fix this bug, we need to change the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]` to `command.append(name + '=' + '"' + prop + '=' + value + '"')`.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name + '=' + '"' + prop + '=' + val + '"')
    return command
```
