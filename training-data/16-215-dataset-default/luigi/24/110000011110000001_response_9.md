The problem with the buggy function is that it is creating a list of command arguments for a subprocess, and when handling a dictionary value, it is wrapping the value in double quotes, which is causing the test to fail due to the difference in formatting. 

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the values in the command list when the value is a dictionary. 

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # change the variable name from value to val to avoid conflict
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # remove double quotes around {1}
    return command
```

With this change, the function should now correctly handle dictionary values and generate the command list without formatting issues. This corrected code will pass the failing test and the subsequent error message should be resolved.
