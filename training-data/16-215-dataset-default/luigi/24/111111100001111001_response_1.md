The potential error in the buggy function is the use of double quotes around the property-value pairs, which is not required. This causes the returned command list to have unnecessary double quotes.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes from the property-value pairs being added to the command list.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
