The potential error in the buggy function is the way the command list is being constructed. It is not properly enclosing the property-value pairs in double quotes when adding them to the command list.

The cause of the bug is that the command list is not being constructed with the correct format for the property-value pairs.

To fix the bug, we need to update the code to properly format the property-value pairs and enclose them in double quotes before adding them to the command list.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected code, the function should now produce the expected output for the provided test cases.
