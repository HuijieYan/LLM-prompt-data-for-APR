The problem with the `_dict_arg` function is that it incorrectly creates the command list. It is using double quotes around the property and value, which is causing the test cases to fail. Also, the name parameter is not being added to the command list.

To fix this, the function should be modified to add the property and value directly without using double quotes. Also, the name parameter should be added to the command list.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will correctly construct the command list without using unnecessary double quotes. It should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information and pass the failing test cases.
