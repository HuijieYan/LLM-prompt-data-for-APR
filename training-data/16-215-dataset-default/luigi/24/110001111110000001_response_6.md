The error in the `test_run` function occurs due to the `self.assertEqual` statement in the test case. When comparing the expected list and the actual list, there is a mismatch in the `--conf` argument. The expected list contains `'"Prop=Value"'` while the actual list contains `'Prop=Value'`. This suggests that the `_dict_arg` function is causing the issue by incorrectly formatting the `--conf` argument.

The `_dict_arg` function is used to construct a command list based on the provided name and value. The problem lies in how the function constructs the command list when processing the `value` parameter, which is expected to be a dictionary.

To fix the bug, the `_dict_arg` function should properly format the command list by handling dictionary values for the `--conf` argument.

One approach to fixing the bug is to check if the `name` is equal to 'conf'. If it is, then the function should append the key and value to the `command` list without wrapping the value in double quotes.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            if name == 'conf':
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
            else:
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this modification, the function should properly format the command list, and the failing test should pass.
