The problem is that the `_dict_arg` function is incorrectly formatting the dictionary values with quotes, causing the test to fail.

The bug is caused by the code `'"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)` inside the for loop which adds unnecessary double quotes to the values in the command list. This formatting is causing the test to fail because the expected command list does not contain the values with double quotes.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes formatting from the values in the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # remove unnecessary quotes
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will correctly format the dictionary values without adding double quotes, and it will pass the failing test.
