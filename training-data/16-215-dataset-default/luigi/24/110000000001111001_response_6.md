The issue with the buggy function is that it is not properly formatting the command by adding the quotes around the key-value pairs within the dictionary. This is causing the command list to be incorrectly formatted.

To fix the bug, we need to update the way the `command` list is populated. We will concatenate the `name` and the formatted key-value pair using f-strings, keeping the quotes around the pair, and then append it to the `command` list.

Here is the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(f'{name} "{prop}={val}"')
    return command
```

This function will now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
