1. The _dict_arg function takes three arguments: self, name, and value. It checks if the value is a dictionary and then iterates through its items to build a command list.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line "command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]". Here, the use of the same variable "value" for the loop iteration and as an input argument could cause confusion and errors.

3. The cause of the bug is that the loop variable "value" is reusing the same name as the input argument "value" in the for loop. This causes the input argument "value" to be overwritten, leading to unexpected behavior.

4. To fix the bug, we can rename the loop variable from "value" to something else to avoid reusing the same variable name.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # rename the loop variable to "val"
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # use the renamed loop variable
    return command
```
