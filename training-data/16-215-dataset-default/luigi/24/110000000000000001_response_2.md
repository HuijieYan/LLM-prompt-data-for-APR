1. The buggy function takes in three arguments: self, name, and value. It checks if the value is a dictionary and then iterates through its items to create a command list.

2. The potential error location is in the line:
   `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`
   Here, the use of double quotes around the {0}={1} may cause issues with the command generation.

3. The bug's cause is that the formatting of the command list is not correct and may lead to errors in the generated command.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Remove the double quotes around {0}={1} in the command formatting.
   b. Use a different method to generate the command list.

5. Corrected code:
```python
# corrected function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
