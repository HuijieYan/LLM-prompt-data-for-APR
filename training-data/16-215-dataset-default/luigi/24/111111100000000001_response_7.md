The buggy function is "_dict_arg" within the class SparkSubmitTask. This function is intended to build a command for submitting a Spark job based on the input name and value, where value is a dictionary. The potential error lies in the use of the variable name "value" in the for loop, which overwrites the input parameter "value".

The bug's cause is that the variable "value" used in the for loop to iterate through the dictionary items is the same name as the input parameter "value". This causes the input "value" to be overwritten, leading to unexpected behavior.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
- Renaming the variable in the for loop to something different, to avoid overwriting the input parameter.
- Using a separate variable for the iteration in the for loop.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():  # using a different variable name to avoid overwriting the input parameter
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # using the new variable for building the command
        return command
```
