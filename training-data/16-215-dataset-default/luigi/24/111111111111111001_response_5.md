The issue in the _dict_arg function is that it is using quotation marks for the values that should not be enclosed within quotes. This is causing the tests to fail. The expected result is to have a command list without quotes for the property and the value in the --conf flag.

To fix the bug, the _dict_arg function should be modified to remove the quotes around the property and value in the --conf flag.

Here's the corrected code for the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

The change made is to use the format '{0}={1}' without surrounding the values with quotes.

By making this change, the _dict_arg function will return the command list as expected and the failing tests should pass.
