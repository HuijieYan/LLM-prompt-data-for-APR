The buggy function `_dict_arg` takes two parameters, `name` and `value`, and constructs a command by iterating over the dictionary `value` and appending its key-value pairs to the command list.

The cause of the bug appears to be related to the construction of the command list in the `_dict_arg` function. The failing tests indicate that there is an issue with the formatting of the key-value pairs in the command list, resulting in a mismatch when comparing the expected command with the actual command.

To fix the bug, it seems that the function is adding unnecessary quotes around the value of each property of the command. It should simply add the property if its value is not an empty string. 

Here's the corrected `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            if val: # Check if the value is not empty
                command.append(name)
                command.append("{0}={1}".format(prop, val))
    return command
```

With this correction, the quotes around the values will not be added unnecessarily, and the function will only construct the command list when the key-value pair has a non-empty value.

This should resolve the issue and pass the failing tests.
