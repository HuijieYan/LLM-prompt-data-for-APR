The issue with the code is the unnecessary use of double quotes around the dictionary values when generating the `command` list. To fix the problem, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes from the resulting list.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This update removes the unnecessary double quotes around `prop` and `val` when constructing the `command` list, and it should fix the buggy function.
