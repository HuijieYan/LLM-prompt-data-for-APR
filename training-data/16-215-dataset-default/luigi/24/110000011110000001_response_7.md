The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to take in three parameters, self, name, and value, and return a command based on the values provided. The function is supposed to iterate through the dictionary items, create a command, and return it. However, there are a couple of issues in the function that are causing the failing tests.

The first issue is the use of `'"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)` which is causing the values to be enclosed within double quotes. This is leading to a mismatch in the assertion statements from the failing test. The second issue is the use of `+=` to append elements to the command list.

To fix the bug, we can use a different approach to build the command list. We can use string concatenation to build the command and then split it into a list, instead of directly appending elements to the list command.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = ""
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += "{0}={1} ".format(prop, val)
    return command.split()
```

With this change, the failing test should pass.
