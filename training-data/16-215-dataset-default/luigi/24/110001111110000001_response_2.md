The problem with the `_dict_arg` function is that when iterating through the items in the dict, it is adding double quotes around the prop=value pairs. This causes the test to fail because the expected list doesn't have the prop=value pairs enclosed in quotes.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the quotes when constructing the `command` list.

Here is the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this change, the function should now correctly construct the `command` list without adding extra quotes around the prop=value pairs, and both failing tests should now pass.
