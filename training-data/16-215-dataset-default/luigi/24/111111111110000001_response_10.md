The potential error location within the problematic function is the way that `prop` and `value` are being added to the `command` list. The format used to add the key-value pair is causing discrepancies in the expected and actual output of the function.

The bug is caused by the way the key-value pairs are added to the `command` list inside the `_dict_arg` function. The function is intended to iterate through the dictionary `value` and add each key-value pair to the `command` list in the format `name "prop=value"`. However, the current implementation is not consistent with this format, resulting in the test cases to fail with assertion errors.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to properly format the key-value pairs when adding them to the `command` list by removing the unnecessary quotes and formatting them as `name prop=value`. Additionally, it may be necessary to refactor the representation of the `command` list in order to match the expected output in the test cases.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making these changes, the function should properly format the key-value pairs and produce the expected output when used in the test cases.
