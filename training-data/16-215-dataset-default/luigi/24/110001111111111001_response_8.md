The issue in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the construction of the `command` list. The bug causes the values to be added without quotes.

The correct approach to fix the bug is to add a check for the data type of the value and add quotes accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            if isinstance(val, str):
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
            else:
                command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected code, the function should now correctly construct the `command` list, adding quotes around the values when necessary. This will ensure that the function passes the failing tests and satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided.
