The potential error in the `_dict_arg` function is that it overwrites the `value` parameter by using it as a loop variable, which leads to loss of the original `value` provided to the function. This is because the inner loop variable `value` is the same as the function parameter `value`.

To fix this bug, we need to use a different variable name for the inner loop.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Use a different variable name here
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
