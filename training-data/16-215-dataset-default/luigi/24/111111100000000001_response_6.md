1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is defined within the class `SparkSubmitTask` in the file `luigi/contrib/spark.py`. The function seems to be intended to take a dictionary of arguments and convert it into a list of command line arguments for a Spark job.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`, where the command list is being appended with the name and formatted property-value pair. 

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function is not handling the case when `value` is not a dictionary, which could result in unexpected behavior.
   (b). The class `SparkSubmitTask` does not specify how the function is intended to be used or what the expected input is.
   (c). The related function `name` is not directly related to the buggy function, so it does not provide insights into the bug's cause.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Check if `value` is a dictionary before attempting to iterate through its items.
   (b). Specify the expected input for the `_dict_arg` function in the class documentation to provide guidance for users.

5. Corrected code:

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name from value to val to avoid conflict
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Changed value to val
        return command
```

In the corrected code, the function now checks if the `value` is a dictionary before iterating through its items. Additionally, the variable name within the loop has been changed to avoid conflict with the outer function parameter.
