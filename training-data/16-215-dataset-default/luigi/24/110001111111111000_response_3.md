The following bug fix for the `_dict_arg` function is based on the given failing test cases.

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Changed 'value' to 'val'
    return command
```

Changing the variable name `value` to `val` inside the for loop ensures that there is no conflict with the input parameter name `value`. This fix should resolve the stated failing test cases.
