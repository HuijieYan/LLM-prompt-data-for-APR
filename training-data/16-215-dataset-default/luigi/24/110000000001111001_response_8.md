The bug in the given function is that the values within the `command` list are not being properly formatted. The format `"prop=value"` is being enclosed within double quotes which is not necessary.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the format `"prop=value"`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append("{0}={1}".format(prop, val))
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now produce the expected output for the given test cases.
