1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to take a dictionary `value` and construct a list of command strings based on its key-value pairs. However, it seems that the variable `value` is being overwritten within the loop, which is likely causing the bug.

2. The potential error location is within the loop where `value` is being used both as the loop variable and as the value from the dictionary.

3. The cause of the bug is that the variable `value` is being overwritten within the for loop, which leads to unexpected behavior when constructing the command list. This is evident from the function and how it handles the dictionary items.

4. One possible approach for fixing the bug is to use a different variable name for the loop variable, other than `value`, so that it does not conflict with the dictionary value. Additionally, we can simplify the construction of the command string using f-strings to make it more readable.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Use a different variable name for the loop variable
            command.append(f'{name} "{prop}={val}"')  # Construct the command string using f-strings
    return command
```
