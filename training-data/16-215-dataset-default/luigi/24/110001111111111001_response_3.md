The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the fact that it is creating quotes around the property-value pairs, which is causing the failing tests. The expected output does not have quotes around the property-value pairs, so we need to remove the quotes from the code. Additionally, we should rename the variable `value` inside the for loop to avoid overwriting the function argument `value`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information and pass the failing tests.
