The issue with the buggy function is that the values are not being formatted correctly. The function is adding unnecessary quotes around the values in the command list. It also needs to separate the key-value pairs using an equals sign instead of a space.

To fix the bug, the function needs to remove the unnecessary quotes and format the key-value pairs correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected function should format the key-value pairs correctly and remove the unnecessary quotes, which should resolve the issues and allow the function to pass the failing tests.
