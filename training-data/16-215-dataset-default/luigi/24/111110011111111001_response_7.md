The buggy function `_dict_arg` is meant to process a dictionary and format its key-value pairs into a list of command line arguments. However, the current implementation is incorrectly quoting the key-value pairs and is also adding double quotes to the value of the key-value pairs.

The error originates from the function `_dict_arg` due to the incorrect formatting and quoting of the command line arguments, causing the failing tests.

To fix the bug, the function `_dict_arg` should correctly format and quote the key-value pairs without adding additional double quotes to the value.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    # ... (other methods)

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

With this corrected function, the tests should now pass, and the expected input/output variable information also matches.
