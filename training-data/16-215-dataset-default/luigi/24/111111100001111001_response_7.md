The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not correctly formatting the dictionary values into the command list. The current implementation is not adding quotes around the property and value pairs, and is also not adding the equal sign between the property and value.

To fix the bug, we need to add the quotes and equal sign where necessary in the command list.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append('"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val))
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will now correctly format the dictionary values into the command list, including adding quotes and the equal sign between the property and value.

This corrected code satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided for both cases.
