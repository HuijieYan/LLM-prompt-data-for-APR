1. The buggy function is a method within the class "SparkSubmitTask". It is intended to take a name and a dictionary of properties as input and convert it into a command list for further processing.

2. The potential error is in the line where the "command" list is being constructed inside the for loop.

3. The bug is caused by using the same variable name "value" for both the function input and the loop variable. This leads to the function input being overwritten by the loop variable, resulting in incorrect command construction.

4. One approach to fixing the bug is to use a different variable name for the loop variable. Another approach would be to use a list comprehension to construct the command list.

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```
