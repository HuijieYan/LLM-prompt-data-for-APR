The problem in the buggy function is that it is adding double quotes around the property=value pairs, which is not expected. The function is also not handling the input parameter correctly and is overwriting the `value` variable name.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes from the command list and use the name parameter to construct the command list properly.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will construct the command list without adding unnecessary double quotes, and it will use the `name` parameter to properly construct the command list.

This corrected code will satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided for both cases.
