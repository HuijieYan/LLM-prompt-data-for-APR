The buggy function in the SparkSubmitTask class is the `_dict_arg` function. The error occurs because of the incorrect formatting of the dictionary values when constructing the command list. The string values in the dictionary are wrapped with double quotes and this is causing the assertion errors in the test cases.

The cause of the bug is that when building the command list, the function adds double quotes to the dictionary values, which is unnecessary and causes the test assertions to fail.

To fix this bug, the incorrect formatting of dictionary values should be removed.

The corrected code for the problematic function should be as follows:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # changed value to val to avoid overwriting the outer value
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # removed unnecessary double quotes
    return command
```
