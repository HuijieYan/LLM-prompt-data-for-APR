The `SparkSubmitTask` class is a Luigi task for running Spark jobs, and it contains a `_dict_arg` method, which is what we need to fix.

The failing test cases use the `SparkSubmitTask` class and run some test jobs, but they fail with assertions errors because the arguments passed to the process are not as expected. The failing tests and error messages indicate that the generated command list is not correct due to problems with dictionary arguments.

In the `_dict_arg` method, the issue is with the construction of the command list. The code should iterate through the dictionary and create elements in the command list based on the key-value pairs, but the implementation is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to change how the command list is built inside the `_dict_arg` method. We need to iterate through the dictionary, and for each key-value pair, construct the command elements properly without adding unnecessary quotes or formatting that is causing the problem in the tests.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` method:

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    # ... other class methods ...

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

With this correction, the `_dict_arg` method should now correctly build the command list for dictionary arguments and pass the failing test cases.
