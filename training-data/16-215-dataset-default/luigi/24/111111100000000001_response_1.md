The potential error in the buggy function `_dict_arg` is that the `command` list is being appended with the name and value, but the formatting is not correct. The `value` is being enclosed in double quotes which may not be necessary, and the format should be `prop=value` instead of `prop="value"`.

To fix the bug, we can modify the formatting of the command to the correct format and remove unnecessary double quotes.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

In the corrected code, we have removed the unnecessary double quotes around the `{0}={1}` format and modified the value variable to val to avoid conflict with the function parameter name. Now, the command list will be populated with the correct format of `prop=value`.
