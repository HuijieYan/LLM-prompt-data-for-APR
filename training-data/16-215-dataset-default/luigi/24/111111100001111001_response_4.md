The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not correctly formatting the dictionary items into key-value pairs. The function is currently adding double quotes around the entire key-value pair, when it should only add double quotes around the value.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to correctly format the key-value pairs.

Here is the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this change, the function should now correctly format the dictionary items into key-value pairs and return the expected output for both input cases.
