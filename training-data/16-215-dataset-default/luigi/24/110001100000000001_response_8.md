1. The buggy function _dict_arg takes a name and a dictionary value as input and constructs a command list based on the key-value pairs in the dictionary.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line where the command list is being constructed: command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]. It seems like this line is not adding the key-value pairs to the command list in the correct format.

3. The bug is likely caused by the use of the variable name in the for loop, which is shadowing the input parameter name. This causes the incorrect construction of the command list.

4. One possible approach for fixing the bug is to rename the loop variable in the for loop to avoid shadowing the input parameter name. Additionally, it may be necessary to modify the format string to properly construct the command list.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # renamed loop variable from value to val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # modified format string to use prop and val
    return command
```
