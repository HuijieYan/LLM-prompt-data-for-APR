Potential error location: The bug is likely in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]` where it is adding `name` and the formatted string `"{0}={1}"` to the command list.

Bug's cause: The bug occurs because the code is adding `name` and the formatted string to the command list as separate elements, instead of concatenating them into a single string.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Concatenate `name` and the formatted string using the `+` operator before adding them to the command list.
2. Use string formatting to create a single string that includes both `name` and the formatted string.

Corrected code:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [f'{name} "{prop}={val}"']
    return command
```
