The buggy function `_dict_arg` takes in three parameters: `self`, `name`, and `value`, and is expected to return a list of commands. The problem arises within the function when adding the `name` and `value` to the `command` list. 

The cause of the bug is due to the fact that `value` is being concatenated with the `command`, with the faulty format `"{0}={1}"`. This results in the elements being enclosed within double quotes, causing a mismatch with the expected result in the test.

To fix this bug, it's necessary to eliminate the double quotes when adding the name and value to the command list.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the `command` list will have elements without any double quotes, which should result in the correct behavior when compared with the expected result in the test.
