The issue with the buggy function is that it is appending the name and value in an incorrect format to the `command` list. It is using double quotes around the entire name=value pair, which is not necessary and causing the discrepancy between expected and actual output.

We can fix the bug by removing the unnecessary double quotes around the name=value pair in the `command` list.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command.append(name + '=' + prop + '=' + prop_value)
    return command
```

This corrected function satisfies both the expected input/output variable information provided.
