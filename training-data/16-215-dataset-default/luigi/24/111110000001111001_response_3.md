The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not properly formatting the command to include the property-value pairs from the input dictionary. The function should concatenate the name and formatted property-value pairs directly to the `command` list. Additionally, the use of double quotes around the property-value pairs is not necessary.

To fix the bug, we can update the function to properly format and append the property-value pairs to the command list without using unnecessary quotes.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected code, the function will properly format and construct the command list with property-value pairs without unnecessary quotes, satisfying the expected input/output variable information provided.
