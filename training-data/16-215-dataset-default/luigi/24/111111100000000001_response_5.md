1. The buggy function is a method within the SparkSubmitTask class in the luigi/contrib/spark.py file. It is meant to handle dictionary arguments and convert them into a list of command line arguments for a spark-submit job. The related function "name" is from the same file, but not the same class.

2. The potential error in the problematic function is the use of the name "value" as the loop variable in the for loop, which is the same as the function argument "value". This can cause confusion and potentially lead to unexpected behavior.

3. The bug is caused by the reassignment of the "value" variable within the for loop. This causes the original value passed to the function to be overwritten, and can result in unexpected behavior when processing the dictionary items.

4. To fix the bug, we can rename the loop variable in the for loop to something different from the function argument "value" to avoid shadowing the original value. Additionally, we can simplify the logic for building the command list.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():  # renamed loop variables
            command.append(name + '="' + str(key) + '=' + str(val) + '"')
    return command
```
