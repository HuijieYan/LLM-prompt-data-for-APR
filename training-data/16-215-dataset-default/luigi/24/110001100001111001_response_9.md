Potential error location: The bug is in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. Instead of adding the values as separate elements in the list, it should concatenate them into a single string.

Bug cause: The bug causes the command list to contain separate elements for name, property, and value, instead of a single string for each key-value pair.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Concatenate the name, property, and value into a single string before adding it to the command list.
2. Check if the input value is a dictionary and handle it accordingly.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append('{0}="{1}={2}"'.format(name, prop, val))
    return command
```
