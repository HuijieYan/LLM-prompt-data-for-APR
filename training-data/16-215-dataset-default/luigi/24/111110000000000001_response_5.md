1. The buggy function is part of the class SparkSubmitTask, which is a template task for running a Spark job. The function _dict_arg is intended to create a list of command line arguments based on a dictionary input.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the loop that iterates through the dictionary's key-value pairs.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is using the same variable name "value" for both the input parameter and the loop variable. This is causing the loop variable to overwrite the input parameter, leading to incorrect results when constructing the command list.

4. To fix the bug, the loop variable name should be changed to something other than "value" to avoid overwriting the input parameter. Additionally, the function should be modified to handle the case where the input value is not a dictionary.

5. Corrected code:
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
        else:
            command = [name, str(value)]
        return command
```
