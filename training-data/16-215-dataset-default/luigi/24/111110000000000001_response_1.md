1. The function _dict_arg is a method of the SparkSubmitTask class. It takes two parameters, name and value, and is used to construct a command for submitting a Spark job.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line "command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]". This line is attempting to concatenate the name, property, and value into the command list.

3. (a). The buggy function is supposed to construct a command for submitting a Spark job by iterating over the key-value pairs in the input dictionary and adding them to the command list. However, the implementation has a bug where the name is not being properly concatenated with the property and value.
   (b). The buggy class is the SparkSubmitTask class, which contains the _dict_arg method. This class is meant to be a template task for running a Spark job.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Use a different method for constructing the command, such as string formatting.
   - Rename the variable 'value' in the for loop to avoid confusion with the function parameter 'value'.
   - Ensure that the command list is constructed correctly with the name, property, and value.

5. The corrected code:
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command.append('{} "{}={}"'.format(name, prop, val))
        return command
```

In the corrected code, the function has been updated to use string formatting to properly construct the command list with the name, property, and value. Additionally, the variable 'value' in the for loop has been renamed to 'val' to avoid confusion with the function parameter 'value'.
