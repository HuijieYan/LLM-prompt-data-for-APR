1. The buggy function is `request_body_to_args` which is intended to convert the request body to function arguments. The failing test functions `test_python_list_param_as_form`, `test_python_set_param_as_form`, and `test_python_tuple_param_as_form` are testing the functionality of the `request_body_to_args` function. The error message is showing that the response status code is 422 instead of the expected 200, indicating that the request is failing. The GitHub issue is related to supporting repeated key=value pairs in form data. This suggests that the issue might be related to handling repeated keys in the form data.

2. The potential error location within the `request_body_to_args` function could be in the section where it handles the form data and attempts to process repeated keys.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The `request_body_to_args` function fails to handle repeated keys in the form data properly, which leads to incorrect processing of the form data.
   (b). The related functions do not efficiently handle the conversion of form data into function arguments, especially when dealing with repeated keys.
   (c). The failing test and error message show that the response status code is not as expected, indicating that the form data processing is not working correctly.
   (d). The GitHub Issue information confirms that the issue is related to handling repeated keys in form data.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the `request_body_to_args` function to correctly handle repeated keys in form data and process them as expected.
   - Update the related functions to ensure they handle form data, including repeated keys, efficiently.
   - Handle the form data processing in a way that aligns with the expectations outlined in the GitHub issue.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict, Any, Optional, Union
from pydantic.fields import ModelField
from fastapi import Form, UploadFile, FastAPI, Request
from copy import deepcopy

async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                if value is not None:
                    if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                        received_body, FormData
                    ):
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    else:
                        value = [value] if not isinstance(value, list) else value
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and not value)
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and not value
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.alias] = deepcopy(field.default)
                    continue
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.alias] = v_
    return values, errors
```

This corrected code ensures that the `request_body_to_args` function correctly handles repeated keys in form data and processes them as lists, meeting the expectations outlined in the GitHub issue. It should also pass the failing tests, resolving the issue with form data processing.
