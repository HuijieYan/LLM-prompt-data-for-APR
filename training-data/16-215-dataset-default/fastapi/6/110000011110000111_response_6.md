The problem with the buggy function `request_body_to_args` seems to be related to the handling of form data with multiple values for the same key, and the function's inability to handle non-typing sequences such as lists and sets properly.

The failing test functions `test_python_list_param_as_form`, `test_python_set_param_as_form`, and `test_python_tuple_param_as_form` are failing because the response status code is not as expected (422 instead of 200), indicating that there is an issue with the validation of form data containing non-typing sequences.

The GitHub issue "Support repeated key=value in form data" also points to a similar problem where FastAPI should collect repeated keys in the 2-tuple list that request.form() gives and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation happens.

It seems that the potential error location within the `request_body_to_args` function lies in the handling of repeated keys in form data, and the validation of non-typing sequences.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to update the function to properly handle repeated keys in form data and correctly validate non-typing sequences such as lists and sets.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_body_to_args` function with the necessary fixes:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        field_info = get_field_info(field)
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                if field.alias in received_body:
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = []
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        if value is None and field.required:
            errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
        elif value is None and not field.required:
            values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

With these corrections, the `request_body_to_args` function should now properly handle repeated keys in form data and validate non-typing sequences, and should pass the failing test cases. Additionally, the GitHub issue about supporting repeated key=value in form data should also be addressed with these changes.
