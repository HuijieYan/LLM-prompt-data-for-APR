The bug in the function is related to handling repeated keys in form data. It currently only captures the last key=value pair, while it should be collecting repeated keys and assigning those values as a list to the same key before validation happens.

The potential error location within the function is where it checks for the `field.shape` in `sequence_shapes` and then assigns the value to `received_body.getlist(field.alias)` or `received_body.get(field.alias)`. This is where the function fails to handle repeated keys in form data correctly.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling repeated keys in form data. It's only capturing the last key=value pair, instead of collecting repeated keys and assigning those values as a list to the same key before validation.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles repeated keys in form data and assigns those values as a list to the same key before validation happens.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        field = required_params[0]
        field_info = get_field_info(field)
        embed = getattr(field_info, "embed", None)
        if len(required_params) == 1 and not embed and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
            received_body = dict(received_body)
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                if value is not None and field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                    value = value if isinstance(value, list) else [value]
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

With this corrected code, the function should now correctly handle repeated keys in form data and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation happens. This will address the issue reported in the GitHub description and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
