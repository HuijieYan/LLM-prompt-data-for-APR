The issue in the buggy function lies in the conditional statement that checks for sequence shapes and the type of received body. The function currently does not handle the case of multiple values for the same key in the FormData. It also fails to properly handle different sequence shapes such as list, set, and tuple.

The failing test cases are due to the fact that the function is not correctly handling multiple values for the same key in the FormData.

The GitHub issue also highlights this problem where FastAPI should collect repeated keys in the 2-tuple list that request.form() gives and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation happens.

To fix this bug, the function needs to be updated to properly handle the scenario where the same key appears multiple times in the FormData. Additionally, it should handle different sequence shapes such as list, set, and tuple appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Tuple, Optional, Union
from pydantic import FormData, BaseModel, create_model, Field
from fastapi import FastAPI, Form
from fastapi import Body
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient

# Corrected function
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        field = required_params[0]
        field_info = get_field_info(field)
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    if field.alias in received_body:
                        if field.shape == 1:
                            value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                        else:
                            value = getattr(received_body, field.alias)
                    else:
                        value = None
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected code, we've added a check to handle the scenario where the same key appears multiple times in the FormData. We also handled different sequence shapes such as list, set, and tuple appropriately. This should resolve the failing test cases and address the issue raised in the GitHub post.
