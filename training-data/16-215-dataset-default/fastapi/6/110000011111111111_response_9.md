The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function is related to handling repeated keys in form data. It currently only processes the last key=value pair, but it should collect and assign all values to the same key before validation.

The failing test for this function is related to passing a list, set, or tuple as form data to FastAPI. The form data contains repeated keys, but the function does not handle these cases correctly, leading to a 422 error status code instead of the expected 200 status code.

The GitHub issue posted for this bug suggests that FastAPI should collect repeated keys in the 2-tuple list that `request.form()` gives and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation happens.

To fix the bug, the `request_body_to_args` function needs to be modified to handle repeated keys and assign their values as a list, set, or tuple before validation.

Below is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
from typing import Dict, Any, List, Tuple, Union, Optional
from pydantic import FormData
from fastapi.encoders import jsonable_encoder
from fastapi.datastructures import UploadFile
from copy import deepcopy
import asyncio

async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    values[field.name] = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    continue
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version, the function iterates through all the required params and checks for repeated keys in the form data. It then assigns the values as a list to the same key before validation. This ensures that the function now handles repeated keys correctly and should pass the failing test cases.

This corrected function should satisfy the expected input/output variable information and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.

With this fix, FastAPI should now be able to support repeated keys in form data.
