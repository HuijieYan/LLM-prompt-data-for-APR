The issue in the provided function is that it does not handle sequence shapes correctly, leading to incorrect values and errors being returned. 

The bug seems to stem from the incorrect handling of the `sequence_shapes` condition in the code. The function is not correctly identifying the shape of the received field, and therefore not appropriately validating or converting the values.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to modify the logic for handling sequence shapes and retrieving values from the received body. Additionally, the function may need to be updated to better handle different field types and their associated conditions.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Optional, Union, Tuple, Type

async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    sequence_types = (list, set, tuple)  # added for determining sequence types
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            field_info = get_field_info(field)
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_types and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_types
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if field.shape in sequence_types:
                if field_info.type_ == list:
                    values[field.name] = list(value)
                elif field_info.type_ == set:
                    values[field.name] = set(value)
                elif field_info.type_ == tuple:
                    values[field.name] = tuple(value)
            else:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected code, the function first checks for the field shape and then retrieves the values accordingly. It correctly handles the sequence types (list, set, tuple) and validates the values based on the field type. This updated code should satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided.
