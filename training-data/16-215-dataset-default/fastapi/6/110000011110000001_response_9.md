The buggy function 'request_body_to_args' is responsible for converting the request body data into arguments. The failing tests indicate that the response status code should be 200, but it is instead 422. This means that the data is not being processed correctly in the function. The potential error location is likely in the section of the code where the 'value' is being assigned and validated based on the 'shape' and 'type' of the field.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly processing the input data when it contains Python list, set, or tuple parameters.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated to correctly handle different Python sequence types such as lists, sets, and tuples. This may involve modifying the way the input data is processed and validated based on the field type and shape.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                if field.type_ == list:
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                elif field.type_ == set:
                    value = set(received_body.getlist(field.alias))
                elif field.type_ == tuple:
                    value = tuple(received_body.getlist(field.alias))
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version of the function, it correctly handles different types of sequences such as lists, sets, and tuples when processing the received body. This should allow the function to correctly process the input data and pass the failing tests.
