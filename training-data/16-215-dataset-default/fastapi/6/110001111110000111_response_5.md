1. The buggy function "request_body_to_args" is intended to convert a request body into a dictionary of values and a list of errors. It is used to process form data in FastAPI. The failing test functions are testing various scenarios where form data is being processed, and they are all failing with a status code of 422 instead of the expected 200. The GitHub issue is related to parsing repeated key=value pairs in form data.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely related to how the function handles repeated keys in form data.

3. The cause of the bug is likely related to the function not properly handling repeated keys in form data. The failing test functions are supplying form data with repeated keys, but the function is not correctly processing them into a list of values. The GitHub issue further supports this by pointing out the issue with parsing repeated key=value pairs in form data.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include modifying the function to properly handle repeated keys in form data and ensure that they are processed into a list of values. This may involve modifying the logic for extracting values from the form data and handling repeated keys specifically.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Optional, Union, Tuple
from fastapi.params import params, File, Form
from fastapi.concurrency import async_generator
from fastapi.datastructures import Default
from fastapi.dependencies.utils import sequence_shape_to_type, sequence_shapes, get_field_info, lenient_issubclass
from fastapi.openapi.models import ModelField
from fastapi.utils import PYDANTIC_1
from fastapi import UploadFile
from copy import deepcopy
from pydantic.error_wrappers import ErrorWrapper
from pydantic.errors import MissingError
from pydantic.fields import ModelField
from pydantic import BaseModel


async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                if value is None and field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                elif value is not None:
                    if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                        value = await value.read()
                    elif field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                        awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                        contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                        value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                    v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                    if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                        errors.append(errors_)
                    elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                        errors.extend(errors_)
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected code, the if-else logic for handling repeated keys in form data has been modified to properly extract the values and handle them as lists when necessary. This correction addresses the issue discussed in the failing tests and should resolve the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
