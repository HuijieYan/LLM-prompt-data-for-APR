1. The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting request body data into arguments. It seems to be specifically designed for handling request form data. The failing test functions are attempting to test the function's ability to handle Python list, set, and tuple parameters as form data. However, the tests are failing with a 422 status code instead of the expected 200.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the logic that handles the conversion of form data to arguments, particularly when dealing with sequence types such as lists, sets, and tuples.

3. The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of repeated keys in the form data. The failing tests are providing repeated keys in the form data, but the function is not correctly converting these into the expected results. The GitHub issue details a similar problem and suggests that FastAPI should collect repeated keys and assign the values to a list before validation.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Modify the logic in the `request_body_to_args` function to correctly handle repeated keys in form data and convert them into the expected data structure for validation.
   (b). Ensure that the function can handle Python list, set, and tuple parameters as form data and validate them accurately.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Optional, Union, Tuple
from fastapi import UploadFile, Form
from pydantic import BaseModel, BaseConfig, create_model

class ModelField:
    # Define the ModelField class

class ErrorWrapper:
    # Define the ErrorWrapper class

def get_field_info(field):
    # Define the get_field_info function

def lenient_issubclass(a, b):
    # Define the lenient_issubclass function

async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if (
                    field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and isinstance(received_body, FormData)
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                if value is not None:
                    if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                        value = await value.read()
                    v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                    if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                        errors.append(errors_)
                    elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                        errors.extend(errors_)
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = v_
                else:
                    if field.required:
                        if PYDANTIC_1:
                            errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                        else:
                            errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig))
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
    return values, errors
```

The corrected code involves simplifying the logic for handling form data, particularly with sequence types. It ensures that the function handles repeated keys and assigns the values to a list before validation. This version of the function should address the issues raised in the failing tests and the GitHub issue.
