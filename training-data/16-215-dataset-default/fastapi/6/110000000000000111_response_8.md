1. The buggy function "request_body_to_args" is used to extract and validate data from a request body. The GitHub issue is related to a problem where repeated key=value pairs in form data are not handled correctly. The issue suggests that FastAPI should collect repeated keys and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation happens.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the section that handles the retrieval of values from the request body and the validation of those values. Specifically, the issue with handling repeated keys in form data could be related to how the function processes the received_body data.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle repeated keys in form data. When multiple key=value pairs with the same key are present in the form data, only the last key=value pair is being processed, resulting in incorrect validation.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Modifying the function to collect and process all key=value pairs with the same key as a list before validation.
   - Adding logic to handle repeated keys in form data and ensure that all values are processed correctly during validation.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function that includes handling repeated keys in form data:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    def get_field_value(field: ModelField, received_body: Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]):
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                return received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                return received_body.get(field.alias)
        return None

    values = {}
    errors = []

    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value = get_field_value(field, received_body)

            if value is None or (isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.Form) and value == "") or (
                    isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.Form) and field.shape in sequence_shapes and len(value) == 0):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                    else:
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                    if not isinstance(value, list):
                        value = [value]
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

In the corrected code, a new function "get_field_value" is introduced to handle retrieving values from the request body. This function is used to properly handle repeated keys in form data and ensure that all values are processed correctly during validation.
