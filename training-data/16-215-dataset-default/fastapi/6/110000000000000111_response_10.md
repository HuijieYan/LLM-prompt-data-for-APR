1. The problematic function `request_body_to_args` is related to the GitHub issue as it is responsible for processing the received form data and mapping it to the required parameters. The GitHub issue discusses the problem of not being able to support repeated key=value pairs in form data and suggests a solution where FastAPI should collect repeated keys and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation happens.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is at the section where it processes the form data and assigns values to the keys. Specifically, the handling of repeated keys in form data is likely the cause of the issue.

3. The bug in the function is caused by the fact that it does not handle repeated key=value pairs in form data correctly, resulting in only the last key=value winning. This issue is in line with the GitHub issue, which mentions that FastAPI should collect repeated keys and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation happens. This means that the current implementation of the function does not support the desired behavior for repeated keys in form data.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Modifying the logic for processing form data to correctly handle repeated key=value pairs and assign those values as a list to the same key.
   - Checking for the presence of repeated keys in form data and updating the logic to handle them appropriately.

5.  Corrected code:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                        received_body, FormData):
                    if isinstance(received_body[field.alias], list):
                        value = received_body[field.alias]
                    else:
                        value = [received_body[field.alias]]
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)

            if value is None:
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue

            if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                value = await value.read()

            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

This corrected code addresses the issue by specifically checking for repeated keys in the form data and handling them accordingly. It now processes the form data to correctly assign values as a list to the same key. This updated logic aligns with the desired behavior mentioned in the GitHub issue.
