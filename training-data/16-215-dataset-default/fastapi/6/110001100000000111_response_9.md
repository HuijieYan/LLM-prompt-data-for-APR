1. The buggy function is a part of the FastAPI library, specifically in the "dependencies/utils.py" file. It seems to be a utility function that is used to convert the request body into arguments and also handle validation errors. The GitHub issue is related to supporting repeated key-value pairs in form data, which the function seems to be involved in handling.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be the handling of repeated keys in the form data, specifically where it checks for sequence_shapes and processes the received body.

3. The cause of the bug can be attributed to the function not properly handling repeated keys in form data, resulting in only the last key-value pair being used for validation. The GitHub issue also mentions that the expectation is for FastAPI to collect repeated keys and assign those values as a list before validation.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include modifying the function to properly handle repeated keys in form data, properly collecting multiple values for the same key before validation, and ensuring that the validation works as expected for repeated key-value pairs.

5. Corrected code:

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Union, Optional, Tuple
from fastapi import params, UploadFile
from pydantic.fields import ModelField
from pydantic.errors import ErrorWrapper, MissingError
from pydantic.typing import sequence_shapes, sequence_types, lenient_issubclass
from pydantic import BaseConfig
import asyncio
from copy import deepcopy

async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(value, list):
                    value = value
                elif field.shape in sequence_shapes and not isinstance(value, list):
                    value = [value]
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(field, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors

```

In the corrected code, the function has been modified to properly handle repeated keys in form data by checking if the value is a list and if not, converting it into a list. This ensures that all values for the same key are collected before validation. Additionally, the code has been updated to incorporate the suggestions from the GitHub issue, enabling the function to work as expected for repeated key-value pairs in form data.
