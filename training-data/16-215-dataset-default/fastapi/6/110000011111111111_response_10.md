The issue in the buggy function is that it does not handle repeated keys in form data properly, resulting in only the last key=value pair being considered. This causes the validation to fail when the expected value is a list or set.

The failing tests are checking for form data with repeated keys, and the error message indicates that the status code is 422 (validation error) when it should be 200 (success).

The GitHub issue also describes the same problem and suggests that FastAPI should collect repeated keys and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation happens.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle repeated keys in the form data and assign the values to a list in such cases, before the validation process.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Tuple, Optional, Union
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, ValidationError
from starlette.datastructures import FormData
from fastapi.param_functions import UploadFile
from fastapi.exceptions import HTTPException
from fastapi import FastAPI, Form, Request

class ModelField(BaseModel):
    name: str
    type: Any
    required: bool

class ErrorWrapper(BaseModel):
    exc: Any
    loc: Tuple[str, Any]

class CorrectedFieldInfo:
    def __init__(self, embed: bool):
        self.embed = embed

def get_field_info(field: ModelField) -> CorrectedFieldInfo:
    return CorrectedFieldInfo(embed=False)

def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value = received_body.getlist(field.name) if isinstance(received_body, FormData) else received_body.get(field.name)
        if value is None or value == []:
            if field.required:
                errors.append(
                    ErrorWrapper(
                        exc=ValidationError([{"loc": ["body", field.name], "msg": "field required", "type": "value_error.missing"}]),
                        loc=("body", field.name)
                    )
                )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            try:
                v_ = field.type_(value)
                values[field.name] = v_
            except ValidationError as e:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(exc=e, loc=("body", field.name)))

    return values, errors
```

The corrected function now properly handles repeated keys in the form data and assigns the values to a list before the validation process. This should resolve the bug and pass the failing tests.
