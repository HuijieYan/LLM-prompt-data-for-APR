1. The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is intended to convert request body data into arguments. It checks for required parameters and their values, and then validates and returns the values and any potential errors. The function deals with various field shapes and their corresponding data types, and it also handles Form data and FormData.

The related GitHub issue suggests that the current behavior of FastAPI in handling repeated keys in form data does not work as expected, and it proposes a solution to collect repeated keys and assign their values as a list before validation.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function might be in the handling of repeated keys in form data, specifically in how it collects and assigns those values as a list before validation.

3. The root cause of the bug can be attributed to the implementation of the function not properly handling repeated keys in form data as suggested in the GitHub issue.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could involve modifying the function to correctly handle and process repeated keys in form data. This could involve refactoring the logic for parsing and validating form data, and specifically addressing how repeated keys are collected and assigned as a list.

5. **Corrected code:**
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                    if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                        received_body, FormData
                    ):
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```
This corrected code involves minor modifications to the original function, specifically in handling repeated keys in form data. It aims to address the GitHub issue's suggestion by ensuring that repeated keys are correctly collected and assigned as a list before validation.
