The issue with the buggy function seems to be related to how it handles repeated keys in FormData. The function should be able to process repeated key-value pairs and assign them as a list for the same key before validation happens. This aligns with the GitHub issue description, which suggests that FastAPI should be able to collect repeated keys and assign those values as a list before validation.

The potential error in the function seems to be the logic for handling repeated keys in the FormData and how it validates and processes them. The current implementation does not handle repeated keys effectively and only considers the last key=value pair, leading to incorrect validation and data processing.

The bug's cause can be attributed to the function not correctly handling repeated keys in FormData and not assigning them as a list for the same key before validation.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to correctly handle repeated keys in FormData and assign their values as a list before validation. This will ensure that all values for a repeated key are captured and validated correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Tuple, Union, Optional, Type
from fastapi import UploadFile, Form, File, FormData
from pydantic import BaseModel, BaseConfig, validator, Field, Repetition, ValidationError, create_model
from copy import deepcopy

class ErrorWrapper:
    pass

class ModelField:
    pass

def get_field_info(field):
    pass

sequence_shapes = [1]
sequence_types = tuple, list, set

def lenient_issubclass(field_type, data_type):
    pass

class MissingError:
    pass

sequence_shape_to_type = {
    1: tuple,
}

def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        field = required_params[0]
        field_info = get_field_info(field)
        embed = getattr(field_info, "embed", None)
        if len(required_params) == 1 and not embed:
            received_body = {field.alias: received_body.getlist(field.alias)}
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In this corrected code, we handle repeated keys in FormData by using `received_body.getlist(field.alias)` to capture all values for a repeated key as a list. This ensures that all values are captured and validated correctly before processing. This approach aligns with the expectation from the GitHub issue and should resolve the bug in the function.
