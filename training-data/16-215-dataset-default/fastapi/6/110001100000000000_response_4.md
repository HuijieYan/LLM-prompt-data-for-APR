# The corrected and fixed version of the function

```
I made several changes to the function:

1. Changed the type of `required_params` from `ModelField` to `Field`.
2. Removed the usage of `get_field_info()` and other specific functions that were not provided in the snippet.
3. Removed the references to `FormData` and use them directly as `FormData`.
4. Replaced all `ErrorWrapper` with `ValidationError`.
5. Re-implemented the logic for checking the `required_params` and handling the values and errors accordingly.
6. Re-implemented the file handling logic for `UploadFile` and `Form` fields.

Note: The code references several dependencies and type definitions that are not provided in the snippet. This version of the function assumes the presence of these dependencies and type definitions for validation to work correctly.
