1. The problematic function `_clone_functional_model` is intended to clone a functional model instance, creating new layers and weights instead of sharing them with the original model. The failing test `test_clone_functional_model_with_multi_outputs` is invoking the `clone_model` function to clone a model and then making predictions with the original and cloned models. The error message indicates that it could not compute the output for the tensor `"swap_layer_1/Identity:0"`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the process of iterating over the nodes in the reference model and calling the layers on the input tensors to compute the output tensors.

3. The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of input tensors and the corresponding layers during the process of cloning the model. This results in an assertion error during the model output computation.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check the creation and mapping of input tensors and layers, ensuring that the mapping between original and cloned layers is accurate.
   - Verify the correct handling of input tensors and their corresponding layers during the iteration over the nodes in the reference model.
   - Ensure that the computed output tensors are being correctly updated in the `tensor_map` during the iteration process.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)

    layer_map = {}
    tensor_map = {}

    if input_tensors is None:
        input_tensors = [Input(batch_shape=layer.input.shape[1:], dtype=layer.input.dtype) for layer in model._input_layers]

    for i, layer in enumerate(model._input_layers):
        layer_map[layer] = input_tensors[i]

    for node in model._nodes_by_depth:
        inbound_layer = node.outbound_layer

        if inbound_layer not in layer_map:
            new_layer = inbound_layer.from_config(inbound_layer.get_config())
            layer_map[inbound_layer] = new_layer
        else:
            new_layer = layer_map[inbound_layer]
            if isinstance(new_layer, InputLayer):
                continue

        reference_input_tensors = node.input_tensors
        reference_output_tensors = node.output_tensors

        computed_data = [(tensor_map[x][0], tensor_map[x][1]) for x in reference_input_tensors if x in tensor_map]

        if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
            if node.arguments:
                kwargs = node.arguments
            else:
                kwargs = {}

            computed_tensors = [x[0] for x in computed_data]
            computed_masks = [x[1] for x in computed_data]

            output_tensors = to_list(new_layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs))

            if has_arg(new_layer.call, 'mask') and 'mask' not in kwargs:
                kwargs['mask'] = computed_masks

            output_masks = to_list(new_layer.compute_mask(computed_tensors, computed_masks))

            for x, y, mask in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors, output_masks):
                tensor_map[x] = (y, mask)

    output_tensors = [tensor_map[x][0] for x in model.outputs]

    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

With this corrected function, the failing test `test_clone_functional_model_with_multi_outputs` should pass without the previous assertion error.
