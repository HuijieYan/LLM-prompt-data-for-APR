The bug in the `_clone_functional_model` function is causing an assertion error because the function fails to compute the output tensors correctly and raise an assertion error if any of the output tensors are not computed.

The issue seems to stem from the computation of output tensors within the for loop that iterates over the nodes. The function is supposed to build a new model upon new input tensors using newly instantiated weights, but it fails to properly map the input and output tensors, resulting in uncomputed output tensors.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all node input tensors are available in the `tensor_map` before computing the output tensors for each node.

Here's the corrected code for the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)
    
    # mapping the input tensors
    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    # Iterate over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    depth_keys = list(model._nodes_by_depth.keys())
    depth_keys.sort(reverse=True)
    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # Recover the corresponding layer.
            layer = node.outbound_layer

            if all(x in tensor_map for x in node.input_tensors):
                # Get or create layer.
                if layer not in layer_map:
                    # Clone layer.
                    new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
                    layer_map[layer] = new_layer
                    layer = new_layer
                else:
                    # Reuse previously cloned layer.
                    layer = layer_map[layer]
                    # Don't call InputLayer multiple times.
                    if isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
                        continue

                # Gather inputs to call the new layer.
                reference_input_tensors = node.input_tensors
                reference_output_tensors = node.output_tensors

                # Call layer.
                computed_data = [tensor_map[x] for x in reference_input_tensors]
                if node.arguments:
                    kwargs = node.arguments
                else:
                    kwargs = {}
                output_tensors = to_list(layer(computed_data, **kwargs))
                output_masks = to_list(layer.compute_mask(computed_data, None))  # Assuming mask is not used

                # Update tensor_map.
                for x, y, mask in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors, output_masks):
                    tensor_map[x] = (y, mask)

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs,
    # then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = [tensor_map[x][0] for x in model.outputs]
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

The corrected function now properly checks if all previous input tensors are available in `tensor_map` before calling the new layer. It also correctly maps the output tensors to the `tensor_map` and uses the computed output tensors to instantiate a new model.

With these changes, the function should now pass the failing test and no longer raise an assertion error.
