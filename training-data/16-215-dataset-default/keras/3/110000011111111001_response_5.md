The cause of the bug is that the `input_layers` list is not correctly populated when `input_tensors` is None. This causes an issue when trying to create a new input layer.

Possible approaches to fix the bug:
1. Populate the `input_layers` list when `input_tensors` is None.
2. Ensure that the `input_layers` list is correctly matched to the `input_tensors`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    if input_tensors is None:
        # Create placeholders to build the model on top of.
        input_layers = []
        input_tensors = []
        for layer in model._input_layers:
            input_tensor = Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape,
                                 dtype=layer.dtype,
                                 sparse=layer.sparse,
                                 name=layer.name)
            input_layers.append(layer)  # Store the input layer
            input_tensors.append(input_tensor)
            # Cache newly created input layer.
            newly_created_input_layer = input_tensor._keras_history[0]
            layer_map[layer] = newly_created_input_layer

    # ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)

    for x, y in zip(input_layers, input_tensors):
        layer_map[x] = y  # Update layer map with input layers and tensors

    # ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)
```

With this correction, the `input_layers` list is correctly populated, ensuring that the input layers and tensors are matched, and the function should now pass the failing test.
