1. The buggy function "_clone_functional_model" is used for cloning a functional Keras model, but it has an issue when handling the output masks for layers that do not support masks, which causes the error "Could not compute output Tensor". The github issue also mentions a similar error related to output masks.

2. The potential error location within the function is when it tries to compute the output masks using the "layer.compute_mask" function. This function always returns None for layers that do not support masks, causing the output_masks to always be [None] instead of the expected [None, None].

3. (a) The buggy function is attempting to clone a functional Keras model by creating new layers and instantiating new weights instead of sharing the weights of existing layers. The function encounters the issue when trying to handle the output masks for layers that do not support masks.

   (b) The github issue information suggests that the error occurs when using a functional model with a layer that has more outputs without mask support, causing the output masks to always be [None], leading to the "Could not compute output Tensor" error.

4. Possible approach for fixing the bug:
   - Check if a layer supports masks before attempting to compute masks for its output. If the layer does not support masks, then set output_masks to None instead of calling layer.compute_mask.
   - Handle the case where the layer's output has multiple tensors and handle the masks for each output tensor accordingly.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from keras.models import Model, clone_model
from keras.layers import Input, Add, Lambda
from keras.utils import multi_gpu_model

def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # existing code here...

    # Iterated over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    # existing code here...

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs,
    # then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)
        tensor, _ = tensor_map[x]
        output_tensors.append(tensor)
    
    if len(output_tensors) == 1:
        output_masks = [None]  # Set output_masks to None if the layer does not support masks
    else:
        output_masks = [None for _ in output_tensors]  # Set masks for each output tensor to None

    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name), output_masks

# Example usage
if __name__ == '__main__':
    model = build_model()
    cloned_model, output_masks = clone_model(model)
    # model = multi_gpu_model(model, cpu_relocation=True)  # it uses clone_model when set cpu_relocation=True
```

In the corrected code, the handling of output_masks is updated to account for layers that do not support masks and to handle multiple output tensors. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
