The issue arises from the fact that the function is not handling the case where the layer.compute_mask() function returns None for layers that do not support using masks. This is causing an AssertionError when trying to compute the output tensor.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the section where it computes the output masks for the layers.

The bug's cause is related to the fact that layer.compute_mask() always returns None for layers that do not support using masks, leading to an incorrect computation of the output masks.

To fix the bug, we need to update the code to handle the case where layer.compute_mask() returns None for layers without mask support, and ensure that the output tensors are computed correctly.

The corrected code for the problematic function is provided below:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (rest of the function remains the same)

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # set mask to None initially

    # Iterated over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    depth_keys = list(model._nodes_by_depth.keys())
    depth_keys.sort(reverse=True)
    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # ... (rest of the code remains the same)

            if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
                # Call layer.
                if node.arguments:
                    kwargs = node.arguments
                else:
                    kwargs = {}
                # ... (rest of the code remains the same)
                
                # Update tensor_map with None for output masks if layer does not support using masks
                for x, y in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors):
                    tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # set mask to None

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs,
    # then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)
        tensor, _ = tensor_map[x]
        output_tensors.append(tensor)
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

With this updated code, we explicitly set the mask to None for output tensors when the layer does not support using masks. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the function works correctly for models with layers that do not support using masks.

The output from the corrected function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided, and successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
