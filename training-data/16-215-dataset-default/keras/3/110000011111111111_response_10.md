The potential error location within the problematic function is in the section where it checks for computed masks and sets the output_masks. The issue seems to be related to the `output_masks` always being set to `None` due to the use of a layer which does not support masks.

Based on the failing test and error message, it seems that the problematic function is unable to compute the output tensor for the model. This is likely due to an issue with the computation of masks for the layers in the model.

The GitHub issue further confirms that the problem arises when using a layer with multiple outputs without mask support.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_clone_functional_model` function to handle the scenario where a layer does not support masks. We can update the function to handle the case when the layer's `compute_mask` method returns `None`.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (existing function code)

    # (existing code...)

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    # Iterated over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    depth_keys = list(model._nodes_by_depth.keys())
    depth_keys.sort(reverse=True)
    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # ... (existing code)

            # Get or create layer.
            if layer not in layer_map:
                # Clone layer.
                new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
                layer_map[layer] = new_layer
                layer = new_layer
            else:
                # Reuse previously cloned layer.
                layer = layer_map[layer]
                # Don't call InputLayer multiple times.
                if isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
                    continue

            # ... (existing code)

            # Output masks calculation
            output_masks = None
            if has_arg(layer.call, 'mask'):
                if any(computed_masks):
                    output_masks = to_list(layer.compute_mask(computed_tensors, computed_masks))
            tensor_map[node.output_tensors] = (output_tensors, output_masks)

    # ... (existing code)

    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

With the corrected function, we now handle the case where the layer's `compute_mask` method returns `None`. This should solve the issue of "Could not compute output Tensor" error and allow the `clone_model` function to work as expected.

By making the above correction, the function should pass the failing test and also satisfy the expected input/output variable information. Additionally, it should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
