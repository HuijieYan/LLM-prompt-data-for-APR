Potential error:
The potential error in the provided function is the incorrect handling of the model inputs and outputs, as well as the creation of new layers and weights.

Bug cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect creation and mapping of the input and output tensors, as well as the cloning of layers and weights. This can lead to a mismatch between the original model and the cloned model.

Approach for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the input and output tensors, as well as ensure that the layers and weights are correctly cloned without causing any mismatches.

Corrected code:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, InputLayer
from tensorflow.python.keras import backend as K
from tensorflow.python.keras.utils.generic_utils import to_list, has_arg
from tensorflow.python.keras.layers import Sequential

def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)

    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    input_layers = model._input_layers
    input_tensors = input_tensors if input_tensors is not None else [Input(batch_shape=layer.input_shape, dtype=layer.dtype, sparse=layer.sparse, name=layer.name) for layer in input_layers]

    layer_map = {}
    tensor_map = {}
    
    for original_input, new_input in zip(input_layers, input_tensors):
        layer_map[original_input] = new_input

    for layer in model.layers:
        if layer not in layer_map:
            cloned_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
            layer_map[layer] = cloned_layer

    for node in model._nodes:
        layer = node.outbound_layer

        if layer not in layer_map:
            cloned_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
            layer_map[layer] = cloned_layer
        else:
            layer = layer_map[layer]
            
        reference_input_tensors = node.input_tensors
        computed_tensors = [tensor_map[tensor][0] for tensor in reference_input_tensors]

        if node.arguments:
            kwargs = node.arguments
        else:
            kwargs = {}
        
        if isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
            continue
        else:
            output_tensors = to_list(layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs))
            tensor_map[node.output_tensors[0]] = (output_tensors[0], None)

    outputs = [tensor_map[tensor][0] for tensor in model.outputs]
    return Model(input_tensors, outputs, name=model.name)

```

In the corrected code, we handle the creation and mapping of input tensors, properly clone the layers, and take care of input and output relationships to ensure the cloned model is an exact replica of the original model.
