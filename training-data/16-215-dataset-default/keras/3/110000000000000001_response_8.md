1. The buggy function is designed to clone a functional `Model` instance by creating new layers and weights without sharing them with the original model. The function loops through the nodes of the original model, clones the layers, and builds a new model with new input and output tensors.

2. The potential error location within the function could be in the part where it loops through the nodes of the original model, clones the layers, and builds a new model with new input and output tensors. It seems that there may be an issue with how the input and output tensors are being handled and mapped.

3. The bug's cause lies in the incorrect handling of input and output tensors, particularly in the mapping of input and output tensors, and the cloning of layers.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include revisiting the logic for handling input and output tensors, ensuring that the correct mapping between the original and cloned layers is performed, and verifying that the model is correctly instantiated with the new input and output tensors.

5. Corrected code:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model, Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, InputLayer
from tensorflow.python.keras.utils import to_list, has_arg
from tensorflow.python.framework import ops as K


def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)

    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers.
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}

    if input_tensors is None:
        # Create placeholders to build the model on top of.
        input_tensors = [Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape, dtype=layer.dtype, sparse=layer.sparse, name=layer.name) for layer in model._input_layers]

    for _original, _cloned in zip(model._input_layers, input_tensors):
        layer_map[_original] = _cloned

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    for layer in model.layers:
        new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
        layer_map[layer] = new_layer

    output_tensors = [tensor_map[x][0] for x in model.outputs]
    
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```
In the corrected code, the function's approach to handling the input and output tensors has been simplified. It directly creates new input tensors if input_tensors are not provided, then iterates through the layers of the original model to clone each layer and create a new model with the new input and output tensors. This should resolve the issues encountered in the original buggy function.
