The issue in the `_clone_functional_model` function is that the `input_layers` list is not populated correctly when `input_tensors` is None. As a result, the layer mappings are incorrect, which leads to the error when computing the model outputs.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the `input_layers` list is populated with the newly created input layers when `input_tensors` is None. Additionally, we need to correctly map the original input layers to the cloned input layers in the `layer_map`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers.
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}
    if input_tensors is None:
        # Create placeholders to build the model on top of.
        input_layers = []
        cloned_input_layers = []
        input_tensors = []
        for layer in model._input_layers:
            input_tensor = Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape,
                                 dtype=layer.dtype,
                                 sparse=layer.sparse,
                                 name=layer.name)
            input_tensors.append(input_tensor)
            input_layers.append(layer)  # Cache original input layer
            cloned_input_layers.append(input_tensor)  # Cache newly created input layer

            # Cache newly created input layer.
            layer_map[layer] = input_tensor
        for _original, _cloned in zip(input_layers, cloned_input_layers):
            layer_map[_original] = _cloned
    else:
        # Make sure that all input tensors come from a Keras layer.
        # If tensor comes from an input layer: cache the input layer.
        input_tensors = to_list(input_tensors)
        _input_tensors = []
        for i, x in enumerate(input_tensors):
            if not K.is_keras_tensor(x):
                name = model._input_layers[i].name
                input_tensor = Input(tensor=x,
                                     name='input_wrapper_for_' + name)
                _input_tensors.append(input_tensor)
                # Cache newly created input layer.
                original_input_layer = model._input_layers[i]
                newly_created_input_layer = input_tensor._keras_history[0]
                layer_map[original_input_layer] = newly_created_input_layer
            else:
                _input_tensors.append(x)
        input_tensors = _input_tensors

    # ... (remaining code remains unchanged)
```

With this correction, the `input_layers` list is correctly populated and the mappings in the `layer_map` are updated accordingly. This should address the issue and ensure that the model outputs can be computed correctly.
