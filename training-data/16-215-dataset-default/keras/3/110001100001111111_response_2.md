The potential error location within the problematic function is when it is trying to compute the output masks for layers that do not support masks, resulting in the `None` values for output_masks.

The cause of the bug is that the function is assuming all layers support masks, but in reality, some layers do not. This discrepancy causes the function to fail when trying to compute the output masks for certain layers.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle cases where layer.compute_mask() returns None for layers that do not support masks. It should also update the tensor_map accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (same as original function)
    
    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    # Iterated over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    depth_keys = list(model._nodes_by_depth.keys())
    depth_keys.sort(reverse=True)
    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # Recover the corresponding layer.
            layer = node.outbound_layer

            # Get or create layer.
            if layer not in layer_map:
                # Clone layer.
                new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
                layer_map[layer] = new_layer
                layer = new_layer
            else:
                # Reuse previously cloned layer.
                layer = layer_map[layer]
                # Don't call InputLayer multiple times.
                if isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
                    continue

            # Gather inputs to call the new layer.
            reference_input_tensors = node.input_tensors
            reference_output_tensors = node.output_tensors

            # If all previous input tensors are available in tensor_map,
            # then call node.inbound_layer on them.
            computed_data = []  # List of tuples (input, mask).
            for x in reference_input_tensors:
                if x in tensor_map:
                    computed_data.append(tensor_map[x])

            if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
                # Call layer.
                if node.arguments:
                    kwargs = node.arguments
                else:
                    kwargs = {}
                computed_tensors = [x[0] for x in computed_data]
                output_tensors = to_list(layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs))
                tensor_map.update(zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors))  # Update tensor_map with output tensors

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs,
    # then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)
        tensor, _ = tensor_map[x]
        output_tensors.append(tensor)
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

This corrected code should address the issue raised in the GitHub post, and it now properly handles layers that do not support masks.
