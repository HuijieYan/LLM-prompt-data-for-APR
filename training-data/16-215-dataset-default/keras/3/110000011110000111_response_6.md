The bug is that the `_clone_functional_model` function is not handling the case of a model with multiple outputs correctly. This is leading to the error "Could not compute output Tensor" when the `clone_model` function is called in the test.

The failing test `test_clone_functional_model_with_multi_outputs` creates a model with multiple outputs and then tries to clone it using `keras.models.clone_model(model)`. The error message indicates that the function is failing to compute the output Tensor for the cloned model.

The GitHub issue describes a similar issue where the user is trying to use `clone_model` with a model that has a layer with multiple outputs and no mask support. This is causing an assertion error.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_clone_functional_model` function to correctly handle models with multiple outputs, especially when there is no mask support for some layers.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
- Handling layers with multiple outputs and no mask support separately
- Checking for mask support in layers and handling it appropriately

Here is the corrected code for the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers.
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}

    if input_tensors is None:
        input_tensors = [Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape, dtype=layer.dtype, sparse=layer.sparse, name=layer.name) for layer in model._input_layers]
    else:
        input_tensors = [Input(tensor=x) if not K.is_keras_tensor(x) else x for x in input_tensors]

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    for layer in model.layers:
        new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
        layer_map[layer] = new_layer

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)

    for layer in model.layers:
        if len(layer._outbound_nodes) == 0:  # Output layer
            output_tensors = []
            for node in layer._inbound_nodes:
                for i in range(len(node.inbound_layers)):
                    inbound_layer = node.inbound_layers[i]
                    input_tensors = node.input_tensors[i]
                    if inbound_layer in layer_map:
                        inbound_layer = layer_map[inbound_layer]
                    output_tensors.append(inbound_layer(input_tensors))
            tensor_map[layer.output] = (output_tensors if len(output_tensors) > 1 else output_tensors[0], None)

    output_tensors = [tensor_map[x][0] for x in model.outputs]
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

This corrected function should correctly handle models with multiple outputs and address the issue reported in the GitHub post.
