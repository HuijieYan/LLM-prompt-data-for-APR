The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the loop where the output_masks are being assigned. The existing code assumes that the layer.compute_mask function will always return a mask, but in the case of a Lambda layer, it will always return None.

The bug's cause can be elucidated using the following information:
(a). The buggy function (_clone_functional_model)
(b). The failing test and error message
(c). Discrepancies between expected and actual input/output variable value
(d). The GitHub Issue information

The issue is that the code is not handling the case of None being returned for the output_masks from the layer.compute_mask function. This causes the assertion error when trying to compute the output_tensors.

To fix the bug, we need to update the code to handle the case when the output_masks are None. We can do this by adding a condition to check if the output_masks are not None before updating the tensor_map with the output_tensors and output_masks.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (previous code)

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    # Iterated over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    # ... (previous code)

    for x, y, mask in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors, output_masks):
        if mask is not None:  # Check if the mask is not None
            tensor_map[x] = (y, mask)  # Update the tensor_map with output_tensors and output_masks

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs,
    # then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)
        tensor, mask = tensor_map[x]  # Retrieve the tensor and mask from tensor_map
        output_tensors.append(tensor)
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the case where the output_masks are None and successfully update the tensor_map with the output_tensors and output_masks.

This corrected code should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub. It also addresses the problem where the Lambda layer does not support using masks, which was the case mentioned in the GitHub issue.
