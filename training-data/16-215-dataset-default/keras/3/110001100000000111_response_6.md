1. The buggy function is a private function `_clone_functional_model` in `keras/models.py` which is used to clone a functional `Model` instance. The GitHub issue mentions an error "Could not compute output Tensor" when using `clone_model`. The issue is related to a bug inside `clone_model` function when using `multi_gpu_model` with `cpu_relocation=True`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the section where it computes the output masks. The issue mentions that the `output_masks` will always be `[None]` instead of `[None, None]` as expected.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function is responsible for cloning a functional model by creating new layers and instantiating new weights instead of sharing the weights of the existing layers.
   (b). The related function `clone_model` is used to clone a model instance, preserving its architecture, weights, and optimizer configuration.
   (c). The GitHub issue provides a detailed description of how the problem arises when using `multi_gpu_model` when `cpu_relocation=True`, and it indicates that the issue is related to the `clone_model` function not correctly computing the output tensors and masks in certain scenarios.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Modify the code in the buggy function to properly compute the output masks when cloning the model.
   (b). Update the `clone_model` function to handle cases where the original model has multiple outputs without mask support.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers.
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}

    # Rest of the code for cloning the model goes here...

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs,
    # then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)
        tensor, mask = tensor_map[x]
        output_tensors.append(tensor)

    # Fixed code to handle cases where the original model has multiple outputs without mask support
    output_masks = [None] * len(model.outputs)  # Initialize output_masks with None
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

The corrected code includes a fix for computing the `output_masks` when cloning the model. By initializing the `output_masks` with `None` for each output tensor, it covers the case where the original model has multiple outputs without mask support. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub issue.
