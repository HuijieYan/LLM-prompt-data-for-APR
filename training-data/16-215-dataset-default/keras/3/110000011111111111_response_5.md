The issue seems to be related to the `clone_model` function from Keras which internally calls the `_clone_functional_model` function. The error message "Could not compute output Tensor" indicates that the function is failing to compute the output tensors properly, which could be due to a problem in the cloning process or the computation of tensors and masks during the cloning.

Looking at the failing test and the error message, it is evident that the `clone_model` method is failing when creating a new model from the original model. The issue is related to the computation of output tensors during the cloning process.

The error seems to occur in the `_clone_functional_model` function when it fails to compute the output tensors properly, leading to the assertion failure. The problem could be related to the computation of output tensors for layers with multiple inputs and outputs, as indicated by the failing test.

The GitHub issue further elaborates on a similar problem where the error is related to the computation of output masks for a layer without mask support.

To fix the bug:
- The computation of output tensors and masks should be reviewed, especially for layers with multiple inputs and outputs, and layers without mask support.
- It may be necessary to modify the logic for handling layers with multiple inputs and outputs to ensure that the output tensors and masks are computed correctly during the cloning process.

Here's the corrected code for the `_clone_functional_model` function that addresses the identified issues:

```python
from keras.layers import Input, InputLayer
from keras.models import Model, Sequential
from keras.utils import to_list
import keras.backend as K
from keras.layers import Input, InputLayer

        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    tensor_map = {}  
    if input_tensors is None:

                layer_map[original_input_layer] = newly_created_input_layer
            else:
                _input_tensors.append(x)
        input_tensors = _input_tensors

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  

    depth_keys = list(model._nodes_by_depth.keys())
    depth_keys.sort(reverse=True)
    for depth in depth_keys:

                    continue

            reference_input_tensors = node.input_tensors
            reference_output_tensors = node.output_tensors

            computed_data = []  
            for x in reference_input_tensors:
                if x in tensor_map:
                    computed_data.append(tensor_map[x])

            if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
                kwargs = node.arguments if node.arguments else {}
                computed_tensors = [x[0] for x in computed_data]
                computed_masks = [x[1] for x in computed_data] if any(x[1] for x in computed_data) else None

        assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)
        tensor, _ = tensor_map[x]

    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
``` 

The corrected function ensures that the output tensors are computed correctly during the cloning process, especially for layers with multiple inputs and outputs, and it addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug.

This should resolve the reported bug and allow the `clone_model` function to work as expected.
