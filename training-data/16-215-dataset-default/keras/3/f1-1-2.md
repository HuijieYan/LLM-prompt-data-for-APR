# buggy function docstring

```text
Clone a functional `Model` instance.

Model cloning is similar to calling a model on new inputs,
except that it creates new layers (and thus new weights) instead
of sharing the weights of the existing layers.

# Arguments
    model: Instance of `Model`.
    input_tensors: optional list of input tensors
        to build the model upon. If not provided,
        placeholders will be created.

# Returns
    An instance of `Model` reproducing the behavior
    of the original model, on top of new inputs tensors,
    using newly instantiated weights.

# Raises
    ValueError: in case of invalid `model` argument value.
```
