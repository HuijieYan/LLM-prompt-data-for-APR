Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test, as well as the information from the GitHub issue, the potential error location within the problematic function is in the section where it computes the output masks. The failing test indicates that the output_masks are always [None], but [None, None] is expected. This discrepancy is causing the 'Could not compute output Tensor' error.

The bug's cause is related to the Lambda layer not supporting masks, which leads to the output_masks always being None. This issue appears when using a functional model with a layer that has multiple outputs without mask support.

To fix the bug, the problematic function needs to be updated to handle the Lambda layer's lack of mask support and manage the output_masks accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)

    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    # existing code...

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    # existing code...

    for x, y, mask in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors, output_masks):
        if mask is None and has_arg(layer.call, 'mask'):
            mask = layer.compute_mask(x, None)
        tensor_map[x] = (y, mask)

    # existing code...

    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        tensor, mask = tensor_map[x]
        assert tensor is not None, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)
        output_tensors.append(tensor)
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

With these changes, the code should now handle the Lambda layer's lack of mask support and correctly manage the output_masks, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub thread.

The updated function has been modified to include handling for the lack of masks for the Lambda layer's outputs, ensuring that the assertion for computed output tensors passes successfully. This should address the 'Could not compute output Tensor' error.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. It also addresses the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
