The potential error in the function `_clone_functional_model` is likely in the section where it iterates over every node in the reference model. This section seems to be responsible for creating new layers and updating the tensor_map. 

The cause of the bug could be due to incorrect indexing or handling of the layers and tensors, leading to inconsistencies in the cloning process. 

To fix the bug, potential approaches include:
- Ensuring that the reference_input_tensors and reference_output_tensors are correctly mapped to the corresponding tensors in the tensor_map
- Checking the handling of the layers to ensure that the new layers are correctly instantiated and used in the model cloning process

The corrected code is as follows:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)

    input_layers = model.inputs
    output_layers = model.outputs
    new_input_layers = []
    layer_map = {}

    for layer in input_layers:
        new_input_layer = Input(batch_shape=layer.shape, dtype=layer.dtype, sparse=layer.sparse, name=layer.name)
        new_input_layers.append(new_input_layer)
        layer_map[layer.name] = new_input_layer.name

    for layer in model.layers:
        config = layer.get_config()
        new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(config)
        new_layer_name = layer.name + '_clone'
        new_layer.name = new_layer_name
        layer_map[layer.name] = new_layer_name

    new_output_layers = [layer_map[layer.name] for layer in output_layers]

    cloned_model = Model(inputs=new_input_layers, outputs=new_output_layers)

    return cloned_model
```

In the corrected version, the function iterates through the input and output layers, creates new layers and input tensors, and then constructs a new `Model` instance using the new input and output layers. Additionally, it maintains a `layer_map` to keep track of the original and cloned layers and input tensors.
