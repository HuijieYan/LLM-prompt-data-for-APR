1. The buggy function `_clone_functional_model` is responsible for cloning a functional `Model` instance in Keras. The function is being called internally in the `clone_model` function, which is referenced in the GitHub issue. The issue describes a problem with `multi_gpu_model` using `cpu_relocation=True`.

2. The potential location of the error within the `_clone_functional_model` function can be identified in the section where it computes the output tensors and masks for each layer in the model. Specifically, the issue in the GitHub post mentions that `Layer.compute_mask` always returns `None` for certain layers (e.g., Lambda), causing the "Could not compute output Tensor" error.

3. The bug's cause can be elucidated as follows:
   (a). The `_clone_functional_model` function does not handle layers without mask support correctly, causing the issue to arise when computing output tensors and masks for such layers.
   (b). The related `clone_model` function uses `_clone_functional_model` for model cloning, and this could be the source of the problem mentioned in the GitHub issue.
   (c). The GitHub issue provides information about how the error occurs due to the inability to compute masks for certain layers (e.g., Lambda) and suggests that this leads to the AssertionError when using `multi_gpu_model`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Update the `_clone_functional_model` function to handle layers without mask support appropriately when computing output tensors and masks.
   - Consider modifying the behavior of `clone_model` or `multi_gpu_model` to account for layers without mask support.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function `_clone_functional_model`:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    """
    Clone a functional `Model` instance.

    Model cloning is similar to calling a model on new inputs,
    except that it creates new layers (and thus new weights) instead
    of sharing the weights of the existing layers.

    # Arguments
        model: Instance of `Model`.
        input_tensors: optional list of input tensors
            to build the model upon. If not provided,
            placeholders will be created.

    # Returns
        An instance of `Model` reproducing the behavior
        of the original model, on top of new inputs tensors,
        using newly instantiated weights.

    # Raises
        ValueError: in case of invalid `model` argument value.
    """
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument '
                         'to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument '
                         'to be a functional `Model` instance, '
                         'got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    # ... (unchanged code)

    # Iterated over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    depth_keys = list(model._nodes_by_depth.keys())
    depth_keys.sort(reverse=True)
    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # Recover the corresponding layer.
            layer = node.outbound_layer

            # Get or create layer.
            if layer not in layer_map:
                # Clone layer.
                new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
                layer_map[layer] = new_layer
                layer = new_layer
            else:
                # Reuse previously cloned layer.
                layer = layer_map[layer]
                # Don't call InputLayer multiple times.
                if isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
                    continue

            # Gather inputs to call the new layer.
            reference_input_tensors = node.input_tensors
            reference_output_tensors = node.output_tensors

            # If all previous input tensors are available in tensor_map,
            # then call node.inbound_layer on them.
            computed_data = []  # List of tuples (input, mask).
            for x in reference_input_tensors:
                if x in tensor_map:
                    computed_data.append(tensor_map[x])

            if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
                # Call layer.
                kwargs = node.arguments if node.arguments else {}
                computed_tensors = [x[0] for x in computed_data]
                computed_masks = [x[1] for x in computed_data]
                output_tensors = to_list(layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs))
                tensor_map.update(zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors))

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs,
    # then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = [tensor_map[x] for x in model.outputs]
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

This corrected code includes an updated approach to handle the computation of output tensors and masks for layers without mask support, as mentioned in the GitHub issue. This should address the "Could not compute output Tensor" error when using `multi_gpu_model` with `cpu_relocation=True`.
