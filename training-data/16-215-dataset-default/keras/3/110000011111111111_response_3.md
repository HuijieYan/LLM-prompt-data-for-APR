The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of multiple outputs from a Lambda layer without mask support in the `_clone_functional_model` function. The failing test case involves a model with multiple outputs from a Lambda layer, and the error message indicates that the output tensors cannot be computed.

The issue on GitHub also describes a similar problem where the output_masks are always None due to the Lambda layer not supporting masks, leading to the error.

To fix the bug, the `_clone_functional_model` function needs to be modified to handle multiple outputs from a layer without mask support correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # existing code

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    # Iterate over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    depth_keys = list(model._nodes_by_depth.keys())
    depth_keys.sort(reverse=True)
    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # existing code

            reference_output_tensors = node.output_tensors

            computed_data = []  # List of tuples (input, mask).
            for x in reference_input_tensors:
                if x in tensor_map:
                    computed_data.append(tensor_map[x])

            if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
                # Call layer.
                output_tensors = layer.call(computed_tensors)  # Simplified for brevity
                for x, y in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors):
                    tensor_map[x] = (y, None)

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs,
    # then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = [tensor_map[x][0] for x in model.outputs]
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle multiple outputs from a layer without mask support.

This corrected code should also resolve the issue described in the GitHub post.
