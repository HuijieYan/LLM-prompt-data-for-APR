The problematic function `_clone_functional_model` is designed to clone a functional `Model` instance by creating new layers and weights instead of sharing the weights of the existing layers. The failing test `test_clone_functional_model_with_multi_outputs` is trying to clone a functional model with multiple outputs, but it's encountering an error because the `assert` statement on line 166 of the `_clone_functional_model` function is failing, indicating that it couldn't compute an output Tensor with the name "swap_layer_1/Identity:0".

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the loop that iterates over every node in the reference model. It seems that the function is trying to clone the layers and their configurations, but it's not handling multi-output layers properly.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling layers with multiple outputs, leading to a failure in computing the output tensors.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_clone_functional_model` function to properly handle layers with multiple outputs and ensure that the cloning process is done correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model, Sequential, Input
from tensorflow.keras.layers import InputLayer
import tensorflow.keras.backend as K
from tensorflow.python.keras.models import clone_model
import numpy as np

def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    cloned_layers = {}  # Cache for created layers.
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}

    if input_tensors is None:
        # Create placeholders to build the model on top of.
        input_tensors = [Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape, dtype=layer.dtype, sparse=layer.sparse, name=layer.name) for layer in model._input_layers]
    else:
        for i, inputs in enumerate(input_tensors):
            if not K.is_keras_tensor(inputs):
                input_layer = Input(tensor=inputs, name='input_wrapper_for_' + model._input_layers[i].name)
                input_tensors[i] = input_layer

    for original_input, cloned_input in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[original_input] = (cloned_input, None)  # tensor, mask

    for depth in model._nodes_by_depth.keys():
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            outbound_layer = node.outbound_layer

            if outbound_layer not in cloned_layers:
                new_layer = outbound_layer.__class__.from_config(outbound_layer.get_config())
                cloned_layers[outbound_layer] = new_layer
            else:
                new_layer = cloned_layers[outbound_layer]

            if isinstance(new_layer, InputLayer):
                continue

            input_tensors = [tensor_map[x][0] for x in node.input_tensors if x in tensor_map]
            computed_data = [(tensor_map[x][0], tensor_map[x][1]) for x in node.input_tensors if x in tensor_map]

            if len(computed_data) == len(node.input_tensors):
                kwargs = {arg: getattr(node, arg) for arg in outbound_layer._fn_args}
                if len(computed_data) == 1:
                    computed_tensor, computed_mask = computed_data[0]
                    if hasattr(new_layer.call, 'mask') and 'mask' not in kwargs:
                        kwargs['mask'] = computed_mask
                    output_tensors = K.in_train_phase(lambda: new_layer.call(computed_tensor, **kwargs), training=None)
                    output_tokens = K.in_train_phase(lambda: new_layer.compute_mask(computed_tensor, computed_mask), training=None)
                    computed_tensors = [computed_tensor]
                    computed_masks = [computed_mask]
                else:
                    computed_tensors = [x[0] for x in computed_data]
                    computed_masks = [x[1] for x in computed_data]
                    if hasattr(new_layer.call, 'mask') and 'mask' not in kwargs:
                        kwargs['mask'] = computed_masks
                    output_tensors = K.in_train_phase(lambda: new_layer.call(computed_tensors, **kwargs), training=None)
                    output_masks = K.in_train_phase(lambda: new_layer.compute_mask(computed_tensors, computed_masks), training=None)

                for x, y, mask in zip(node.output_tensors, output_tensors, output_masks):
                    tensor_map[x] = (y, mask)

    output_tensors = [tensor_map[x][0] for x in model.outputs]
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)

```

The corrected code uses a new dictionary `cloned_layers` to cache the created layers to avoid redundant cloning, properly handles input tensors, and correctly computes output tensors, taking into account layers with multiple outputs. This correction addresses the issues identified and should resolve the failing test for cloning a functional model with multiple outputs.
