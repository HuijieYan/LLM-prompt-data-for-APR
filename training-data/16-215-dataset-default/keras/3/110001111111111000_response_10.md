The issue in the `_clone_functional_model` function arises from the fact that the `input_layers` list is empty, leading to an incomplete creation of input layers when `input_tensors` is None.

To fix this, we need to ensure that input layers are properly created and stored in the `input_layers` list if `input_tensors` is None. Additionally, we'll update the `input_tensors` list to include the newly created input tensors.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (other parts of the function remain the same)

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers.
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}

    if input_tensors is None:
        # Create placeholders to build the model on top of.
        input_layers = []
        input_tensors = []
        for i, layer in enumerate(model._input_layers):
            input_tensor = keras.layers.Input(batch_shape=layer.input.shape,
                                              dtype=layer.dtype,
                                              sparse=layer.sparse,
                                              name=layer.name)
            input_tensors.append(input_tensor)
            # Cache newly created input layer.
            input_layers.append(layer)
            newly_created_input_layer = input_tensor._keras_history[0]
            layer_map[layer] = newly_created_input_layer

    # ... (remaining code remains the same)
```

With the above changes, the function addresses the issue related to the creation of input layers and should now return the expected output, resolving the assertion error.
