The bug in the given code seems to be related to the creation of input_tensors and input_layers. The input_tensors list is being populated correctly, but the input_layers list is not being used to populate the layer_map.

The bug seems to be occurring when populating the input_layers list. The variable input_layers is being created, but it is not being used to populate the layer_map.

To fix this bug, we need to make sure that the input_layers list is correctly used to populate the layer_map. Additionally, the input_tensors list seems to be incorrectly using the original input_tensors instead of the newly created input_tensors.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers.
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}
    if input_tensors is None:
        # Create placeholders to build the model on top of.
        input_tensors = []
        for layer in model._input_layers:
            input_tensor = Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape,
                                 dtype=layer.dtype,
                                 sparse=layer.sparse,
                                 name=layer.name)
            input_tensors.append(input_tensor)
            # Cache newly created input layer.
            newly_created_input_layer = input_tensor._keras_history[0]
            layer_map[layer] = newly_created_input_layer
    else:
        # Make sure that all input tensors come from a Keras layer.
        # If tensor comes from an input layer: cache the input layer.
        input_tensors = to_list(input_tensors)
        for i in range(len(input_tensors)):
            x = input_tensors[i]
            if not K.is_keras_tensor(x):
                name = model._input_layers[i].name
                input_tensor = Input(tensor=x,
                                     name='input_wrapper_for_' + name)
                input_tensors[i] = input_tensor
                # Cache newly created input layer.
                original_input_layer = x._keras_history[0]
                newly_created_input_layer = input_tensor._keras_history[0]
                layer_map[original_input_layer] = newly_created_input_layer

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged

```
By making these changes, we ensure that the input_layers list is used to populate the layer_map, and the input_tensors list is correctly updated with the newly created input tensors.
