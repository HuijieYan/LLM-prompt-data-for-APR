The bug in the provided function is likely to be caused by the incorrect handling of input_tensors and input_layers in the function. The function is not properly creating new input layers and updating the layer_map and tensor_map based on the input_tensors provided.

To fix this bug, the function needs to correctly handle the input_tensors and input_layers, ensuring that they are properly mapped and updated in the layer_map and tensor_map dictionaries. Additionally, it should also ensure that the new input layers are appropriately created and added to the input_tensors list.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers.
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}
    
    # Create placeholders to build the model on top of if input_tensors is not provided.
    if input_tensors is None:
        input_layers = model._input_layers.copy()  # Copy the input layers
        input_tensors = [Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape,
                               dtype=layer.dtype,
                               sparse=layer.sparse,
                               name=layer.name) for layer in input_layers]
        
        for original, cloned in zip(model._input_layers, input_tensors):
            layer_map[original] = cloned  # Update layer_map

    else:
        input_tensors = to_list(input_tensors)
        for i, x in enumerate(input_tensors):
            if not K.is_keras_tensor(x):
                name = model._input_layers[i].name
                input_tensor = Input(tensor=x, name='input_wrapper_for_' + name)
                input_tensors[i] = input_tensor  # Replace non-Keras input with wrapped input tensor
                layer_map[x] = input_tensor  # Update layer_map

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # Add input tensor to tensor_map

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs,
    # then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)
        tensor, _ = tensor_map[x]
        output_tensors.append(tensor)
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

In this corrected code, the function now properly handles the input_tensors, creates new input layers if needed, and updates the layer_map and tensor_map accordingly. This should address the bug and ensure that the function works as intended.
