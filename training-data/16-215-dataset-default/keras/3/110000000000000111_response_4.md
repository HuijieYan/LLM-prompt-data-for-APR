1. The buggy function is a clone function for a Keras functional model. The GitHub issue is related to using `clone_model()` with `multi_gpu_model` and encountering an error when trying to compute the output. The issue seems to be related to the masks not being supported for certain layers.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely related to the handling of masks for layers that do not support masks, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

3. (a) The buggy function seems to be encountering an issue with the computation of output tensors and masks, especially for layers that do not support masks.
   (b) The GitHub issue provides detailed information on how the issue is encountered when using `clone_model` in conjunction with `multi_gpu_model` and also highlights the specific lines in the code where the issue is related to the computation of masks for certain layers.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could involve:
   - Modifying the function to handle layers that do not support masks in a different way, perhaps by checking for mask support before attempting to compute masks.
   - Ensuring that the output tensors and masks are computed correctly for all types of layers, including those that do not support masks.

5.  Here is the corrected code for the problematic function that takes into account the suggestions for fixing the bug:

```python
from tensorflow.python.keras.utils.list_utils import to_list
from tensorflow.python.keras.layers import Input, InputLayer
from tensorflow.python.keras.engine.network import Node
from tensorflow.python.keras.engine.network import Network
from tensorflow.python.keras.engine.functional import Functional
from tensorflow.python.keras.models import Sequential, Model
from tensorflow.python.keras.utils.layer_utils import has_arg
from tensorflow.python.keras import backend as K

def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, (Sequential, Functional)):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)

    network = model._inbound_nodes    # Use the private attribute to access the network
    new_network = Network(input_tensors)
  
    for layer in model.layers:
        new_network.add(layer)

    return new_network
```

This corrected code simplifies the functional model cloning by directly adding the layers from the original model to the new network, avoiding the issues related to computing masks for certain layer types. This corrected code should resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub post.
