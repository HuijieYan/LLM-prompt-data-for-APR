1. The buggy function `_clone_functional_model` is intended to clone a functional `Model` instance. It iterates over the layers and creates new instances of each layer to build a new model with new weights. However, there are multiple potential error locations within this function.

2. The potential error locations within the function include the handling of input tensors, the creation of new layers, and the propagation of input to output tensors.

3. The cause of the bug is likely due to the improper handling of input tensors, including the creation of placeholders and the mapping of input tensors to corresponding output tensors. The function also fails to properly handle the creation of new layers and the propagation of input to output tensors, leading to incorrect cloning of the model.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the input tensors are properly handled, the layers are created correctly, and the input to output tensors are mapped accurately.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model, Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, InputLayer
from tensorflow.python.keras.utils.list_utils import to_list
from tensorflow.python.keras.utils.layer_utils import has_arg
import tensorflow.keras.backend as K

def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)

    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers.
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}

    if input_tensors is None:
        input_tensors = [Input(batch_shape=layer.output_shape) for layer in model.layers]
        
    for input_layer, original_input_layer in zip(input_tensors, model.input_layers):
        layer_map[original_input_layer] = input_layer

    for layer in model.layers:
        # Clone layer.
        new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
        layer_map[layer] = new_layer

    for node in model.nodes:
        inbound_layers = [layer_map[inbound_layer] for inbound_layer in node.inbound_layers]
        
        kwargs = node.arguments if node.arguments else {}
        output_tensors = to_list(layer_map[node.outbound_layer](inbound_layers, **kwargs))

        for original_output_tensor, output_tensor in zip(node.output_tensors, output_tensors):
            tensor_map[original_output_tensor] = (output_tensor, None)  # tensor, mask

    output_tensors = [tensor_map[output_tensor][0] for output_tensor in model.output_tensors]

    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```
In the corrected code, we initialize input tensors based on the output shape of the layers, map input layers to input tensors, clone each layer, update the map with the output tensors of each node, and finally construct the new model with the input and output tensors. This approach ensures correct cloning of the functional model.
