1. The `_clone_functional_model` function is meant to clone a functional `Model` instance, creating new layers and weights instead of sharing the weights of the existing layers. The failing test `test_clone_functional_model_with_multi_outputs` is trying to clone a functional model with multiple outputs, but it fails with an assertion error while checking the model outputs.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the logic where it iterates over every node in the reference model and attempts to clone layers.

3. The bug is caused by incorrect handling of layers and their input/output tensors during the cloning process. The failing test creates a model with multiple layers and multiple outputs, and during the cloning process, the function fails to properly clone the layers and their input/output tensors, leading to the assertion error when checking the model outputs.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Ensure that the cloning process correctly handles models with multiple outputs and their corresponding input/output tensors.
   - Verify that the layers are cloned properly, and their input/output tensors are appropriately mapped during the cloning process.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model, Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, InputLayer
from tensorflow.keras import backend as K
from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_list, has_arg
import numpy as np
import tensorflow.keras as keras

def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers.
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}
    if input_tensors is None:
        # Create placeholders to build the model on top of.
        input_layers = []
        input_tensors = []
        for layer in model._input_layers:
            input_tensor = Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape,
                                 dtype=layer.dtype,
                                 sparse=layer.sparse,
                                 name=layer.name)
            input_tensors.append(input_tensor)
            # Cache newly created input layer.
            newly_created_input_layer = input_tensor._keras_history[0]
            layer_map[layer] = newly_created_input_layer
        for _original, _cloned in zip(model._input_layers, input_tensors):
            layer_map[_original] = _cloned
    else:
        # Make sure that all input tensors come from a Keras layer.
        # If tensor comes from an input layer: cache the input layer.
        input_tensors = to_list(input_tensors)
        _input_tensors = []
        for i, x in enumerate(input_tensors):
            if not K.is_keras_tensor(x):
                name = model._input_layers[i].name
                input_tensor = Input(tensor=x,
                                     name='input_wrapper_for_' + name)
                _input_tensors.append(input_tensor)
                # Cache newly created input layer.
                original_input_layer = x._keras_history[0]
                newly_created_input_layer = input_tensor._keras_history[0]
                layer_map[original_input_layer] = newly_created_input_layer
            else:
                _input_tensors.append(x)
        input_tensors = _input_tensors

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    layer_config_map = {}  # Cache for layer configurations
    for layer in model.layers:
        layer_config_map[layer.name] = layer.get_config()

    for layer in model.layers:
        if layer.name not in layer_map:
            layer_config = layer_config_map[layer.name]
            layer_name = layer_config.pop('name')
            new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer_config)
            new_layer.name = layer_name
            layer_map[layer.name] = new_layer

    for i, input_layer in enumerate(model._input_layers):
        layer_map[input_layer.name] = input_tensors[i]
        
    output_tensors = [layer_map[x.name] for x in model.outputs]
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)    
```

This corrected code ensures that the cloning process correctly handles models with multiple outputs and properly maps the input and output tensors during the cloning process. It should pass the failing test `test_clone_functional_model_with_multi_outputs`.
