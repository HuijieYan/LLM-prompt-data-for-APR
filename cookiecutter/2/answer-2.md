The existing code will stop at the first valid hook it finds and return the path to this hook. To allow for multiple hooks of the same type to be used at the same time, the function should be updated to return a list of paths instead of a single path. To preserve compatibility with existing uses of the function, we'll make it return a list containing a single element if there is only one matching hook.

The modified function would look as follows:

```python
def find_hook(hook_name, hooks_dir='hooks'):
    """Return a dict of all hook scripts provided.

    Must be called with the project template as the current working directory.
    Dict's key will be the hook/script's name, without extension, while values
    will be the absolute path to the script. Missing scripts will not be
    included in the returned dict.

    :param hook_name: The hook to find
    :param hooks_dir: The hook directory in the template
    :return: The absolute paths to the hook scripts or None
    """
    logger.debug('hooks_dir is %s', os.path.abspath(hooks_dir))

    if not os.path.isdir(hooks_dir):
        logger.debug('No hooks/dir in template_dir')
        return None

    scripts = []
    for hook_file in os.listdir(hooks_dir):
        if valid_hook(hook_file, hook_name):
            scripts.append(os.path.abspath(os.path.join(hooks_dir, hook_file)))

    return scripts if scripts else None
```
Please note that if the caller of this function expects a single path as a string, they may need to be updated to handle a list of strings instead.
