The `NameError: global name 'output_path' is not defined'` error suggests that the variable `output_path` is not defined in the local or the global scope before it's used. In this case, you are attempting to open a file located at `output_path`, but this variable is never defined or assigned. 

To fix the bug, you should replace `output_path` with `output`, as the function seems to assume that if `output` is not `None` and is an instance of `pycompat.PathLike` or `str`, it should be treated as a file path. 

Here is the corrected version of your code:

	def get_write_function(output):
		if output is None:
			def write(s):
				stderr = sys.stderr
				stderr.write(s)
		elif isinstance(output, (pycompat.PathLike, str)):
			def write(s):
				with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
					output_file.write(s)
		else:
			assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
			def write(s):
				output.write(s)

		return write
