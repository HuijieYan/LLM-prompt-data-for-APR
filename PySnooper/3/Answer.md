To fix the bug and meet the requirements you've provided, you can modify the code as follows:

    def get_write_function(output):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (pycompat.PathLike, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:  # Change output_path to output
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write

Changes made:

In the line with open(output_path, 'a') as output_file:, I changed output_path to output to use the correct variable name.
The change only affects the line with the bug and does not modify any other parts of the code.

This change should fix the NameError issue without affecting other parts of the code or existing tests that have already passed.
