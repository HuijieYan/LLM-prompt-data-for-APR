You can fix the bug in the given code snippet by making the following changes:

1. Import the necessary modules at the top of the file: `import sys` and `from typing import Union, Optional, Callable` (Assuming `pycompat` and `utils` are already imported).
2. Update the function signature to include proper type hinting.
3. Correct the variable name `output_path` to `output` in the `elif` block.

Here's the fixed code snippet:

```python
import sys
from typing import Union, Optional, Callable
# Assuming pycompat and utils are already imported

def get_write_function(output: Optional[Union[pycompat.PathLike, str, utils.WritableStream]]) -> Callable[[str], None]:
    if output is None:
        def write(s: str) -> None:
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (pycompat.PathLike, str)):
        def write(s: str) -> None:
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s: str) -> None:
            output.write(s)

    return write
```

With these changes, the fixed patch should be able to pass the failed tests without affecting any previously-passed tests, and it can be used directly in the original project.
