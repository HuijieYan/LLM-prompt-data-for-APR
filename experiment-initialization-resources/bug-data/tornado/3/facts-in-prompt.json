The keyword argument ``force_instance=True``\n    can be used to suppress this singleton behavior. Unless\n    ``force_instance=True`` is used, no arguments should be passed to\n    the `AsyncHTTPClient` constructor. The implementation subclass as\n    well as arguments to its constructor can be set with the static\n    method `configure()`\n    \n    All `AsyncHTTPClient` implementations support a ``defaults``\n    keyword argument, which can be used to set default values for\n    `HTTPRequest` attributes.  For example::\n    \n        AsyncHTTPClient.configure(\n            None, defaults=dict(user_agent=\"MyUserAgent\"))\n        # or with force_instance:\n        client = AsyncHTTPClient(force_instance=True,\n            defaults=dict(user_agent=\"MyUserAgent\"))\n    \n    .. versionchanged:: 5.0\n       The ``io_loop`` argument (deprecated since version 4.1) has been removed.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # ... omitted code ...\n\n\n",
