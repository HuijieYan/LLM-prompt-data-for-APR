The \"handshake\" is\n    HTTP, but after the handshake, the protocol is\n    message-based. Consequently, most of the Tornado HTTP facilities\n    are not available in handlers of this type. The only communication\n    methods available to you are `write_message()`, `ping()`, and\n    `close()`. Likewise, your request handler class should implement\n    `open()` method rather than ``get()`` or ``post()``.\n    \n    If you map the handler above to ``/websocket`` in your application, you can\n    invoke it in JavaScript with::\n    \n      var ws = new WebSocket(\"ws://localhost:8888/websocket\");\n      ws.onopen = function() {\n         ws.send(\"Hello, world\");\n      };\n      ws.onmessage = function (evt) {\n         alert(evt.data);\n      };\n    \n    This script pops up an alert box that says \"You said: Hello, world\".\n    \n    Web browsers allow any site to open a websocket connection to any other,\n    instead of using the same-origin policy that governs other network\n    access from javascript.  This can be surprising and is a potential\n    security hole, so since Tornado 4.0 `WebSocketHandler` requires\n    applications that wish to receive cross-origin websockets to opt in\n    by overriding the `~WebSocketHandler.check_origin` method (see that\n    method's docs for details).  Failure to do so is the most likely\n    cause of 403 errors when making a websocket connection.\n    \n    When using a secure websocket connection (``wss://``) with a self-signed\n    certificate, the connection from a browser may fail because it wants\n    to show the \"accept this certificate\" dialog but has nowhere to show it.\n    You must first visit a regular HTML page using the same certificate\n    to accept it before the websocket connection will succeed.\n    \n    If the application setting ``websocket_ping_interval`` has a non-zero\n    value, a ping will be sent periodically, and the connection will be\n    closed if a response is not received before the ``websocket_ping_timeout``.\n    \n    Messages larger than the ``websocket_max_message_size`` application setting\n    (default 10MiB) will not be accepted.\n    \n    .. versionchanged:: 4.5\n       Added ``websocket_ping_interval``, ``websocket_ping_timeout``, and\n       ``websocket_max_message_size``.\n    \"\"\"\n\n\n",
