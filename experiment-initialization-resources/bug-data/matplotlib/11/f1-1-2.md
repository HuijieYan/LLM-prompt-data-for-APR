# buggy function docstring

```text
Return the `.Bbox` bounding the text, in display units.

In addition to being used internally, this is useful for specifying
clickable regions in a png file on a web page.

Parameters
----------
renderer : Renderer, optional
    A renderer is needed to compute the bounding box.  If the artist
    has already been drawn, the renderer is cached; thus, it is only
    necessary to pass this argument when calling `get_window_extent`
    before the first `draw`.  In practice, it is usually easier to
    trigger a draw first (e.g. by saving the figure).

dpi : float, optional
    The dpi value for computing the bbox, defaults to
    ``self.figure.dpi`` (*not* the renderer dpi); should be set e.g. if
    to match regions with a figure saved with a custom dpi value.
