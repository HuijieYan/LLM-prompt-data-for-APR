# buggy function docstring

```text
Use this light source to adjust the colors of the *rgb* input array to
give the impression of a shaded relief map with the given *elevation*.

Parameters
----------
rgb : array-like
    An (M, N, 3) RGB array, assumed to be in the range of 0 to 1.
elevation : array-like
    An (M, N) array of the height values used to generate a shaded map.
fraction : number
    Increases or decreases the contrast of the hillshade.  Values
    greater than one will cause intermediate values to move closer to
    full illumination or shadow (and clipping any values that move
    beyond 0 or 1). Note that this is not visually or mathematically
    the same as vertical exaggeration.
blend_mode : {'hsv', 'overlay', 'soft'} or callable, optional
    The type of blending used to combine the colormapped data values
    with the illumination intensity.  For backwards compatibility, this
    defaults to "hsv". Note that for most topographic surfaces,
    "overlay" or "soft" appear more visually realistic. If a
    user-defined function is supplied, it is expected to combine an
    MxNx3 RGB array of floats (ranging 0 to 1) with an MxNx1 hillshade
    array (also 0 to 1).  (Call signature
    ``func(rgb, illum, **kwargs)``)
    Additional kwargs supplied to this function will be passed on to
    the *blend_mode* function.
vert_exag : number, optional
    The amount to exaggerate the elevation values by when calculating
    illumination. This can be used either to correct for differences in
    units between the x-y coordinate system and the elevation
    coordinate system (e.g. decimal degrees vs. meters) or to
    exaggerate or de-emphasize topography.
dx : number, optional
    The x-spacing (columns) of the input *elevation* grid.
dy : number, optional
    The y-spacing (rows) of the input *elevation* grid.
Additional kwargs are passed on to the *blend_mode* function.

Returns
-------
ndarray
    An (m, n, 3) array of floats ranging between 0-1.
