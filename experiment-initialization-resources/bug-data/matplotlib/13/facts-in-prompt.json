For example, to represent a cubic curve, you must\n    provide three vertices as well as three codes ``CURVE3``.\n    \n    The code types are:\n    \n    - ``STOP``   :  1 vertex (ignored)\n        A marker for the end of the entire path (currently not required and\n        ignored)\n    \n    - ``MOVETO`` :  1 vertex\n        Pick up the pen and move to the given vertex.\n    \n    - ``LINETO`` :  1 vertex\n        Draw a line from the current position to the given vertex.\n    \n    - ``CURVE3`` :  1 control point, 1 endpoint\n        Draw a quadratic Bezier curve from the current position, with the given\n        control point, to the given end point.\n    \n    - ``CURVE4`` :  2 control points, 1 endpoint\n        Draw a cubic Bezier curve from the current position, with the given\n        control points, to the given end point.\n    \n    - ``CLOSEPOLY`` : 1 vertex (ignored)\n        Draw a line segment to the start point of the current polyline.\n    \n    If *codes* is None, it is interpreted as a ``MOVETO`` followed by a series\n    of ``LINETO``.\n    \n    Users of Path objects should not access the vertices and codes arrays\n    directly.  Instead, they should use `iter_segments` or `cleaned` to get the\n    vertex/code pairs.  This helps, in particular, to consistently handle the\n    case of *codes* being None.\n    \n    Some behavior of Path objects can be controlled by rcParams. See the\n    rcParams whose keys start with 'path.'.\n    \n    .. note::\n    \n        The vertices and codes arrays should be treated as\n        immutable -- there are a number of optimizations and assumptions\n        made up front in the constructor that will not change when the\n        data changes.\n    \"\"\"\n\n\n",
