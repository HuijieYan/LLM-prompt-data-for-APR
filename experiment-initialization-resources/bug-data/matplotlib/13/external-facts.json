            "... in favor of the corresponding ones in path.py.\n(Strictly speaking, make_path_regular is closer to\ncleaned(remove_nans=False) but in practice cleaned() works equally\nwell.)\n\nNote that we may want to deprecate the STOP code, which is documented as \"not required and ignored\" but actually causes the rest of the path to be dropped silently; it gets appended by cleaned() and caused an earlier version of this PR to break (because the STOP would then cause the rest of the concatenated path to be dropped).\n\nPR Summary\nPR Checklist\n Has Pytest style unit tests\n Code is Flake 8 compliant\n New features are documented, with examples if plot related\n Documentation is sphinx and numpydoc compliant\n Added an entry to doc/users/next_whats_new/ if major new feature (follow instructions in README.rst there)\n Documented in doc/api/api_changes.rst if API changed in a backward-incompatible way\n"
