Description of your issue, suggested solution and other information
This issue occured when I was downloading a tutorial video about Bash that contained $PATH in the title. The video URL is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJMFxIbDe-g. When youtube-dl attempts to create the file with the video title to download into the $PATH string in the title actually gets replaced with the contents of the actual $PATH variable in my shell. As you can see by the line in the output showing the destination file this creates a huge mess of directories with the mistitled video sitting at the bottom of it. Videos containing $ are rare but it needs to be escaped, I'm happy to provide any additional information.

Please Note: While I respect the request for the whole output I removed the URL on the line "[debug] Invoking downloader on" as I know it is not relevant to the issue whatsoever but it contained informtion such as my IP address.
