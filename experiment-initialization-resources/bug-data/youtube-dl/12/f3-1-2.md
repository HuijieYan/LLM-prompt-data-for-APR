Description of your issue, suggested solution and other information
The previously valid format selection of (bestvideo+bestaudio/best)[ext!=webm] no longer is valid since yesterday's release. Removing the [ext!=webm] avoids the error and shows it was rejecting a video of mp4 video and m4a audio [link]. After commit 2cc779f, != looks like it should still be valid per the updated documentation.
