Description of your issue, suggested solution and other information
In version 2017.03.05, I can no longer download Twitch videos that are only available to subscribers. When I try, the program crashes after [twitch:vod] Logging in as (username):

  File "/usr/local/bin/youtube-dl/youtube_dl/utils.py", line 535, in sanitize_url
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'startswith'
This is a regression, not a change in Twitch's download page. I downloaded 2017.03.02 and verified that I can still download the same video with that version. Both verbose outputs are provided below.

I have an account that is subscribed to the channel required to view the VOD I am testing with. I'm happy to give my credentials to someone over email, just not to post them publicly on Github. Email me at stephen@stephenwade.me.

Verbose output (current version, failure)
Add -v flag to your command line you run youtube-dl with, copy the whole output and insert it here. It should look similar to one below (replace it with your log inserted between triple ```):
