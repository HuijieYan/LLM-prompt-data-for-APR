            "So that they can configure http handler. This is to fix #2628.\n\nDescription\n#2628 introduced dependency of prometheus_client and that breaks server.py. This PR\nadds a callback for the metrics collector to further customise http handler.\n\nMotivation and Context\nI'm not entirely sure exposing http handler to contrib is a good idea, but this is to avoid pulling\nin dependency or hardcoding a header value only for the sake of a certain metrics collector.\n"
