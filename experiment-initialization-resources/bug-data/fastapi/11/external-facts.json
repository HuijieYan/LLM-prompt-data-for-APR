            "Describe the bug\n\nThe Union type works as expected when response model is defined as such according to docs: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/extra-models/#union-or-anyof However when parameters (body payload) are defined as Union the code runs fine until executing method, and docs are picking up the types and generating schema correctly but the empty ValidationRequestError is thrown when route method is called even if there are all parameters sent are valid.\n\nTo Reproduce\n\nSample code to reproduce:\n\nclass SimpleData(BaseModel):\n    foo: Optional[str] = None\n\nclass ExtendedData(SimpleData):\n    bar: str # Note that this is required\n\nPostData = Union[ExtendedData, SimpleData]\n\n@router.post(\"/test\")\nasync def post(data: PostData):\n    return \"OK\"\nThen the POST /test route is called with a body payload:\n\n{\n    \"foo\": \"test1\",\n    \"bar\": \"test2\"\n}\nAs a result the empty ValidationRequestError is thrown with value_error.missing message but no actual field assigned to it.\n\nExpected behavior\nParameters from the request are resolved and parsed against the types inside Union.\n\nEnvironment:\n\nFastAPI Version: 0.29.0\n"
