Describe the bug
If an invalid condecimal is sent to a FastAPI service the service will return a 500 internal server error, instead of a 422 validation error. I can't reproduce this using Pydantic alone.

To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Run the attached condecimal-500-server.py file.
In a separate terminal run the attached condecimal-500-client.py file.
condecimal-500-server.log shows what you will see in the terminal that is running the server, most of the invalid requests will return a 422 but the one that violates the decimal constraint raises a TypeError.
condecimal-500-client.log shows what you will see in the terminal running the client, basically the same info that you see in the server's logs.
Run the attached condecimal-500-pydantic.py file.
condecimal-500-pydantic.log shows what you will see when running that file, Pydantic correctly raises a ValidationError when the constraint is violated indicating that this is not an bug in Pydantic.
Expected behavior
I expect a 422 response along with an explanation of what is invalid about the number to be returned, as happens when other invalid payloads are sent.

Environment:

OS: Linux
FastAPI Version: 0.44.0
Pydantic Version: 1.1.1
Python Version: 3.7.2
```
