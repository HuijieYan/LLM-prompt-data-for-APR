            "Describe the bug\nWebsocket routes appear to only work on the main FastAPI object, not on APIRouter objects. When the same function is copied from a FastAPI object to an APIRouter object instead of working properly it just throws a 403.\n\nTo Reproduce\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n\nThe following works as expected:\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI\napp = FastAPI()\n\n@app.websocket_route(\"/hello\")\nasync def hello(websocket):\n    await websocket.accept()\n    await websocket.send_text(\"Hello!\")\n    response = await websocket.receive_text()\n    print(response)\n    await websocket.close()\n    print(\"Closed\")\nMoving hello to an APIRouter fails:\n# main.py\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI\nimport other\napp = FastAPI()\napp.include_router(other.router)\n# other.py\nfrom fastapi import APIRouter\nrouter = APIRouter()\n\n@router.websocket_route(\"/routerhello\")\nasync def hello(websocket):\n    await websocket.accept()\n    await websocket.send_text(\"Router Hello!\")\n    response = await websocket.receive_text()\n    print(response)\n    await websocket.close()\n    print(\"Router Closed\")\nExpected behavior\nI expect a websocket route to work on both a FastAPI and APIRouter object.\n\nScreenshots\nNot applicable.\n\nEnvironment:\n\nOS: macOS 10.14.3\n\nFastAPI Version: 0.9.0\n\nPython version, get it with: 3.7.2\n\nAdditional context\nTesting websocket client side with websocat.\n"
