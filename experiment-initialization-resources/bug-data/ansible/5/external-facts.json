            "SUMMARY\nThe argument spec validation methods were moved out of basic.py in Ansible 2.8 to make them available for user outside of AnsibleModule. I got several of the unit tests written but not all of them. I'm mainly documenting this here so we can work on them during PyCon 2019 sprints.\n\n check_mutually_exclusive()\n check_required_one_of()\n check_required_together()\n check_required_by()\n check_required_arguments()\n check_required_if()\n fail_on_missing_params()\nISSUE TYPE\nFeature Idea\nCOMPONENT NAME\nlib/ansible/module_utils/common/validation.py\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nThere may be a bug in check _type_int() that needs fixing and updating the test. If an bool it returns a bool. This is because Python considers True and False integer_types. It seems wrong to me that check_type_int(False) returns False. This has been the behaviour of this method for quite some time, so changing this could have negative effects.\n"
