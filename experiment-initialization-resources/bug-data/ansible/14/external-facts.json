            "SUMMARY\nTonight many of my roles started failing CI tests, and after an hour or so I tracked down the problem to an old version of the geerlingguy.php role being installed. The current version on Galaxy (see https://galaxy.ansible.com/geerlingguy/php) is 3.7.0.\n\nBut Molecule was downloading the release prior to that, 3.6.3.\n\nI also tested manually installing the role (without specifying a version) on two other fresh environments\u2014in both cases, it still downloaded the old not-current version, 3.6.3.\n\nSo... either the Galaxy API and the Galaxy UI are out of sync, or something is wrong with Ansible's ansible-galaxy command, and it's causing older-than-latest versions of at least one role to be downloaded...\n\nISSUE TYPE\nBug Report\nCOMPONENT NAME\nansible-galaxy\n\nANSIBLE VERSION\nansible 2.9.0\n  config file = None\n  configured module search path = [u'/root/.ansible/plugins/modules', u'/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']\n  ansible python module location = /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible\n  executable location = /usr/local/bin/ansible\n  python version = 2.7.15+ (default, Oct  7 2019, 17:39:04) [GCC 7.4.0]\nCONFIGURATION\nN/A (no changes)\nOS / ENVIRONMENT\nUbuntu 18.04: fail (3.6.3)\nUbuntu 16.04: fail (3.6.3)\nDebian 10: fail (3.6.3)\nDebian 9: fail (3.6.3)\nDebian 8: success (3.7.0)\nCentOS 8: success (3.7.0)\nCentOS 7: fail (3.6.3)\nAnsible 2.9.0 was used in each environment, installed via Pip. Very weird. I even ran the test in a fresh new Debian 8 and CentOS 8 environment 3 times each, and it was successful every time. And I ran the other tests at least twice each and they failed every time... so it doesn't seem to be a cache-related issue in the API.\n\nSTEPS TO REPRODUCE\nansible-galaxy install geerlingguy.php\nEXPECTED RESULTS\nThe latest version of the role (3.7.0) should be installed.\n\nACTUAL RESULTS\nAn older version of the role (3.6.3) was installed.\n\nNote that the proper version was installed on CentOS 8 and Debian 8... but none of the other OSes I tested, all confirmed to be running Ansible 2.9.0, installed via Pip.\n"
