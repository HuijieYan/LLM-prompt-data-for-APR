By doing so, the role is not found. Replacing the collection_var_name with the collection name correctly i can use the role without issues.\n\nISSUE TYPE\nBug Report\nCOMPONENT NAME\nCollections\n\nANSIBLE VERSION\n\nansible 2.9.6\n  configured module search path = [u'/Users/alexandruvinogradov/.ansible/plugins/modules', u'/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']\n  ansible python module location = /Users/alexandruvinogradov/Library/Python/2.7/lib/python/site-packages/ansible\n  executable location = /usr/local/bin/ansible\n  python version = 2.7.16 (default, Jan 27 2020, 04:46:15) [GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 10.0.1 (clang-1001.0.37.14)]\n\nCONFIGURATION\nno modification\nOS / ENVIRONMENT\nMacOS Mojave 10.14.6\n\nSTEPS TO REPRODUCE\nUse the playbook below to try to execute role1 from a pre-created collection. Call the collection by passing the var collection_name to match the collection name.\nansible-playbook playbook.yml -e'{\"collection_name\":\"name\"}'\n\n---\n- hosts: all  \n  collections:\n   - namespace.{{ collection_name }}\n  tasks:\n    - import_role:\n        name: role1\nEXPECTED RESULTS\nThe expected behaviour would be that the role from the collection passed as variable gets executed. If i were to replace the variable in the playbook with the actual passed name, the role gets executed correctly.\n\nACTUAL RESULTS\nThe role is not recognized as part of the collection.\n\nERROR! the role 'role1' was not found\n\nThe error appears to be in 'playbook.yml': line 7, column 15, but may\nbe elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.\n\nThe offending line appears to be:\n\n    - import_role:\n        name: role1\n              ^ here\n```\n\n",
