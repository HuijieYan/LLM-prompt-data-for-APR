            "The current documentation on callbacks isn't showing bullet points correctly under the \"Arguments\" section of a few models. Here's the example for ModelCheckpoint:\n\nfilepath: string, path to save the model file. monitor: quantity to monitor. verbose: verbosity mode, 0 or 1. save_best_only: if save_best_only=True, the latest best model according to the quantity monitored will not be overwritten. mode: one of {auto, min, max}. If save_best_only=True, the decision to overwrite the current save file is made based on either the maximization or the minimization of the monitored quantity. For val_acc, this should be max, for val_loss this should be min, etc. In auto mode, the direction is automatically inferred from the name of the monitored quantity. save_weights_only: if True, then only the model's weights will be saved (model.save_weights(filepath)), else the full model is saved (model.save(filepath)). period: Interval (number of epochs) between checkpoints.\n\nLooking at the source code, the docstring seems to be organized correctly:\nkeras/keras/callbacks.py\n\nLines 371 to 390 in dc9e510\n\n     # Arguments \n         filepath: string, path to save the model file. \n         monitor: quantity to monitor. \n         verbose: verbosity mode, 0 or 1. \n         save_best_only: if `save_best_only=True`, \n             the latest best model according to \n             the quantity monitored will not be overwritten. \n         mode: one of {auto, min, max}. \n             If `save_best_only=True`, the decision \n             to overwrite the current save file is made \n             based on either the maximization or the \n             minimization of the monitored quantity. For `val_acc`, \n             this should be `max`, for `val_loss` this should \n             be `min`, etc. In `auto` mode, the direction is \n             automatically inferred from the name of the monitored quantity. \n         save_weights_only: if True, then only the model's weights will be \n             saved (`model.save_weights(filepath)`), else the full model \n             is saved (`model.save(filepath)`). \n         period: Interval (number of epochs) between checkpoints. \n     \"\"\" \nIt is however showing up correctly for other models, e.g. ProgbarLogger:\n\nArguments\ncount_mode: One of \"steps\" or \"samples\". Whether the progress bar should count samples seen or steps (batches) seen.\nstateful_metrics: Iterable of string names of metrics that should not be averaged over an epoch. Metrics in this list will be logged as-is. All others will be averaged over time (e.g. loss, etc).\n",
