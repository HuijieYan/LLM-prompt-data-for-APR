            "Hello, I am using CTC loss function in my model, everything were good until I tried to using online training (batch_size =1). The error was caused by K.ctc_batch_cost function.\nThe error can be reproduced with the keras example \"image_ocr.py\" by simply set the \"minibatch_size = 1 \" in line 446 ( the parameter of TextImagegenerator).\n\nI am using keras 2.0.2 with tensorflow 1.1.0 backend.\nThank you!\n"
