Summary
the default value(None) for param cache_dir in function get_file() is inconsistent with keras backend when 'KERAS_HOME' is not ~/.keras.
when we set KERAS_HOME and KERAS_HOME is not ~/.keras, models and datasets will still be in ~/.keras(when the cache_dir is default value) while the config file keras.json in KERAS_HOME.
The config file keras.json, models and datasets should be in the same folder by default

bug fix the unit test test_data_utils () in tests/keras/utils/data_utils_test.py where the cache_dir remain extracted-file test.txt(which should be removed at last) when untar is True
