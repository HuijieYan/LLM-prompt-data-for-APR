The value of\n        `states` should be a numpy array or list of numpy arrays representing\n        the initial state of the RNN layer.\n    \n    # Note on passing external constants to RNNs\n        You can pass \"external\" constants to the cell using the `constants`\n        keyword argument of `RNN.__call__` (as well as `RNN.call`) method. This\n        requires that the `cell.call` method accepts the same keyword argument\n        `constants`. Such constants can be used to condition the cell\n        transformation on additional static inputs (not changing over time),\n        a.k.a. an attention mechanism.\n    \n    # Examples\n    \n    ```python\n        # First, let's define a RNN Cell, as a layer subclass.\n    \n        class MinimalRNNCell(keras.layers.Layer):\n    \n            def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):\n                self.units = units\n                self.state_size = units\n                super(MinimalRNNCell, self).__init__(**kwargs)\n    \n            def build(self, input_shape):\n                self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),\n                                              initializer='uniform',\n                                              name='kernel')\n                self.recurrent_kernel = self.add_weight(\n                    shape=(self.units, self.units),\n                    initializer='uniform',\n                    name='recurrent_kernel')\n                self.built = True\n    \n            def call(self, inputs, states):\n                prev_output = states[0]\n                h = K.dot(inputs, self.kernel)\n                output = h + K.dot(prev_output, self.recurrent_kernel)\n                return output, [output]\n    \n        # Let's use this cell in a RNN layer:\n    \n        cell = MinimalRNNCell(32)\n        x = keras.Input((None, 5))\n        layer = RNN(cell)\n        y = layer(x)\n    \n        # Here's how to use the cell to build a stacked RNN:\n    \n        cells = [MinimalRNNCell(32), MinimalRNNCell(64)]\n        x = keras.Input((None, 5))\n        layer = RNN(cells)\n        y = layer(x)\n    ```\n    \"\"\"\n\n\n    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function\n    def states(self):\n        # Please ignore the body of this function\n\n    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function\n    def states(self, states):\n        # Please ignore the body of this function\n\n\n\n    # this is the buggy function you need to fix\n    def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):\n        if isinstance(input_shape, list):\n            input_shape = input_shape[0]\n    \n        if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):\n            output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]\n        else:\n            output_dim = self.cell.state_size\n    \n        if self.return_sequences:\n            output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)\n        else:\n            output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)\n    \n        if self.return_state:\n            state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in self.states]\n            return [output_shape] + state_shape\n        else:\n            return output_shape\n    \n"
