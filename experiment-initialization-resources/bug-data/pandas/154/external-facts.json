It's not mentioned in the documentation so either the timezone should be preserved or the documentation should mention that timezone is removed (by converting to UTC it seems).\n\nI had a quick look and couldn't find another issue for this. I glanced at the GroupBy shift implementation and my guess is that it's due to cython/numpy not supporting timezones.\n\nI'm happy to work on a fix if someone says what the preferred solution is.\n\nExpected Output\n0                         NaT\n1   2018-01-01 00:00:00-05:00\n2   2018-01-08 00:00:00-05:00\n3   2018-01-15 00:00:00-05:00\n4   2018-01-22 00:00:00-05:00\ndtype: datetime64[ns, America/New_York]\n"
