            "Code Sample\nIf we try to define a dataframe using a dictionary containing a set, we get:\n\npd.DataFrame({'a':{1,2,3}})\n\n       a\n0  {1, 2, 3}\n1  {1, 2, 3}\n2  {1, 2, 3}\nProblem description\nThe set is being replicated n times, n being the length of the actual set.\nWhile defining a column with a set directly might not make a lot of sense given that they are by definition unordered collections, the behaviour in any case seems clearly unexpected.\n\nExpected Output\nIn the case of a list, in order to obtain a single row containing a list, we would have to define a nested list, such as pd.DataFrame({'a':[[1,2,3]]}).\nSo similarly, with sets I would expect the same behaviour by defining the row with pd.DataFrame({'a':[{1,2,3}]}).\n\nIn the case of a single set, even if the order is not guaranteed to be preserved, I'd see more reasonable the same output that we would obtain with:\n\npd.DataFrame({'a':[1,2,3]})\n\n   a\n0  1\n1  2\n2  3\nSo:\n\npd.DataFrame({'a':{1,2,3}})\n\n   a\n0  1\n1  2\n2  3\nWhere:\n\npd.__version__\n# '1.0.0'\n"
