In the case of Daylight Saving Time switch, the frequency of the index should become None (since duplicated/missing timestamps are created).\n\nExpected Output\nAchievable with:\n\nnew_index = index.tz_localize(None)\nnew_index.freq = new_index.inferred_freq  # drop frequency if not inferrable\nprint(new_index)  # this is correct\nprint(new_index.freq)\n"
