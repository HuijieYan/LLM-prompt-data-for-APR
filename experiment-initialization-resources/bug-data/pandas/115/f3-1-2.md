The issue description is:

```text
# define a Series to be used with interpolation to fill the NaN value
s = pd.Series(data=[10, 9, np.nan, 2, 1], index=[10,9,3,2,1])
# 10    10
# 9      9
# 3    nan
# 2      2
# 1      1

s.interpolate(method='index')
# returns the following; a 1 is used to fill the NaN which was not expected
# 10   10
# 9     9
# 3     1
# 2     2
# 1     1

s.sort_index(ascending=True).interpolate(method='index')
# returns the following; a 3 is used to correctly fill the NaN
# 1     1
# 2     2
# 3     3
# 9     9
# 10   10
Problem description
When calling .interpolate(method='index') on a Series or DataFrame where the Index is not sorted with ascending=True I think a warning should be raised to alert the user that errors in the output could be possible.
