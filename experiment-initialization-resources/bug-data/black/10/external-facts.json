            "Operating system: Ubuntu 18.04\nPython version: 3.6.3\nBlack version: master\n\nThank you @ambv for this library. When trying to run this on a codebase that uses tabs, indentation for comments past depth 0 is changed incorrectly after a dedent. Sample input (NB tabs):\n\nif 1:\n\tif 2:\n\t\tpass\n\t# This comment should be indented the same as the next line\n\tpass\nBlack reformats this to:\n\nif 1:\n    if 2:\n        pass\n        # This comment should be indented the same as the next line\n    pass\nNote that this only happens when the input file uses tabs.\n"
