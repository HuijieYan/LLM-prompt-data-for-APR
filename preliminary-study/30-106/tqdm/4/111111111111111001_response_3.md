The error message suggests that the issue occurs when attempting to multiply the `total` variable by the `unit_scale` variable. This occurs in the following section of the code:

```python
# apply custom scale if necessary
if unit_scale and unit_scale not in (True, 1):
    total *= unit_scale
    # rest of the code...
```

The error message specifically states: "TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *=: 'NoneType' and 'int'." This means that the `total` variable is of type `NoneType`, which is not compatible with the multiplication operation.

The reason behind the bug is that the `total` variable is being set to `None` in the following section of the code:

```python
# sanity check: total
if total and n > total:
    total = None
```

By setting `total` to `None`, the subsequent multiplication operation causes the TypeError.

To fix this bug, a possible approach is to reassign the scaled value of `total` to a new variable, rather than directly modifying `total`. This can be done by introducing a new variable, such as `scaled_total`, and storing the scaled value in it.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_meter` function:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    
    # sanity check: total
    if total and n > total:
        total = None

    scaled_total = total  # Store the original total value
    # apply custom scale if necessary
    if unit_scale and unit_scale not in (True, 1):
        scaled_total *= unit_scale  # Scale the total

    # rest of the code...
```

By introducing a new variable `scaled_total`, we avoid directly modifying the `total` variable and prevent the TypeError.
