The error occurs when the program tries to multiply the `total` (which is of type `NoneType`) by `unit_scale`, which is of type `int` in the `format_meter` function. This multiplication operation is not supported for `NoneType` and `int`, hence resulting in a TypeError.

To fix this, we can initialize a new variable called `scaled_total` and set it to `total` multiplied by `unit_scale` only if both `unit_scale` and `total` are not None. If either `unit_scale` or `total` is None, then `scaled_total` should be set to `None`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic `format_meter` function:

```python
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                     unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                     postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
        # initialize scaled_total
        scaled_total = None
        if unit_scale and total is not None:
            scaled_total = total * unit_scale

        # sanity check: total
        if total and n > total:
            total = None

        # apply custom scale if necessary
        if unit_scale and unit_scale not in (True, 1) and scaled_total is not None:
            total = scaled_total
            n *= unit_scale
            if rate:
                rate *= unit_scale  # by default rate = 1 / self.avg_time
            unit_scale = False

        # remaining code remains the same
```

With this corrected code, the multiplication operation will only be performed if both `unit_scale` and `total` are not None, preventing the TypeError from occurring.
