The error is occurring in the line `total *= unit_scale` within the `format_meter` function. The reason for the bug is that the `total` variable might be `None` when the function reaches this line. This is in line with the error message that states "unsupported operand type(s) for *=: 'NoneType' and 'int'".

One possible approach to fix the bug is to introduce a condition to handle the case where `total` is `None`. If `total` is `None`, then the function should not perform the multiplication operation and just keep `total` as `None`.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_meter` function:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    """
    Return a string-based progress bar given some parameters
    ... (rest of the function remains the same)...
    """
    
    # sanity check: total
    if total and n > total:
        total = None
    
    # apply custom scale if necessary
    if total is not None:  # check if total is not None
        if unit_scale and unit_scale not in (True, 1):
            total *= unit_scale
            n *= unit_scale
            if rate:
                rate *= unit_scale  # by default rate = 1 / self.avg_time
            unit_scale = False
    
    # rest of the function remains the same
```

This modification ensures that the multiplication operation is only performed when `total` is not `None`.
