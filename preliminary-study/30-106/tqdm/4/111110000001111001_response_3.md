The bug is likely arising from the conditional statement:
```python
# sanity check: total
if total and n > total:
    total = None
```
This condition is problematic because it sets `total` to `None` when `total` is non-zero and `n` is greater than `total`. However, if `total` is non-zero, it should not be set to `None`, as this affects calculations later in the code.

To fix this bug, the `total` should only be set to `None` if it is zero. If `total` is non-zero and `n` is greater than `total`, it's more appropriate to set `n` to `total` in this case to avoid any inconsistency in the calculation.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    """
    Return a string-based progress bar given some parameters
    ... (remaining code remains the same) ...
    """

    # validate total and n
    if total == 0:
        total = None
    elif n > total:
        n = total

    # remaining code remains the same
```

By making these adjustments, the function should handle the `total` and `n` values more accurately and prevent the bug scenario from occurring.
