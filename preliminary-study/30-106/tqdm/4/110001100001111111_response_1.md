The bug occurs in the `format_meter` method due to the incorrect calculation of the `rate` variable, which is the manual override for iteration rate. When the `rate` value is calculated using `n / elapsed`, it does not account for the unit scale factor, resulting in incorrect `rate` and `inv_rate` values. This causes further incorrect calculations of the formatted rates `rate_noinv_fmt` and `rate_inv_fmt`.

To fix this bug, the `rate` calculation should take into account the `unit_scale` factor by multiplying `n` and `elapsed` with `unit_scale` when `unit_scale` is not equal to `True` or `1`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    """
    Return a string-based progress bar given some parameters
    ... (parameters documentation remains the same) ...
    """
    
    # sanity check: total
    if total and n > total:
        total = None
    
    # apply custom scale if necessary
    if unit_scale and unit_scale not in (True, 1):
        total *= unit_scale
        n *= unit_scale
        if rate:
            rate *= unit_scale  # by default rate = 1 / self.avg_time
        unit_scale = False
    
    format_interval = tqdm.format_interval
    elapsed_str = format_interval(elapsed)

    # if unspecified, attempt to use rate = average speed
    # (we allow manual override since predicting time is an arcane art)
    if rate is None and elapsed:
        rate = n / elapsed
    inv_rate = 1 / rate if rate else None

    # Rest of the code remains the same
```

In the corrected code, the `unit_scale` factor is applied to adjust the `n`, `total`, and `rate` values before further calculations, ensuring that the unit scaling factor is considered in the rate calculation and subsequent formatted rate values.
