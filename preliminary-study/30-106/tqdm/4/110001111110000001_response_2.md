The error occurs because the variable `total` is initially set to `None`, and then there's an attempted multiplication operation (`total *= unit_scale`) within the `format_meter` method of the `tqdm` class. This causes a `TypeError` because `None` cannot be multiplied by an integer.

To fix this issue, the `total` variable should be checked for `None` before performing any arithmetic operations on it. If it's `None`, then the multiplication operation should be skipped.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_meter` method:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    """
    Return a string-based progress bar given some parameters
    ...
    """

    # sanity check: total
    if total and n > total:
        total = None

    if total is not None:  # Check if total is not None before performing arithmetic operations
        # apply custom scale if necessary
        if unit_scale and unit_scale not in (True, 1):
            total *= unit_scale
            n *= unit_scale
            if rate:
                rate *= unit_scale  # by default rate = 1 / self.avg_time
            unit_scale = False

    format_interval = tqdm.format_interval
    elapsed_str = format_interval(elapsed)

    # the rest of the method remains unchanged
    ...
```

With this correction, the `TypeError` should no longer occur.
