The error occurs in the `format_meter` method when it tries to multiply `total` by `unit_scale`. The error message indicates that it's attempting to multiply a `NoneType` and an `int`, which is causing a `TypeError`.

This error occurs because in the line `total = None` when the sanity check for total fails, and then later in the code, `total` is attempted to be multiplied by `unit_scale`, which is an int. The `total` should not be set to `None` as it causes issues in the subsequent calculations.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `total` is set to `None` differently, as it should not be involved in further calculations.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_meter` method:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):

    # sanity check: total
    if total is not None and n > total:  # Check if total is not None
        total = None

    # rest of the code remains the same
```

By making this change, we avoid setting `total` to `None` if it's meaningful and avoid the multiplication error that occurs later in the code.
