The error message indicates that the error occurs when the `total` variable is multiplied by `unit_scale` in the `format_meter` function. The error message states, "TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *=: 'NoneType' and 'int'".

The potential error location is the line `total *= unit_scale` in the `format_meter` function.

The error occurred because the `total` variable might be None due to the condition `if total and n > total:`. This would result in a TypeError when attempting to multiply `None` with an integer.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `total` is None. We can use an `if` statement to check whether `total` is not None before performing the multiplication.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    """
    Return a string-based progress bar given some parameters
    
    ... (other parameter documentation) ...
    """

    # sanity check: total
    if total and n > total:
        total = None

    if total is not None:  # Handle case where total is not None
        # apply custom scale if necessary
        if unit_scale and unit_scale not in (True, 1):
            total *= unit_scale
            n *= unit_scale
            if rate:
                rate *= unit_scale
            unit_scale = False

    # ... (rest of the function remains the same) ...
```

In this corrected code, we added a check for `total is not None` before performing the multiplication. If total is not None, then we continue with the custom scale calculation.
