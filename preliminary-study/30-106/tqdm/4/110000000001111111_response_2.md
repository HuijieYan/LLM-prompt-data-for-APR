Error location:
The error is likely occurring due to the incorrect calculation of the `rate` variable, which is used for the calculation of the `rate_fmt` variable and other subsequent operations involving rates and timings. In the buggy code, the `rate` is calculated based on the variable `unit_scale`, which may not be functioning correctly in certain scenarios.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect application of `unit_scale` when calculating the `rate`. In the given test case, specifically, the variable `unit_scale` is set to `10`, and it is used to scale the `total`, `n`, and `rate` in the buggy function. However, the scaling operation is not correctly implemented, leading to inaccurate rates and timings.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the `unit_scale` is applied correctly to the `total`, `n`, and `rate` variables, accounting for their respective scales as per the `unit_scale` value.
2. Verify that the calculation of the `rate` is accurate and takes into consideration the scaling factor introduced by `unit_scale`.
3. Consider refactoring the logic related to the calculation of rates and timings, ensuring that the scaling factor is appropriately handled.

Corrected code:

```python
from tqdm import tqdm

@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    """
    Return a string-based progress bar given some parameters

    ... # rest of the parameters and docstring unchanged

    Returns
    -------
    out  : Formatted meter and stats, ready to display.
    """

    # Original code for the function will be partially modified here
    rate = n / elapsed if elapsed else None  # Updated calculation of rate

    # The rest of the code remains the same
    ...  # rest of the function body
```
