The error occurs because the `total` value is being multiplied by `unit_scale` before checking if it's None. This leads to a TypeError when the `total` value is None.

To fix this bug, we need to perform a check on the `total` value before using it in any arithmetic operations.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_meter` function:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    """
    Return a string-based progress bar given some parameters

    ... (function documentation and parameters)

    Returns
    -------
    out  : Formatted meter and stats, ready to display.
    """

    if total is not None and n > total:
        total = None

    # rest of the function remains the same
```

By adding the check `if total is not None and n > total`, we ensure that the `total` value is not None before using it in any arithmetic operations.

This change will prevent the TypeError and ensure that the arithmetic operations are only performed when the `total` value is not None.
