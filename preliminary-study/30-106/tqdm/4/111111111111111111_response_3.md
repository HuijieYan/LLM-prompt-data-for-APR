The error occurs because the `total` variable is being re-assigned within the function, regardless of whether it is already assigned a value. In the test case, the `total` variable is initially set to None and then an attempt is made to multiply it by `unit_scale`, which leads to a TypeError.

To fix the bug, the function should only perform the multiplication if `total` has a valid value. This can be achieved by adding a conditional check to ensure that `total` is not None before performing the multiplication.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_meter` function:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    """
    Return a string-based progress bar given some parameters
    ...
    """

    # sanity check: total
    if total is not None and n > total:
        total = None
    elif total is not None and unit_scale and unit_scale not in (True, 1):
        total *= unit_scale

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With this conditional check, the function will only attempt to multiply `total` by `unit_scale` if `total` is not None.

This correction should prevent the TypeError from occurring and handle the multiplication appropriately.
