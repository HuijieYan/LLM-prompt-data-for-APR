Based on the input and the variable runtime values, it seems that the buggy function is not performing the expected calculations and formatting as described in the comments.

The potential error location appears to be in the `format_meter` function within the if-else conditions and the formatting of the progress bar. The calculations based on the input parameters are not accurately reflected in the returned values.

The bug occurred because the calculations and conditions are not correctly implemented. The function's logic needs to be adjusted to accurately calculate the progress and format the progress bar based on the input parameters.

To fix this bug, the logic for calculating the progress rate, progress bar, and progress statistics needs to be updated to accurately reflect the input parameters and their relationships.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    """
    Return a string-based progress bar given some parameters

    Parameters
    ----------
    ... (same parameters as before)

    Returns
    -------
    out  : Formatted meter and stats, ready to display.
    """

    # Calculate the progression percentage
    percentage = (n / total) * 100 if total else 0

    # Format elapsed time
    elapsed_str = '{:0.2f}'.format(elapsed)

    # Update the rate and format it
    rate = n / elapsed if elapsed else 0
    rate_fmt = '{:.2f}{}s/{}'.format(rate, unit, unit) if rate else '?'
    
    # Format the progress bar and stats
    if total:
        remaining = (n - total) / (rate if rate != 0 else 1)
        remaining_str = '{:0.2f}'.format(remaining)

        progress_bar = '{}%|{} {} <{}, {}{}{}'.format(
            percentage, n, total, elapsed_str, remaining_str, rate_fmt, 
            postfix if postfix else ''
        )

        return progress_bar
    else:
        # In case there's no total, return the basic stats
        return '{}{} [{}, {}{}]'.format(
            n, unit, elapsed_str, rate_fmt, postfix if postfix else ''
        )
```

In the corrected code, the logic for calculating the progression percentage, elapsed time, and iteration rate has been updated. The progress bar and stats are formatted based on these calculations and the specified input parameters. The corrected code should now accurately calculate and format the progress bar and statistics.
