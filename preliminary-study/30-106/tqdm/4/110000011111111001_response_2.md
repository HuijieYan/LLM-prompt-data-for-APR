The error in the function is occurring due to the multiplication operation `total *= unit_scale` where `total` is of NoneType. This is happening when the unit_scale is provided as 10, which causes the function to multiply None with 10 and results in a TypeError.

To fix this issue, we can modify the function to handle the case when total is None. We can also remove the multiplication operation if total is None. 

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    """
    Return a string-based progress bar given some parameters
    """

    # sanity check: total
    if total and n > total:
        total = None

    if total:
        if unit_scale and unit_scale not in (True, 1):
            total *= unit_scale
            n *= unit_scale
            if rate:
                rate *= unit_scale  # by default rate = 1 / self.avg_time
        unit_scale = False
    else:
        unit_scale = False

    format_interval = tqdm.format_interval
    elapsed_str = format_interval(elapsed)

    # remaining code remains the same

    # return formatted meter and stats, ready to display
```
