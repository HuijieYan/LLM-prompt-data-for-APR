The error occurred when the `total` value is `None` and it tries to perform a multiplication operation on it. This is not allowed because `None` is not a valid operand for multiplication.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `total` is `None` before performing any operations with it. We can simply assign a default value of 0 to `total` if it is `None`, ensuring that it is a valid operand for arithmetic operations.

Here's the corrected code for the `@staticmethod` function `format_meter`:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    if total is None:
        total = 0

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```
In this correction, we added a simple condition to check if `total` is `None`, and if so, we assign a default value of 0 to it. This resolves the issue of performing operations with `None` as an operand.
