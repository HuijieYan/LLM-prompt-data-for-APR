Potential error location: The main issue in the code is the use of the `@staticmethod` decorator, which is not necessary in this context and is causing the code to fail.

Reasons behind the bug: The `@staticmethod` is used to define a static method, which does not have access to `self` or any other class attributes. However, in the provided code, `self` is being used in the function, indicating that it is not a static method. This results in a failure when the function is called.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Remove the `@staticmethod` decorator from the function definition since it is not needed for this function.

Corrected code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/tqdm_4/tqdm/_tqdm.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def format_sizeof(num, suffix='', divisor=1000):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def format_interval(t):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def format_dict(self):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# Corrected and updated function without the @staticmethod decorator
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    """
    Return a string-based progress bar given some parameters
    ...
    """
    # existing code for the format_meter function...
