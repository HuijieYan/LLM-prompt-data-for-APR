The error occurs when the `unit_scale` parameter is used to multiply the `total` variable, which results in a TypeError because `total` is None. This situation arises because the function erroneously applies the `unit_scale` to `total` without checking if `total` is not None. As a result, the function encounters a TypeError when trying to multiply None with an integer value.

To fix the bug, the function `format_meter` should only apply the custom scale to `n` and `total` if `unit_scale` is True and `total` is not None.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_meter` function:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    # sanity check: total
    if total and n > total:
        total = None

    # apply custom scale if necessary
    if unit_scale is True and total is not None:  # Check if unit_scale is True and total is not None
        total *= unit_scale
        n *= unit_scale
        if rate:
            rate *= unit_scale  # by default rate = 1 / self.avg_time
    unit_scale = False

    # code ...
```

With this correction, the function checks if `unit_scale` is True and if `total` is not None before applying the custom scale. If these conditions are met, the custom scale is applied to `total` and `n`.

This modification ensures that the function will not encounter a TypeError when `total` is None, thereby resolving the bug.
