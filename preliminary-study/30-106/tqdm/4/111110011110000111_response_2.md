The error occurs during the test case when the `format_meter` function tries to multiply `total` by `unit_scale` in the following line:

```python
total *= unit_scale
```

The error message indicates a TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *=: 'NoneType' and 'int', which means that `total` is of type None and it cannot be multiplied by an integer.

The reason behind this bug is that the `total` variable is not being handled properly when it is None. The function should check if `total` is None and handle it accordingly.

One approach to fix this bug is to add a condition to check if `total` is not None before performing the multiplication.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_meter` function:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    """
    Return a string-based progress bar given some parameters

    ... (other parameters and docstring)

    Returns
    -------
    out  : Formatted meter and stats, ready to display.
    """

    # sanity check: total
    if total is not None and n > total:
        total = None

    # apply custom scale if necessary
    if unit_scale and unit_scale not in (True, 1):
        if total is not None:
            total *= unit_scale
        n *= unit_scale
        if rate:
            rate *= unit_scale  # by default rate = 1 / self.avg_time
        unit_scale = False

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

This corrected code checks if `total` is not None before performing the multiplication to handle the NoneType error.
