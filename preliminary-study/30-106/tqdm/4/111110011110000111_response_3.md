The error message is indicating a TypeError which occurs at the line `total *= unit_scale` in the `format_meter` method of the `tqdm` class. This suggests that the `total` value may be None at runtime, resulting in a TypeError when trying to perform the multiplication operation.

The potential error location is within the conditional block that applies custom scale if necessary, specifically the line `total *= unit_scale`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code incorrectly assumes that `total` will always have a value, but in this particular test case, `total` is None.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to update the code to only apply the custom scale if `total` is not None. If `total` is None, then do not perform the multiplication operation.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
# this is the corrected code for the buggy function
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    """
    Return a string-based progress bar given some parameters
    """
    if total and n > total:
        total = None

    if total is not None and unit_scale and unit_scale not in (True, 1):
        total *= unit_scale
        n *= unit_scale
        if rate:
            rate *= unit_scale

    # ... remaining code (unchanged)
```

In the corrected code, we first check if `total` is not None before applying the custom scale, and only if it's not None, we perform the necessary operations. This should prevent the TypeError that was occurring in the original buggy code.
