The error message indicates a `TypeError` occurring due to an unsupported operand type(s) for the operation `total *= unit_scale`. This error occurs because in the buggy function, `total` is initially assigned as `None` and then an operation of multiplication is being performed on it.

The existing code does not handle the case where `total` is `None`. To fix this, we can add a conditional check to ensure that if `total` is `None`, then the multiplication operation should not be performed.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    if total and n > total:
        total = None  # sanity check: total

    if total is not None:  # Check if total is not None
        if unit_scale and unit_scale not in (True, 1):
            total *= unit_scale
            n *= unit_scale
            if rate:
                rate *= unit_scale  # by default rate = 1 / self.avg_time
            unit_scale = False

    # ... Rest of the code remains unchanged
```

By adding the conditional check for the `total` variable, we can avoid the `TypeError` that was occurring and ensure that the multiplication operation is only performed when `total` is not `None`.
