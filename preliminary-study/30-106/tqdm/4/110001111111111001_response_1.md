The error occurs in the Buggy case 1 of the provided function. The error is a TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *=: 'NoneType' and 'int'. This error occurs because the variable total is being assigned a value of None, and then the code tries to execute the operation total *= unit_scale, which is not supported for NoneType and int.

The issue lies in the portion of code where total is calculated and modified based on the unit_scale.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the total value is not None before performing any arithmetic operations on it.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    """
    Return a string-based progress bar given some parameters
    ...
    """
    
    if total is not None:  # Check if total is not None
        total *= unit_scale  # Modify total value based on unit_scale

    # Rest of the function code remains unchanged
```

By adding the check for total not being None before performing any arithmetic operations, we can ensure that the TypeError mentioned in the error message is resolved.

This corrected code will handle the total value appropriately and prevent any arithmetic operations on a NoneType.
