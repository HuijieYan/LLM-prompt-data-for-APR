The test case is attempting to run the `tqdm` function with a specified number of iterations but no total length. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the multiplication operation involving the `total` variable, which is of type `None`, and the `unit_scale` variable, which is of type `int`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is identified in the following section:

```python
# apply custom scale if necessary
if unit_scale and unit_scale not in (True, 1):
    total *= unit_scale
    n *= unit_scale
    if rate:
        rate *= unit_scale  # by default rate = 1 / self.avg_time
    unit_scale = False
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that when `total` is `None`, the multiplication operation `total *= unit_scale` will raise a `TypeError` because `None` is not a valid operand for the multiplication operation.

To fix this bug, we can modify the code to handle the case where `total` is `None` separately and avoid the multiplication operation. We can achieve this by using an `if` statement to check if `total` is not `None` before performing the multiplication operation.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    """
    Return a string-based progress bar given some parameters
    ...
    """

    # sanity check: total
    if total is not None and n > total:
        total = None

    # apply custom scale if necessary
    if unit_scale and unit_scale not in (True, 1) and total is not None:
        total *= unit_scale
        n *= unit_scale
        if rate:
            rate *= unit_scale  # by default rate = 1 / self.avg_time
        unit_scale = False

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    ...

    return l_bar + full_bar + r_bar
```

In the corrected code, we added a condition `if total is not None` before performing the multiplication operation with `total`, ensuring that the multiplication is only applied when `total` is not `None`.
