It seems that the bug occurs in the `format_meter` method of the `tqdm/_tqdm.py` file. The error message indicates a `TypeError` when trying to multiply `total` by `unit_scale`.

The reason behind this bug is that the `total` variable might have a value of `None` in the case where `n > total`, and then when the `unit_scale` is applied, it tries to multiply `total` (which is `None`) by `unit_scale`, resulting in a `TypeError`.

One possible approach to fixing this bug is to add a check for `total` being `None` before applying the `unit_scale`. If `total` is `None`, then there's no need to apply the `unit_scale`.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_meter` method:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    """
    Return a string-based progress bar given some parameters

    ... (rest of the docstring remains the same) ...

    """
    
    # sanity check: total
    if total and n > total:
        total = None
    
    # apply custom scale if necessary
    if total and unit_scale and unit_scale not in (True, 1):
        total *= unit_scale
        n *= unit_scale
        if rate:
            rate *= unit_scale  # by default rate = 1 / self.avg_time
        unit_scale = False
    
    # ... (rest of the function remains the same) ...
```

With this correction, the function will first check if `total` is not `None` before trying to apply the `unit_scale`. If `total` is `None`, then the `unit_scale` won't be applied, avoiding the `TypeError`.
