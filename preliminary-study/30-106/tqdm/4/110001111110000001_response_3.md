After analyzing the error message and the test case, it appears that the specific error is occurring at the line `total *= unit_scale`. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to unsupported operand types for the `*=` operation.

The reason behind the occurrence of this bug is that `total` is being set to `None` in the sanity check when `total and n > total` condition is met. Later in the code, when applying custom scale if necessary, the `*= unit_scale` operation is attempted on the `None` type.

To fix this bug, we need to refactor the code to prevent the assignment of `None` to `total` in the sanity check if it is used in the subsequent calculations. We can do this by introducing a new variable to handle the scaled total value while keeping the original `total` intact.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    """
    Return a string-based progress bar given some parameters

    # ... (rest of the docstring remains the same) ...

    Returns
    -------
    out  : Formatted meter and stats, ready to display.
    """

    scaled_total = total  # New variable to handle scaled total

    # sanity check: total
    if total and n > total:
        scaled_total = None  # Use a new variable for scaled total if the original total is None

    # apply custom scale if necessary
    if unit_scale and unit_scale not in (True, 1):
        scaled_total *= unit_scale
        n *= unit_scale
        if rate:
            rate *= unit_scale  # by default rate = 1 / self.avg_time
        unit_scale = False

    # rest of the function remains the same, using scaled_total instead of total in relevant calculations
```

By introducing a new variable `scaled_total` to handle the scaled total value, we prevent the original `total` from being set to `None` in the subsequent calculations, resolving the `TypeError` issue.
