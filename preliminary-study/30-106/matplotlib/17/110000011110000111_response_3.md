The error message indicates that there is an overflow encountered in the scalar subtract and absolute function calls within the `nonsingular` function. The problematic line seems to be where the `maxabsvalue` is calculated using the `abs` function.

The cause of the overflow may be due to using integer values for `vmin` and `vmax` in the test case, which may result in large values for `abs(vmin)` and `abs(vmax)`, causing an overflow when used with the `max` function. The `tiny` parameter also seems to be very small, which can exacerbate the issue.

To fix the issue, we can modify the `nonsingular` function to ensure that it handles integer values correctly and avoids overflow. We can use floating-point values for calculations and consider the case when the input values are integers.

Below is the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander
    
    vmin = float(vmin)  # Convert to float
    vmax = float(vmax)  # Convert to float

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True
    
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if int(vmax) == 0 and int(vmin) == 0:  # Check for integer input values
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected code, we explicitly convert `vmin` and `vmax` to floating-point values. Additionally, we check for integer values of `vmin` and `vmax` before performing calculations to handle the potential overflow. These modifications should resolve the overflow issues observed in the test cases.
