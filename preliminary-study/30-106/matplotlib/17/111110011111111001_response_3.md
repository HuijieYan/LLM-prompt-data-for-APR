The error message indicates that there is a "RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar subtract" in the `nonsingular` function. The error is occurring when `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` is being evaluated.

The reason for the error is that the `vmin` and `vmax` variables have very large values and the subtraction operation in `vmax - vmin` is resulting in an overflow.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `nonsingular` function to handle large values of `vmin` and `vmax` more efficiently.

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    # Check for infinite values and return expanded endpoints if found
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)) or (vmin == vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    # Swap vmin and vmax if necessary
    if increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        return -expander, expander
    elif (vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if abs(vmax + vmin) < tiny:
            return -expander, expander
        vmin = vmax - (vmax - vmin) * (1 + expander)
        vmax = vmax + (vmax - vmin) * expander

    if not increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

The changes made include:
1. Handling cases where `vmin` and `vmax` are infinite, equal, or have a very small difference.
2. Avoiding the overflow error by using an alternative approach for expanding the endpoints.

Test the new function with the problematic test cases to confirm that it resolves the overflow issue.
