The error message indicates a "RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar subtract" and "RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar absolute". This suggests that there is a potential overflow occurring when performing arithmetic operations in the function `nonsingular`.

Upon examining the function, it appears that the bug may be related to the calculations involving `maxabsvalue` and the comparisons involving `tiny`. The use of `np.finfo(float).tiny` may not be appropriate for the comparisons given the input values.

The bug is likely occurring due to numeric overflow when dealing with the data types involved in the calculations, particularly when operating on values close to the limits of int16. To fix this, we can revise the conditional checks and calculations to avoid these potential overflow scenarios.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    delta = vmax - vmin
    if maxabsvalue < tiny or delta <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if np.isclose(vmax, 0) and np.isclose(vmin, 0):
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

In this corrected version:
- We use `np.isclose` to compare `vmax` and `vmin` with 0 to avoid the issue with comparing floating point numbers close to zero.
- We store the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` in a separate variable `delta` to avoid any potential overflow in the comparison.
- We check the conditions carefully to prevent any overflow issues and revise the calculations accordingly.
