The error `RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar subtract` and `RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar absolute` suggests that there is an overflow occurring during the subtraction and absolute value calculation in the `nonsingular` function at these lines:

```python
elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
```

and

```python
maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
```

The reason behind this bug is that the values of `vmin` and `vmax` are too large, causing an overflow when subtracting or taking the absolute value.

To fix this bug, we can update the `nonsingular` function to handle large values by using NumPy's built-in functions which are designed to handle such scenarios.

Here's the corrected `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ... (same as before)

    Returns
    ... (same as before)
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = np.maximum(np.abs(vmin), np.abs(vmax))  # Using numpy's maximum and absolute functions

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*np.abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*np.abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

By using NumPy's `maximum` and `abs` functions, we ensure that the calculations are handled properly, even for large values, preventing the overflow encountered in the original code.
