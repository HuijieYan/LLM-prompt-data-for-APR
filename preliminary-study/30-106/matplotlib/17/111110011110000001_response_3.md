The error message indicates that a RuntimeWarning is being raised during the execution of the matplotlib test function. The warning specifically mentions that an overflow was encountered in the 'scalar subtract' and 'scalar absolute' operations within the 'nonsingular' function in the 'mtransforms' module. This points to a problem with the 'maxabsvalue' calculation and the subsequent operations involving 'vmin' and 'vmax' in the 'nonsingular' function.

Upon analyzing the 'nonsingular' function, it appears that the calculation of 'maxabsvalue' might be problematic, especially when dealing with large values. This leads to potential overflow issues and the generation of the RuntimeWarning.

To address this issue, the 'maxabsvalue' calculation should be performed in a way that prevents overflow. One approach could be to use numpy's absolute function directly to calculate the absolute values of 'vmin' and 'vmax', ensuring that it can handle a wider range of values without encountering overflow.

Here's the corrected 'nonsingular' function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    abs_vmin = np.abs(vmin)  # calculate absolute value using numpy's abs function
    abs_vmax = np.abs(vmax)  # calculate absolute value using numpy's abs function
    maxabsvalue = max(abs_vmin, abs_vmax)  # use the absolute values to calculate maxabsvalue

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
``` 

In this corrected version, the absolute values of 'vmin' and 'vmax' are calculated using numpy's abs function. Then, these absolute values are used to determine the 'maxabsvalue', which helps avoid potential overflow issues during calculations.
