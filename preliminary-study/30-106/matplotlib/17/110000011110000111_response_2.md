The error messages suggest that there are potential issues with numerical overflow and underflow in the `nonsingular` function. Specifically, the `RuntimeWarning` messages about overflow encountered during scalar subtract and scalar absolute operations indicate that the input values vmin and vmax are causing numerical instability due to their magnitude.

The bug occurs due to the comparison and manipulation of `vmin` and `vmax` without considering their absolute magnitude relative to `tiny` and `expander`. This can lead to unintended consequences such as overflow or underflow when performing arithmetic operations with these values.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison and manipulation of `vmin` and `vmax` take into account their absolute magnitude relative to `tiny` and `expander`. It's also important to handle cases where `vmin` or `vmax` are infinite or NaN, as well as cases where both inputs are 0 or very close to zero.

The following is the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not (np.isfinite(vmin) and np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander
    
    if vmin == 0 and vmax == 0:
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmin > vmax and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        return -expander, expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
        vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

In the updated code, I made the following changes:
1. Handled cases where `vmin` or `vmax` are infinite or NaN, as well as cases where both inputs are 0 or very close to zero.
2. Updated the comparison and manipulation of `vmin` and `vmax` to take into account their absolute magnitude relative to `tiny` and `expander`.
3. Simplified the logic for swapping `vmin` and `vmax` when necessary.

This corrected code should address the numerical instability and potential overflow/underflow issues in the `nonsingular` function.
