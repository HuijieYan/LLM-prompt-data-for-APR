The potential error location within the `nonsingular` function is in the section where the calculation for expanding the interval is being processed. The condition `maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny` is susceptible to numerical errors, and the subsequent block for expanding the interval may not guarantee that the singularities are properly avoided.

The bug occurs because when the interval is very small, the calculation for expanding the interval based on the `maxabsvalue` and `tiny` may not be accurate, leading to numerical instability. This can result in incorrect endpoints for the range, which does not effectively avoid singularities.

To fix this bug, one approach is to modify the logic for expanding the interval in the function. Instead of relying solely on the current calculation method, it would be more reliable to directly check if the interval is too small and then apply a suitable expansion to ensure that singularities are avoided.

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    if vmax - vmin <= tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vrange = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
            vmin -= expander * vrange
            vmax += expander * vrange

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected code, the condition for expanding the interval checks directly if the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is smaller than `tiny`. If this condition is met, the interval is expanded based on the maximum absolute value of endpoints, rather than relying on a potentially numerically unstable calculation. This approach ensures that the endpoints are correctly adjusted to avoid singularities.
