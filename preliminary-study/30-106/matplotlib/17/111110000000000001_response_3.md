Potential error location: 

The potential error location in the code is the use of the 'np' library without importing it. The code uses np.isfinite and np.finfo without importing numpy, which will result in a NameError when trying to call these functions.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: 

The bug occurs because the code is using functions from the 'np' library without actually importing it. This results in a NameError because the interpreter does not recognize np as a valid namespace for these functions.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

The bug can be fixed by importing the numpy library at the beginning of the file. This can be done by adding the line "import numpy as np" at the top of the file, before the definition of the nonsingular function.

Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
