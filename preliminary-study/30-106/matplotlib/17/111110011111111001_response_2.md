The bug occurs in the `nonsingular` function, as it tries to handle singular points, such as when the range is too small or when there is a risk of overflow. The function is designed to modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

In this case, the error message indicates a "RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar subtract." This suggests that when the `vmax - vmin` value is calculated, it may result in an overflow due to the large difference between `vmin` and `vmax`. Similarly, there is a "RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar absolute" which suggests that calculating the absolute value of excessively large numbers is causing an overflow.

To fix this bug, one approach might be to avoid operations that result in potential overflow when working with very large or very small numbers. Additionally, it may be beneficial to refactor the logic for handling small intervals and swappable endpoints to ensure that the code runs without issues for a broader range of input values.

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmin > vmax and increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif abs(vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0.0 and vmin == 0.0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if vmin > vmax and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected code incorporates better handling of extreme values to avoid potential overflows and ensures that the swapping of endpoints is executed properly to address decreasing intervals when necessary.
