The error message mentions "overflow encountered in scalar subtract" and "overflow encountered in scalar absolute". This suggests that there might be an overflow issue when performing arithmetic operations or taking the absolute value of large numbers.

In the `nonsingular` function, the potential error location is the calculation of `maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))`. This calculation involves taking the absolute value of `vmin` and `vmax`, and if these values are large, it might result in an overflow.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that for very large values of `vmin` and `vmax`, the absolute value calculation might exceed the capacity of the data type used for the calculation.

To fix the bug, we can modify the calculation of `maxabsvalue` to use conditional checks instead of directly taking the absolute value of `vmin` and `vmax`.

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmin < 0 and vmax < 0:
        maxabsvalue = -min(vmin, vmax)
    else:
        maxabsvalue = max(vmin, vmax)

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    if not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```
