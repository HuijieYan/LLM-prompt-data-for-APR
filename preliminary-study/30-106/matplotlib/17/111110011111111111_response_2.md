The error occurs because when the absolute value of `vmin` and `vmax` are calculated using `abs()`, an overflow error is encountered with large input values such as `clim = (-20000, 20000)` and `(-32768, 0)`.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `nonsingular` function to avoid the overflow when computing the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax`. One approach could be to cast `vmin` and `vmax` to `float` before calculating their absolute values.

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    # Cast to float to avoid overflow when computing absolute values
    vmin = float(vmin)
    vmax = float(vmax)

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    # Check if overflow may occur when trying to calculate absolute difference
    if (np.finfo(float).max - np.finfo(float).tiny) < maxabsvalue + vmin:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected code, the potential overflow issue is avoided by casting `vmin` and `vmax` to `float` before calculating their absolute values. Additionally, a check is included to avoid overflow during absolute difference calculation.
