Potential error location: The bug is likely occurring in the following line: `if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:`. If the `maxabsvalue` is less than the threshold, it sets `vmin` and `vmax` to `-expander` and `expander` respectively.

Reason behind the bug: The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of the condition when `maxabsvalue` is less than the threshold. This leads to incorrect manipulation of the endpoints `vmin` and `vmax`.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the correct comparison and manipulation of the endpoints `vmin` and `vmax` are done based on the given conditions and thresholds.
2. Update the logic for condition checking and endpoint manipulation to handle all possible input scenarios accurately.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmax < vmin and increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    return vmin, vmax
