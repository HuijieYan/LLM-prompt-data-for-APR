Potential error location: The error could be in the comparison `if vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` where it is checking if the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is smaller than the product of `maxabsvalue` and `tiny`.

Reason behind the bug: The bug might be occurring because the comparison `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` is not correctly handling cases where `vmin` and `vmax` are very small numbers, resulting in incorrect expansion of the interval.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: One approach to fix the bug could be to handle the edge cases of very small numbers in a more robust way, ensuring that the expansion of the interval is performed correctly.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif abs(vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```
