The potential error location within the problematic function is the calculation in the `if` condition where `maxabsvalue` is compared to a threshold based on the value of `tiny`. 

The bug occurs because the code incorrectly handles cases where the interval between `vmin` and `vmax` is very small. This causes issues with swapping values and not expanding the interval appropriately. 

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for expanding the interval when it is too small and also ensure that the swapping of values is handled correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    if increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    interval = vmax - vmin

    if interval < maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin -= expander
            vmax += expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if not increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```
