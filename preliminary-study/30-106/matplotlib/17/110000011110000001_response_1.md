The error message indicates that there is an overflow encountered in the scalar subtraction and scalar absolute calculation in the `nonsingular` function. The `overflow` and `RuntimeWarning` messages suggest that the calculations in the function are encountering numerical precision issues or are exceeding the valid range of values.

The potential error location within the `nonsingular` function is the block of code where the interval between `vmin` and `vmax` is evaluated and expanded based on certain conditions and thresholds.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely due to the comparison and manipulation of very large or very small absolute values, which can lead to overflow or underflow issues in the floating-point calculations.

To fix the bug, we can consider using conditional checks to avoid potential overflow issues and make the function more resilient to extreme numerical conditions.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            if increasing:
                vmin = -expander
                vmax = expander
            else:
                vmin = expander
                vmax = -expander
        else:
            if increasing:
                vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
                vmax += expander * abs(vmax)
            else:
                vmin += expander * abs(vmin)
                vmax -= expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected function, additional conditional checks are included to handle cases where extreme values or conditions can lead to numerical precision issues. The `increasing` flag is also considered for expansion and swapping of values.
