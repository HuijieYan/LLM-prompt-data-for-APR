The bug occurs in the `nonsingular` function in the `matplotlib/transforms.py` file. The error message indicates that a "RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar subtract" occurs at line 2799, where the subtraction `vmax - vmin` takes place.

The reason behind this bug is that the subtraction operation might lead to overflow due to the relationship between the supplied `vmin` and `vmax` values and their data types. 

To fix this bug, we can modify the code to ensure that overflow is handled properly. One approach is to explicitly cast the `vmin` and `vmax` values to a data type with a higher range, such as `np.float64`, before performing the subtraction operation. This will help to prevent overflow during the subtraction.

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(float(vmin)), abs(float(vmax)))  # explicit cast to np.float64
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif float(vmax) - float(vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:  # explicit cast to np.float64
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(float(vmin))  # explicit cast to np.float64
            vmax += expander*abs(float(vmax))  # explicit cast to np.float64

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

In this corrected code, we use `float()` to explicitly cast `vmin` and `vmax` values to `np.float64` before performing operations to avoid overflow issues.
