Potential error location: The error occurs in the "nonsingular" function within the "transforms.py" file when attempting to compute the maximum absolute value of vmin and vmax.

Reasons for the bug: The bug is caused by an overflow encountered in the computation of the absolute value of vmin and vmax. This occurs when the values are too large to be handled by the absolute value computation, resulting in a RuntimeWarning.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use try-except blocks to handle potential overflow errors during the computation of absolute values.
2. Scale down the values of vmin and vmax before computing their absolute values to avoid overflow.
3. Update the function to handle large values more robustly and efficiently.

Corrected code for the "nonsingular" function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    try:
        maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    except OverflowError:
        maxabsvalue = float('inf')

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```
In the corrected code, we have added a try-except block to handle potential overflow errors when computing the maximum absolute value. If an overflow error occurs, we set the maxabsvalue to infinity, ensuring that the subsequent computations can proceed without encountering an overflow. This approach addresses the bug and provides a more robust solution for handling large values in the "nonsingular" function.
