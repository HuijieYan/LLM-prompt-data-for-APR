The potential error in the code is in the condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny`. This condition is used to check if the interval is smaller than a certain threshold and needs to be expanded. However, the use of `maxabsvalue * tiny` may lead to incorrect results due to precision and rounding errors.

To fix the bug, we can modify the condition to compare the absolute difference between `vmax` and `vmin` with a small threshold value instead of using a product of `maxabsvalue` and `tiny`.

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif abs(vmax - vmin) <= tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

With this modification, the function should now correctly handle the range endpoints and avoid singularities.
