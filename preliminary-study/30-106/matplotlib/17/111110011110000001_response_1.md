The error message indicates that there is an overflow encountered in the function `nonsingular`. The overflow occurs when calculating the absolute value of `vmin` or `vmax` due to their range being too large.

The potential error location is the calculation of the absolute value using the `abs` function within the `nonsingular` function. This calculation is likely causing an overflow, leading to the error.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `nonsingular` function to handle overflow scenarios where the range of `vmin` and `vmax` is too large. One approach is to check for overflow conditions before calculating the absolute value and handle them appropriately.

Below is the corrected `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    # Handle overflow conditions
    if abs(vmin) > 1e300 or abs(vmax) > 1e300:
        return -expander, expander
      
    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

In this corrected function, we added a condition to check for overflow by comparing the absolute value of `vmin` and `vmax` to a large number (1e300 in this example). If the range is too large, the function returns the endpoints as -expander and expander to avoid an overflow situation.
