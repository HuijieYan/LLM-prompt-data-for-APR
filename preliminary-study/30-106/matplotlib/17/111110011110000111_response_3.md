The error message mentions a "RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar subtract" which indicates that there is an issue with subtraction in the code. Looking at the provided function `nonsingular`, the potential error location seems to be in the section where `vmax - vmin` is calculated.

The issue occurs because the function does not handle potential overflow that might occur during floating-point operations.

To fix this bug, you can rewrite the section where `vmax - vmin` is calculated to handle potential overflow. This can be achieved by directly comparing `vmax` and `vmin`, and then taking appropriate actions based on the comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    # Check if the absolute difference between vmax and vmin is less than the floating point precision limit
    if np.isclose(vmax, vmin, rtol=1e-15, atol=1e-15):
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            return -expander, expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if not increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

In the revised code, the use of direct comparison and `np.isclose` function helps to avoid potential overflow issues that may occur during floating-point operations. This should resolve the reported bug.
