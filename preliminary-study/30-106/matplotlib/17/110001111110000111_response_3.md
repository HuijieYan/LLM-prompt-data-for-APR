The error occurs in the `nonsingular` function in the `matplotlib.transforms` module. The error messages indicate that there are potential issues with overflow encountered in scalar subtraction and scalar absolute calculation. This problem arises due to the comparison and calculation of floating-point values that are very close to extremes and can lead to unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `nonsingular` function to handle extreme cases where overflow or extremely small values can cause issues. One approach is to refactor the conditional statements to handle cases where the absolute difference between `vmin` and `vmax` becomes very small compared to their absolute values.

Here is the corrected `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin and increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif abs(vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
        vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        
    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected function, the conditional statements have been modified to handle extreme cases more effectively, reducing the risk of overflow and unexpected runtime warnings. This should address the issues reported in the error messages.
