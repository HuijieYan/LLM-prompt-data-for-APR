The potential error in the function `nonsingular` is in the condition `if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:`. This condition checks if the absolute value of `vmin` or `vmax` is very small and adjusts the endpoint values accordingly. However, in some cases, the comparison results in unexpected behavior.

The bug occurs because in some cases, the items being compared have different types (int vs float) which can lead to unexpected results. This causes the condition to incorrectly evaluate to True when it should be False.

To fix the bug, we can cast the value `1e6 / tiny` as a float to ensure consistent comparison. Additionally, it is recommended to check for division by zero when `tiny` is zero to avoid potential errors.

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander
    
    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    if np.isclose(maxabsvalue, 0, atol=1e-15):  # Check for very small values to avoid division by zero
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif maxabsvalue < float(1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif np.isclose(vmax - vmin, maxabsvalue * tiny, atol=1e-15):  # Check for very small interval
        if np.isclose(vmax, 0, atol=1e-15) and np.isclose(vmin, 0, atol=1e-15):
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected code, we used `np.isclose` to check for approximate equality to handle floating-point comparisons. We also cast the value `1e6 / tiny` as a float to ensure consistent comparison.

These changes should fix the issues and ensure correct behavior of the `nonsingular` function.
