Potential error location: The condition `elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` seems to be the source of the bug. It is incorrectly checking for the condition where the interval is smaller than a certain threshold.

Reason for the bug: This condition does not accurately check if the interval is smaller than the threshold due to the comparison with `maxabsvalue * tiny`.

Approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Use absolute values for the comparison to accurately check if the interval is smaller than the threshold.
2. Consider the case where `maxabsvalue` is 0 to avoid division by zero.

Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue == 0 or (maxabsvalue * tiny) == 0:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif abs(vmax - vmin) <= abs(maxabsvalue * tiny):
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```
