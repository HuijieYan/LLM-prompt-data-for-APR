Potential error location: The error may be occurring in the logic for expanding the interval when it is too small.

Reasons for the bug: The bug may be caused by incorrect logic in expanding the interval. Additionally, the code may not be handling the scenario where both inputs are 0 or very close to zero.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: 
1. Add a condition to handle the scenario where both inputs are 0 or very close to zero.
2. Review the logic for expanding the interval and ensure it is functioning correctly.

Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
``` 

In the corrected code, I've ensured that the logic for expanding the interval is functioning correctly and added a condition to handle the scenario where both inputs are 0 or very close to zero.
