The error message indicates that there is an overflow encountered in the scalar subtraction and absolute calculation. This occurs in the "nonsingular" function, particularly in the section where the "maxabsvalue" is calculated.

The bug occurs because the "maxabsvalue" calculation may cause overflow, which leads to the runtime warnings seen in the error message.

To fix this bug, we can handle the potential overflow by revising the calculation of "maxabsvalue" to ensure that it does not result in an overflow.

Here's the corrected code for the "nonsingular" function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    if abs(vmin) > abs(vmax):
        maxabsvalue = abs(vmin)
    else:
        maxabsvalue = abs(vmax)

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected code, the calculation of "maxabsvalue" is revised to handle potential overflow. This should prevent the occurrence of the runtime warnings mentioned in the error message.
