The error message indicates that there is a "RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar subtract" and a "RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar absolute" during the execution of the `nonsingular` function.

Upon analyzing the test cases and error messages, it seems like the 'expander' and 'tiny' values being used are leading to overflow warnings when performing arithmetic operations.

The issue occurs because in the `nonsingular` function, the check for overflow in the `elif` block `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` and in the calculation of `maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))` can lead to overflow when the `vmin` and `vmax` values are significantly large numbers.

To fix this issue, the calculation and comparison need to be handled in a way that avoids potential overflows. One way to deal with it is by checking for potential overflows before the arithmetic operations.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
  
    # Check for potential overflow before arithmetic operations
    if maxabsvalue > 1e6 / tiny:
        expander = maxabsvalue * tiny
     
    # Avoid arithmetic operations that might lead to overflow
    if vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin = np.copysign(expander, vmin)
            vmax = np.copysign(expander, vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:

    return vmin, vmax
