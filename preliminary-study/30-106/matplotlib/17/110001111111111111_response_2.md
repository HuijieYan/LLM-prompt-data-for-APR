The error is occurring because the `maxabsvalue` calculation in the `nonsingular` function is encountering overflow errors for large absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax`.

The buggy function `nonsingular` aims to modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities, and it contains logic to handle different scenarios like swapping endpoints if necessary, avoiding infinite values, and expanding intervals that are too small.

The potential error location within the `nonsingular` function is identified as the calculation of `maxabsvalue` when large absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax` are encountered. The code uses the `max` and `abs` functions on these values, which could lead to overflow issues, especially when the dtype is an integer with a limited range.

To fix this bug, the calculation of `maxabsvalue` should be modified to handle large absolute values without encountering overflow errors. One approach to resolve this issue is to use a different method for calculating the maximum absolute value without causing overflow. For example, you could use the following approach to calculate `maxabsvalue`:

```python
maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
```

Here's the corrected `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ... (same as in the original function)
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif (vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny) or (vmax == 0 and vmin == 0):
        vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
        vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

With these changes, the `nonsingular` function should now be able to handle large absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax` without encountering overflow errors.
