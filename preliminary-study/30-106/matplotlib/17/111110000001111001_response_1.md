The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be the calculation of `maxabsvalue` as it is calculated based on the maximum absolute value of `vmin` and `vmax`.

The bug occurs because the `maxabsvalue` is being compared to a threshold based on `tiny`, which is inaccurate. Instead, `maxabsvalue` should be compared directly with `tiny`.

To fix the bug, we need to compare `maxabsvalue` with `tiny` directly, and expand the interval if `maxabsvalue` is smaller than `tiny`.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin -= expander
        vmax += expander

    if increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```
