The potential error location within the function is in the portion of the code that checks if the interval is smaller than the threshold `tiny` and then expands it. There is a conditional statement that checks if both `vmax` and `vmin` are 0 or very close to 0, but this doesn't cover the case when both values are very small but not exactly 0.

The bug occurs because the condition for expanding the interval based on the `tiny` threshold does not handle the case where both `vmax` and `vmin` are very small but not exactly 0, leading to potential errors.

A possible approach to fixing the bug is to add an additional condition to the existing check for the interval being smaller than the threshold `tiny` to account for the case when both `vmax` and `vmin` are very small but not exactly 0.

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    # check for inf or NaN inputs
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    # swap vmin and vmax if increasing is False and vmin is greater than vmax
    if not increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    # calculate the maximum absolute value of vmin and vmax
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))

    # check the interval size against the threshold and expand if necessary
    if vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if abs(vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
            if abs(vmax) <= tiny and abs(vmin) <= tiny:
                vmin = -expander
                vmax = expander
            else:
                vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
                vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if not increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```
