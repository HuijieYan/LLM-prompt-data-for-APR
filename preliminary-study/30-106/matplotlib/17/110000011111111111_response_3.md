The error occurs in the function `nonsingular` while trying to calculate the `maxabsvalue` as `max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))`. The error message indicates that there is an overflow encountered in scalar absolute when attempting this calculation.

The reason behind this error is that when vmin is equal to -32768, if we directly take the absolute value, it will result in an overflow because the minimum value of an int16 is -32768. The same is true for the value of 32768 when taking its absolute value.

To fix this, we can convert `vmin` and `vmax` to `float` before taking their absolute values to operate on them safely without causing an overflow.

Below is the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    # Convert vmin and vmax to float before taking their absolute values
    vmin = float(vmin)
    vmax = float(vmax)
    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```
