The error occurs in the `nonsingular` function from the `matplotlib.transforms` module. The error message indicates "overflow encountered in scalar subtract" and "overflow encountered in scalar absolute", which points to potential issues with numerical operations, specifically subtraction and absolute value calculation.

The function `nonsingular` is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities by expanding the interval if it is too small or swapping the endpoints if necessary.

Upon analysis of the function, the potential cause for the error is the handling of edge cases, particularly when dealing with very large or very small values. The comparisons and operations within the function may not be robust enough to handle extreme values without causing overflow or numerical inaccuracies.

To fix the bug:
1. Ensure that the comparisons and operations within the function are robust with respect to extreme values, avoiding overflow and numerical inaccuracies.
2. Add additional checks and safeguards to handle edge cases involving large or small values to prevent overflow and numerical instability.

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif np.abs(vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * np.abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * np.abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected function includes additional checks and robust numerical operations to prevent overflow and numerical instability when dealing with extreme values.
