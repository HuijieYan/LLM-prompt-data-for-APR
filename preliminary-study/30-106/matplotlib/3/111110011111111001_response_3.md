Potential Error Location: The buggy function `_recache` is not updating the `_filled` attribute, which is causing the test to fail.

Reasons for the Bug: The `_recache` function is not properly updating all the required attributes, including `_filled`, which leads to incorrect results in the test.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: Update the `_recache` function to properly set the value of the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `_fillstyle`.

Corrected Code:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update the _filled attribute based on the _fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```
By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `_fillstyle`, the corrected code ensures that the `_filled` attribute reflects the correct value, and the test should pass successfully.
