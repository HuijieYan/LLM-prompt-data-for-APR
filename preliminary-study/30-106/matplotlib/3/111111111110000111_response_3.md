The error occurring in the test function `test_marker_fillstyle` is due to the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` class. The `is_filled` method is returning the opposite of what is expected, leading to a failed assertion in the test function.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `_recache` method of the `MarkerStyle` class. Specifically, the line `self._filled = True` should be updated to `self._filled = False` to correctly represent the `fillstyle` of the marker.

The bug occurs because the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter, which results in the incorrect behavior when using the marker with a custom `fillstyle`.

To fix the bug, the `_recache` method should be updated to correctly handle the `fillstyle`. Additionally, the `_filled` attribute should be set based on the value of `fillstyle`. Update the `_recache` method as follows:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True

    self._marker_function()
```

With this change, the `MarkerStyle` class will correctly handle the `fillstyle`, ensuring that the markers are hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

After applying this change, the test case should no longer fail, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
