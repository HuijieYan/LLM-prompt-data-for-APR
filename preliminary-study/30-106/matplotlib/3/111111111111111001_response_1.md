Analysis:
The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is not returning the expected value. This is because the `_filled` attribute is not being set to the expected value within the `_recache` method. 

Error Location:
The issue is with setting the `_filled` attribute within the `_recache` method of the `MarkerStyle` class.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The `_recache` method is not setting the `_filled` attribute to the expected value, causing the `is_filled` method to return an unexpected value.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Set the `_filled` attribute to the expected value within the `_recache` method to ensure that the `is_filled` method returns the correct value.
2. Update the `_recache` method to properly handle the `_filled` attribute based on the input parameters.

Corrected Code:
```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():
    # ... omitted code ...

    # the corrected function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Set _filled based on _fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```
In the corrected code, the `_recache` method now sets the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `_fillstyle`, ensuring that it reflects the correct filled state of the marker.
