The error message from the test function states "assert not True", which suggests that the method `is_filled` within the `MarkerStyle` class is not behaving as expected. This is likely caused by the `_recache` method not correctly updating the `_filled` attribute in the `MarkerStyle` class.

The `_recache` method in the `MarkerStyle` class sets the `_filled` attribute to True unconditionally. This means that even if the fillstyle is set to 'none', it will not be reflected in the value of `_filled`. This is why the test fails when checking `marker_style.is_filled()`.

To fix this issue, the `_recache` method should include logic to update the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle set during the initialization of the `MarkerStyle` instance.

The corrected code for the `_recache` method is as follows:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle, the `is_filled` method should now correctly reflect whether the marker is filled or not.

After making this change, the test function should pass and the marker should correctly display as hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting the fillstyle to 'none'.
