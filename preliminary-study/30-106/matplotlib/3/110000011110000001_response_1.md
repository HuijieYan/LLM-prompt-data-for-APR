The error message suggests that the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` class is returning the wrong value. This method is likely impacted by the `_recache` function, which is responsible for resetting the attributes of the `MarkerStyle` class. It seems that the `filled` attribute of the `MarkerStyle` class is not being reset properly when the `_recache` function is called, causing the `is_filled` method to return the wrong value.

Given this context, the bug most likely occurs in the `_recache` function where the `filled` attribute of the `MarkerStyle` class is not properly reset.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `filled` attribute of the `MarkerStyle` class is reset to its default value when the `_recache` function is called. The corrected function is provided below:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Reset the filled attribute to its default value
    self._marker_function()
```
