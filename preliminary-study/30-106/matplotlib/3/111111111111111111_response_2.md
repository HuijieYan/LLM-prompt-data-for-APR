The buggy function is `MarkerStyle()._recache()`. The error message from the test function indicates that there is a problem with the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` class. The test is failing because `marker_style.is_filled()` is expected to return `False` but it actually returns `True`.

The bug is caused by the incorrect initialization in the `_recache` method, where `self._filled` is always set to `True` regardless of the `fillstyle`. This is incorrect behavior because the intended functionality is to set `self._filled` based on the value of `self._fillstyle`.

To fix the bug, the `_recache` method should set `self._filled` to `True` only when `self._fillstyle` is not equal to `'none'`, and to `False` otherwise.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` method:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the test case `test_marker_fillstyle` should pass without any assertion errors.

The issue on GitHub can be resolved by letting the user know about this fix and advising them to update their code with the corrected version of the `MarkerStyle` class.
