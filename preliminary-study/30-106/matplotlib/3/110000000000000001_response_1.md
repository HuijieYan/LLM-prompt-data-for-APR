Potential error location: The potential error location is the call to self._marker_function().

Reasons for the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the function _recache() is trying to call a method or function _marker_function that is not defined within the scope of the class. This will result in a NameError.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Check if the _marker_function is a valid method/function within the class or if it should be passed in as an argument to the _recache() method.

Corrected code:

```python
def _recache(self, marker_function=None):
    if marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    marker_function()
```
