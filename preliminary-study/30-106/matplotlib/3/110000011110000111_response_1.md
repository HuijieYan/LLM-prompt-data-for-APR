Potential Error Location:
The bug is likely to be in the `is_filled` method of the `markers.MarkerStyle` class.

Reason for Bug:
The bug is occurring because the `_marker_function` is being called at the end of the `_recache` method, which would presumably make any changes to the marker properties before the `markers.MarkerStyle` object is created.

Approach to Fix:
The function should be modified to set the `self._filled` variable according to the `fillstyle`. The `_alt_path` and `_alt_transform` should also be set based on the `fillstyle`. This will ensure that the `is_filled` method returns the correct value.

Corrected Function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    
    # Fixing the fillstyle with respect to the '_filled' property
    if self._fillstyle in ['full', 'left', 'right']:
        self._filled = True
    else:
        self._filled = False
    
    # Set _alt_path and _alt_transform based on the fillstyle
    if self._fillstyle in ['top', 'bottom', 'right', 'left']:
        self._alt_path = _empty_path
        self._alt_transform = IdentityTransform()
    else:
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
    
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._marker_function()
```
With these changes, the `_recache` method should correctly set the `_filled` property, which should in turn resolve the bug in the `test_marker_fillstyle` function.
