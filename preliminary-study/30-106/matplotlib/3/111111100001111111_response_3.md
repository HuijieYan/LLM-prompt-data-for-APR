The issue is with the `_recache` method of the `MarkerStyle` class. The problem is that the `_filled` attribute is not being updated based on the `fillstyle` attribute.

The reason behind the bug is that the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` unconditionally in the `_recache` method, irrespective of the `fillstyle` value.

To fix the bug, the `_filled` attribute should be updated based on the `fillstyle` attribute. If the `fillstyle` is not 'none', `_filled` should be set to `True`, otherwise, it should be set to `False`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` method:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_recache` method will correctly set the value of `_filled` based on the `fillstyle` attribute, and the markers should be hollow when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.
