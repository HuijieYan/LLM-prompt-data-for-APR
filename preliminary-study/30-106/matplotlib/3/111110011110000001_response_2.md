The potential error location within the problematic function is the `is_filled` method, which is not properly implemented.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `is_filled` method is not returning the correct value.

To fix the bug, the `is_filled` method needs to be modified to return the correct value based on the `_filled` attribute.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()

    def is_filled(self):
        return self._filled
```
