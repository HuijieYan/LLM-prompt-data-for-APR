Potential error location: The buggy function _recache does not check if the _marker_function is defined before calling it.

Reasons behind the bug: The function _recache assumes that _marker_function is always defined before calling it. This can lead to a 'NoneType' object has no attribute error if _marker_function is not defined.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add a check to see if _marker_function is defined before calling it.
2. Implement error handling if _marker_function is not defined.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return

    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    
    if hasattr(self._marker_function, '__call__'):
        self._marker_function()
    else:
        # Handle the case where _marker_function is not callable
        pass
```
