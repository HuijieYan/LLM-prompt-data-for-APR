The error message indicates that the `is_filled` function is not returning the expected value when called on the `MarkerStyle` object.

Upon reviewing the `MarkerStyle` class, it appears that there is no `is_filled` method defined. The bug likely occurs due to the absence of the `is_filled` method in the `MarkerStyle` class, which is called from the test function.

To fix this, the `MarkerStyle` class needs to have an `is_filled` method defined that returns the value of the `_filled` attribute. Additionally, the `MarkerStyle` class should also have a `get_fillstyle` method to retrieve the fill style, as used in the test function.

Here's the corrected code for the `MarkerStyle` class including the `is_filled` and `get_fillstyle` methods:

```python
# class declaration containing the fixed function
class MarkerStyle():
    # ... omitted code ...

    def __init__(self, marker, fillstyle=None):
        # constructor code
        pass
    
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
    
    def is_filled(self):
        return self._filled
    
    def get_fillstyle(self):
        return self._fillstyle
```

With these changes, the `is_filled` and `get_fillstyle` methods now exist in the `MarkerStyle` class, and they should return the expected values when called.
