Potential error location within the problematic function:
The bug is likely in the implementation of the `_recache` function. The `_filled` attribute is expected to be set to True in both test cases and is expected to affect the behavior of `marker_style.is_filled()`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The `_recache` method is not correctly setting the `_filled` attribute. As a result, the `marker_style.is_filled()` method is returning an incorrect value, leading to the assertion error in the test case.

Approach to fixing the bug:
The `_recache` function should correctly set the `_filled` attribute to the expected value based on the input fill style. By ensuring that the `_filled` attribute corresponds to the fill style, the `marker_style.is_filled()` method will return the expected result.

Corrected code:
```python
# Corrected _recache method
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Set _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```
