The error occurs in the `test_marker_fillstyle` function, specifically in the line `assert not marker_style.is_filled()`. This is because the `is_filled()` method is not working as expected, leading to the assertion error.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `_recache` method, where the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` regardless of the `fillstyle` attribute value.

The bug occurs because the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally in the `_recache` method, which does not consider the `fillstyle` attribute.

To fix the bug, you need to update the `_recache` method to take into account the `fillstyle` attribute value and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` method:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With these changes, the `_filled` attribute will now be set based on the `fillstyle` attribute value, fixing the bug and allowing the `test_marker_fillstyle` function to run without any assertion errors.
