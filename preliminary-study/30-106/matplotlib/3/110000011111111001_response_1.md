The test function `test_marker_fillstyle` creates a `MarkerStyle` object with the fillstyle set to 'none' and then asserts that the fillstyle is indeed 'none' and that the marker is not filled. The error message indicates that the assertion for `not marker_style.is_filled()` fails.

The issue lies within the `_recache` method of the `MarkerStyle` class, where it sets `self._filled` to `True` unconditionally. This causes the `is_filled` method to return `True` regardless of the `fillstyle` set during object creation.

The potential cause of this bug is that the `_recache` method is not correctly updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` of the `MarkerStyle` object.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` set during object creation. This can be achieved by adding a conditional statement to check the `fillstyle` and set `_filled` accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` method:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle.lower() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this change, the `_filled` attribute will be set based on the `fillstyle` parameter, and the `is_filled` method will return the correct value based on the `fillstyle` parameter provided during object creation.
