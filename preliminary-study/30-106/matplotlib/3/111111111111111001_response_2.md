The error message from the test function indicates that the issue lies within the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` class. The `is_filled` method does not provide the expected result. 

The potential error location is the `_recache` method of the `MarkerStyle` class. The bug occurs because, in the `_recache` method, the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True` at the end of the method. The `fillstyle` attribute is not being considered in the recaching process, which impacts the `is_filled` method.

To fix the bug, we need to consider the `fillstyle` attribute and update the `_filled` attribute accordingly. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = (self._fillstyle != 'none')
        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected code, the `_filled` attribute is updated based on the value of the `fillstyle` attribute. This should ensure that the `is_filled` method returns the expected result.
