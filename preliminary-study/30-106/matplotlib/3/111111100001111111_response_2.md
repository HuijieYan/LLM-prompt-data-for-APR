Potential error location: The bug is likely occurring in the `_recache` method of the `MarkerStyle` class where the `_filled` attribute is not being set correctly.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the `_filled` attribute is set to `False` regardless of the input `fillstyle` parameter.

Approach for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, we need to set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If `fillstyle` is 'none', then `_filled` should be set to `False`, otherwise it should be set to `True`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` method:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this corrected code, the `_recache` method will set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, fixing the bug where the markers were not appearing as hollow when the `fillstyle` was set to 'none'.
