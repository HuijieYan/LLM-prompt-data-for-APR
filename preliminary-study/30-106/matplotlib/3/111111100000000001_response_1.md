Potential error location: The issue is likely with the line `self._marker_function()` which is attempting to call a method or function that may not be defined.

Reasons behind the bug: The error is likely occurring because the `_marker_function` attribute is not defined, or it is not being assigned a method or function that can be called.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the `_marker_function` attribute is being properly initialized or assigned within the class.
2. Ensure that `_marker_function` is actually a method or function that can be called.

Corrected code:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```
