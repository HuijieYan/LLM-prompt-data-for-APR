The buggy function `_recache` is intended to perform some operations and then call the `_marker_function`. However, for both buggy cases, it seems that the `self._filled` variable is not being set to the correct value before calling `_marker_function`. Instead, it is being set to `False`, even though the expected value is `True`. This discrepancy in the value of `self._filled` will likely lead to incorrect functionality of the `_marker_function`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `self._filled` is set to `True` before calling `_marker_function`. 

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True  # Set _filled to True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the variable `self._filled` will be set to `True` before calling the `_marker_function`, ensuring that the expected behavior is maintained.

The correction ensures that `self._filled` is set to the expected value before calling the `_marker_function`, thereby fixing the bug.
