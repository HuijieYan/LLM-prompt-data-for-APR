The issue seems to be related to the fillstyle of markers not being set correctly. The code is trying to create a custom marker style with fillstyle set to 'none' to make the markers hollow, but it is not functioning as expected.

The potential error location is within the _recache method, specifically in the line self._filled = True. This line sets the _filled attribute to True unconditionally, which conflicts with the intention of creating hollow markers.

The bug occurs because the _filled attribute is being set to True regardless of the fillstyle set for the MarkerStyle object. This results in the markers not being hollow as intended.

To fix this bug, the _filled attribute should be set based on the fillstyle parameter of the MarkerStyle object. If the fillstyle is 'none', then the _filled attribute should be set to False to create hollow markers.

Below is the corrected code for the _recache method:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Set _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the _recache method as shown above, the _filled attribute will be set based on the fillstyle of the MarkerStyle object. This should resolve the issue with markers not being hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.
