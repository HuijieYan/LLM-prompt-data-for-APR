The bug seems to be related to the `_recache` function in the `markers.py` file. The function is meant to reset some attributes of the `MarkerStyle` object but it is not working as expected.

The bug occurs because the `self._filled` attribute is not being set based on the `self._fillstyle` value. This is causing the markers to always be filled, regardless of the `fillstyle` setting.

To fix the bug, the `_recache` function should be updated to set the `self._filled` attribute based on the `self._fillstyle` value.

Here is the corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this update, the `self._filled` attribute will be set based on the `self._fillstyle` value, and the markers should now appear as hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is specified.

This should resolve the issue where markers were not appearing as hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `markers.MarkerStyle()`'s `fillstyle` to `'none'.

Additionally, the GitHub issue title could be: "Markers appear filled when using ax.scatter() with MarkerStyle's fillstyle set to 'none'".
