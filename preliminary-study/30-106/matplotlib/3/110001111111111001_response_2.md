The test case `test_marker_fillstyle` is checking if the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` class returns `False` when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` instead of `False`.

The potential error location is within the `_recache` method of the `MarkerStyle` class, specifically the line `self._filled = True`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True` within the `_recache` method, regardless of the `fillstyle` set during the instantiation of the `MarkerStyle` object.

To fix the bug, the `_recache` method should be modified to take into account the `fillstyle` set during the instantiation of the `MarkerStyle` object. It should set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` value, i.e., if `fillstyle` is 'none', then `_filled` should be set to `False`, otherwise, it should be set to `True`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` method:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Set _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `MarkerStyle` object's `_filled` attribute will be correctly updated based on the `fillstyle` parameter during instantiation, and the test case `test_marker_fillstyle` should pass without any assertion errors.
