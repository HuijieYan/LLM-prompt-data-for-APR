Potential error location: The error might be in the line `self._marker_function()`, as it seems to be trying to call a function that doesn't exist.

Reasons for the bug: The function is trying to call a function `self._marker_function()` without checking if it exists, which can lead to an AttributeError if `_marker_function` is not defined.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Add a check to see if `self._marker_function` is not None before calling it.

Corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/matplotlib_3/lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# corrected function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    if callable(self._marker_function):  # check if the function is callable
        self._marker_function()
```
