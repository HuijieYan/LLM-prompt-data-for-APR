Potential error:
The bug in the provided function is that it is trying to call a method _marker_function without checking if it exists. If _marker_function does not exist, it will raise an AttributeError.

Reason for the bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not check if _marker_function is defined before calling it. If _marker_function is not defined, it will result in an AttributeError, causing the function to fail.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we can add a check to see if _marker_function exists before calling it. If it does not exist, we should handle it accordingly to prevent an AttributeError.

Corrected code:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```
