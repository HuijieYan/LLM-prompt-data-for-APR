The error message from the test function indicates that the method `is_filled()` for `MarkerStyle` is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`. This error occurs because the `_recache()` method, which sets the `_filled` attribute, is not correctly being called or setting `_filled` to `False` as expected.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `self._marker_function()`. It seems like this is trying to call a function that sets `_filled` to `True` instead of setting it directly in the `_recache` method.

To fix this bug, the `self._filled` attribute needs to be set to `False` in the `_recache` method instead of trying to call an undefined `_marker_function`. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False
```

With this correction, the `MarkerStyle` object will correctly report that it is not filled when `fillstyle='none'` is set.

Additionally, it would be beneficial to update the associated GitHub issue with the corrected information and reach out to the original poster with the fix.
