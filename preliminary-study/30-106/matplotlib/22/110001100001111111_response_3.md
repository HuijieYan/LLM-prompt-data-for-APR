The error message indicates a TypeError when trying to use a list of datetime objects as bins in the plt.hist function. The error occurs due to the mismatched comparison between instances of 'float' and 'datetime.datetime', specifically in a comparison using the '<' operator.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the code that handles comparisons or conversions between datetime objects and float values, especially in the context of bin edges.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function does not handle datetime objects properly when used as bin edges, leading to type promotion errors and incorrect comparisons between datetime and float.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to explicitly convert datetime objects to numerical values (e.g., using mpl.dates.date2num) when creating bin edges. This would ensure that bin edges are handled uniformly and prevent any type promotion errors.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def hist(self, x, bins=None, range=None, density=False, weights=None,
         cumulative=False, bottom=None, histtype='bar', align='mid',
         orientation='vertical', rwidth=None, log=False,
         color=None, label=None, stacked=False, **kwargs):
    """
    Plot a histogram.

    ...

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : (n,) array or sequence of (n,) arrays
        Input values, this takes either a single array or a sequence of arrays which are not required to be of the same length.

    bins : int or sequence or str, optional
        If *bins* is an integer, it defines the number of equal-width bins in the range.

        If *bins* is a sequence, it defines the bin edges, including the left edge of the first bin and the right edge of the last bin. All but the last (righthand-most) bin is half-open. 

        If *bins* is a string, it is one of the binning strategies supported by `numpy.histogram_bin_edges': 'auto', 'fd', 'doane', 'scott', 'stone', 'rice', 'sturges', or 'sqrt'.

        The default is :rc:`hist.bins`.

    ...

    Returns
    -------
    n : array or list of arrays
        ...

    bins : array
        The edges of the bins. Length nbins + 1 (nbins left edges and right edge of last bin). Always a single array even when multiple data sets are passed in.

    patches : list or list of lists
        ...

    ...

    """
    if isinstance(bins, list) and all(isinstance(item, datetime.datetime) for item in bins):
        bins = mpl.dates.date2num(bins)  # Convert datetime to numerical values

    # The rest of the function remains the same

    # ...

    return tops, bins, cbook.silent_list('Lists of Patches', patches)
