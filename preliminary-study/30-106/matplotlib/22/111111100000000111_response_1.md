The bug appears to be related to the `hist` method in the `Axes` class of the `matplotlib` library. The error message indicates a type promotion error with datetime bins in `hist`. The user is attempting to specify date or datetime objects as the bin edges for the `hist` method but encounters a TypeError due to an unsupported comparison operation between float and datetime objects.

The potential error location within the `hist` method seems to be the handling of datetime objects as bin edges, particularly in the part where bins are processed and the histogram is computed. It is likely that this portion of the code is not handling datetime objects correctly, leading to the type promotion error.

The bug occurs because the `hist` method is not properly handling datetime objects as bin edges when computing the histogram. This results in a TypeError when attempting to compare datetime objects with floats.

To fix the bug, the `hist` method should be updated to handle datetime objects appropriately when computing the histogram and processing the bin edges.

Here's the corrected code for the `hist` method:

```python
# ... omitted code ...

# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@_preprocess_data(replace_names=["x", 'weights'], label_namer="x")
def hist(self, x, bins=None, range=None, density=False, weights=None,
         cumulative=False, bottom=None, histtype='bar', align='mid',
         orientation='vertical', rwidth=None, log=False,
         color=None, label=None, stacked=False, **kwargs):
    # Ensure that datetime bins are converted to numerical values before processing
    if bins is not None and all(isinstance(b, datetime) for b in bins):
        bins = mpl.dates.date2num(bins)

    # Rest of the code remains the same as the original function

    # ... remaining code ...

    if nx == 1:
        return tops[0], bins, cbook.silent_list('Patch', patches[0])
    else:
        return tops, bins, cbook.silent_list('Lists of Patches', patches)
```

In the corrected code, we check if the `bins` parameter contains datetime objects and then use `mpl.dates.date2num` to convert them to numerical values before further processing. This modification should address the type promotion error with datetime bins in the `hist` method.
