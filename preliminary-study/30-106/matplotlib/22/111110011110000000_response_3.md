# Corrected function
class Axes(_AxesBase):
    """
    The `Axes` contains most of the figure elements: `~.axis.Axis`,
    `~.axis.Tick`, `~.lines.Line2D`, `~.text.Text`, `~.patches.Polygon`, etc.,
    and sets the coordinate system.
    
    The `Axes` instance supports callbacks through a callbacks attribute which
    is a `~.cbook.CallbackRegistry` instance.  The events you can connect to
    are 'xlim_changed' and 'ylim_changed' and the callback will be called with
    func(*ax*) where *ax* is the `Axes` instance.
    
    Attributes
    ----------
    dataLim : `.Bbox`
        The bounding box enclosing all data displayed in the Axes.
    viewLim : `.Bbox`
        The view limits in data coordinates.

        Plot a histogram.
    
        Compute and draw the histogram of *x*.  The return value is a tuple
        (*n*, *bins*, *patches*) or ([*n0*, *n1*, ...], *bins*, [*patches0*,
        *patches1*,...]) if the input contains multiple data.  See the
        documentation of the *weights* parameter to draw a histogram of
        already-binned data.
    
        Multiple data can be provided via *x* as a list of datasets
        of potentially different length ([*x0*, *x1*, ...]), or as
        a 2-D ndarray in which each column is a dataset.  Note that
        the ndarray form is transposed relative to the list form.
    
        Masked arrays are not supported.
        
        Other Parameters
        ----------------
        bins : int or sequence, optional
            If *bins* is an integer, it defines the number of equal-width bins
            in the range.
    
            If *bins* is a sequence, it defines the bin edges, including the
            left edge of the first bin and the right edge of the last bin;
            in this case, bins may be unequally spaced.  All but the last
            (righthand-most) bin is half-open.  In other words, if *bins* is::
    
                [1, 2, 3, 4]
    
            then the first bin is ``[1, 2)`` (including 1, but excluding 2) and
            the second ``[2, 3)``.  The last bin, however, is ``[3, 4]``, which
            *includes* 4.
    
            If *bins* is a string, it is one of the binning strategies
            supported by `numpy.histogram_bin_edges`: 'auto', 'fd', 'doane',
            'scott', 'stone', 'rice', 'sturges', or 'sqrt'.
    
            The default is :rc:`hist.bins`.
