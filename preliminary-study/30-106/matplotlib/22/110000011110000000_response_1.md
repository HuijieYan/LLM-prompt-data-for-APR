    """
    Plot a histogram.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : (n,) array or sequence of (n,) arrays
        Input values, this takes either a single array or a sequence of
        arrays which are not required to be of the same length.

    bins : int or sequence or str, optional
        If *bins* is an integer, it defines the number of equal-width bins
        in the range.

        If *bins* is a sequence, it defines the bin edges, including the
        left edge of the first bin and the right edge of the last bin;
        in this case, bins may be unequally spaced.

        If *bins* is a string, it is one of the binning strategies
        supported by `numpy.histogram`.

        The default is :rc:`hist.bins`.

    stacked : bool, optional
        If ``True``, multiple data are stacked on top of each other. If ``False``, stacked is not applied.

        Default is ``False``

    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    **kwargs : `~matplotlib.patches.Patch` properties
        Other keyword arguments specific to the histogram plot.

    Returns
    -------
    Tuple
        Tuple containing the histogram values, the edges of the bins, and a list or list of lists of individual patches used to create the histogram.

    """
    return tops, bins, patches
