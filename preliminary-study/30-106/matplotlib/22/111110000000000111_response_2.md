The error occurs when trying to use a list of datetime objects as the bin edges in the hist method. 

The potential error location within the problematic function is the section where the bins are processed and used to compute the histogram.

The error occurs because the hist method does not handle datetime bins correctly, leading to a type promotion error.

To fix the bug, the code should be updated to handle datetime bins correctly. This may involve converting the datetime bins to a format compatible with the histogram computation.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@_preprocess_data(replace_names=["x", 'weights'], label_namer="x")
def hist(self, x, bins=None, range=None, density=False, weights=None, cumulative=False, bottom=None, histtype='bar', align='mid', orientation='vertical', rwidth=None, log=False, color=None, label=None, stacked=False, **kwargs):

    # ... omitted code ...

    if bins is not None and any(isinstance(b, (datetime, pd.Timestamp)) for b in bins):
        # Convert datetime bins to a format compatible with histogram computation
        bins = mpl.dates.date2num(bins)

    # ... rest of the code remains unchanged ...
```

In this corrected code, the section that checks if bins contain datetime objects has been added. If any of the elements in bins are instances of datetime or pd.Timestamp, they are converted to a format compatible with histogram computation using mpl.dates.date2num. This ensures that the datetime bins are handled correctly when computing the histogram.
