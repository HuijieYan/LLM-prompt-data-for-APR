    Plot a histogram.

    Compute and draw the histogram of *x*.  The return value is a tuple
    (*n*, *bins*, *patches*) or ([*n0*, *n1*, ...], *bins*, [*patches0*,
    *patches1*,...]) if the input contains multiple data.  See the
    documentation of the *weights* parameter to draw a histogram of
    already-binned data.

    Multiple data can be provided via *x* as a list of datasets
    of potentially different length ([*x0*, *x1*, ...]), or as
    a 2-D ndarray in which each column is a dataset.  Note that
    the ndarray form is transposed relative to the list form.

    Masked arrays are not supported.

    The *bins*, *range*, *weights*, and *density* parameters behave as in
    `numpy.histogram`.
