The error occurs when the `plt.hist` function is called with datetime data and bins as a list of datetimes. The error message indicates that the comparison between a float and a datetime object is not supported, which leads to a type promotion error.

The potential error location within the function is when the `np.histogram` function is called with datetime data and bins, leading to a type promotion error because datetime objects cannot be directly compared with floats in the histogram calculation process.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where bins are datetime objects properly, causing a type promotion error during the histogram calculation.

To fix the bug, the function should handle the case where bins contain datetime objects. The bins should be converted to a format that can be used for comparison with the datetime data, such as using `mpl.dates.date2num` for conversion.

Corrected code for the `hist` function:

```python
def hist(self, x, bins=None, range=None, density=False, weights=None,
         cumulative=False, bottom=None, histtype='bar', align='mid',
         orientation='vertical', rwidth=None, log=False,
         color=None, label=None, stacked=False, **kwargs):
    """
    Plot a histogram.
    """
    # ... omitted code ...

    # Convert bins to a format compatible with datetime objects
    if isinstance(bins, list) and all(isinstance(b, datetime) for b in bins):
        bins = mpl.dates.date2num(bins)

    m, bins = np.histogram(x[i], bins, weights=w[i], **hist_kwargs)

    # ... omitted code ...
```

In this corrected code, the bins are checked for being a list of datetime objects. If so, they are converted to a compatible format for datetime objects using `mpl.dates.date2num` before passing them to the `np.histogram` function. This approach ensures that the bins are in a suitable format for comparison with datetime data, avoiding the type promotion error.
