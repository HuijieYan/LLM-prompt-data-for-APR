The potential error location within the `hist` function is likely related to the handling of datetime bin edges, as indicated in the error message:

"TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'float' and 'datetime.datetime'"

This error suggests that there is a comparison between a float and a datetime object, which should not be happening when handling datetime bin edges.

The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle datetime bin edges and attempts to compare datetime objects with floats, which is not allowed.

To fix the bug, the function should handle datetime bin edges properly by converting them into a format that allows for direct comparison. This may involve converting the datetime bin edges to a numerical format early on in the function to avoid potential type promotion errors.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic `hist` function:

```python
# Corrected hist function
def hist(self, x, bins=None, range=None, density=False, weights=None,
         cumulative=False, bottom=None, histtype='bar', align='mid',
         orientation='vertical', rwidth=None, log=False,
         color=None, label=None, stacked=False, **kwargs):
    """
    Plot a histogram.

    ... (rest of the docstring remains the same)

    """

    # ... (previous code remains the same up to this point)

    if isinstance(bins, list) and all(isinstance(b, datetime) for b in bins):
        # Convert datetime bins to numerical format for comparison
        bins = mpl.dates.date2num(bins)

    # ... (remaining code remains the same)

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

In the corrected code, the `hist` function now checks if the bins are a list of datetime objects and, if so, converts them to a numerical format using `mpl.dates.date2num` for comparison. This approach should prevent the type promotion error with datetime bins.
