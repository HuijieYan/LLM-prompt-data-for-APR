The error seems to be occurring because the `date_edges` are being passed as bins for the `plt.hist` function, but internally, the function tries to perform a comparison operation involving the `datetime` objects and float values. This leads to the TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'float' and 'datetime.datetime'. 

One potential error location within the problematic function is the area where the `plt.hist` function is being called with the `date_edges` bins.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `date_edges` bins, which contain datetime objects, are not being handled properly when passed to the `plt.hist` function.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that the `date_edges` bins with datetime objects are handled correctly within the `plt.hist` function. This may involve converting the datetime objects to a suitable numerical format that can be used for binning.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def hist(self, x, bins=None, range=None, density=False, weights=None,
         cumulative=False, bottom=None, histtype='bar', align='mid',
         orientation='vertical', rwidth=None, log=False,
         color=None, label=None, stacked=False, **kwargs):
    # Handle the case when bins contain datetime objects
    if isinstance(bins, (list, tuple)) and all(isinstance(item, datetime.datetime) for item in bins):
        bins = mpl.dates.date2num(bins)  # Convert datetime objects to a suitable numerical format
    # Rest of the code remains the same
    # ...
```
In this corrected code, we handle the case when `bins` contain datetime objects by checking its type and then using `mpl.dates.date2num` to convert the datetime objects to a suitable numerical format before further processing.
