The error occurs when trying to use a list of datetime objects as the bin edges in the `plt.hist` function. The error message indicates a type promotion error, specifically related to comparing instances of 'float' and 'datetime.datetime'.

The potential error location within the `hist` method is likely related to the handling of bin edges when using datetime objects.

The bug occurs because the `hist` method does not handle datetime bin edges properly. When trying to use a list of datetime objects as bin edges, the method fails to handle the comparison operations with these datetime objects.

To fix the bug, the `hist` method should be modified to handle datetime bin edges correctly. This will involve implementing logic to convert the datetime bin edges to an appropriate format that allows for comparison operations.

Here's the corrected code for the `hist` method:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.colors as mcolors
import matplotlib.cbook as cbook
from numbers import Number
import itertools
from matplotlib import rcParams
from datetime import datetime

# ... (other functions and imports)

def hist(self, x, bins=None, range=None, density=False, weights=None,
             cumulative=False, bottom=None, histtype='bar', align='mid',
             orientation='vertical', rwidth=None, log=False,
             color=None, label=None, stacked=False, **kwargs):
    """
    Plot a histogram.
    (function body remains the same as original code)

    # Existing code remains the same

    """
    # Existing code remains the same

    # Handling datetime bin edges
    if all(isinstance(b, datetime) for b in bins):
        bins = mpl.dates.date2num(bins)

    # Existing code remains the same
```

In this corrected code, we check if all elements in `bins` are instances of datetime objects. If they are, we convert the datetime bin edges to a format suitable for comparison operations using `mpl.dates.date2num`. This modification ensures that datetime bin edges can be handled correctly within the `hist` method.
