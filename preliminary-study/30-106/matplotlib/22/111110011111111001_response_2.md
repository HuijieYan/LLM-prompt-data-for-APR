The error occurs when calling the `ax.hist()` function inside the test. The error message indicates that there is a TypeError, specifically related to the comparison between a float and a datetime.

The issue is likely occurring within the `hist` method of the `Axes` class where the np.histogram function is called. The error is likely being triggered when np.histogram internally calls `_search_sorted_inclusive` function from the numpy library. This function seems to be used to calculate the histogram bins.

The bug is occurring because the `hist` function is not handling the datetime values correctly. It seems that the date values are being converted to float (float64) which leads to the comparison issue.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `hist` function to properly handle datetime inputs and avoid converting them to float.

Here's the corrected code for the `hist` function:

```python
import datetime
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# class declaration containing the buggy function
class Axes:
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def hist(self, x, bins=None, range=None, density=False, weights=None,
             cumulative=False, bottom=None, histtype='bar', align='mid',
             orientation='vertical', rwidth=None, log=False,
             color=None, label=None, stacked=False, **kwargs):
        # Properly handle datetime values without converting to float
        if isinstance(x[0][0], datetime.datetime):
            bins = mpl.dates.date2num(bins)
        
        # Rest of the function code
        # ...
```

In this corrected version, we handle `datetime` values before passing them to the `np.histogram` function. By converting the `bins` to be consistent with the `datetime` values, we avoid the comparison issues caused by mixing float and datetime types.
