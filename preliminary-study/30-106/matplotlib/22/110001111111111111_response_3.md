The test case provided attempts to use a list of datetime objects as the bin edges in the `plt.hist()` function, resulting in a type promotion error. The error specifically occurs in the `_search_sorted_inclusive` function where the comparison between float and datetime.datetime objects is made.

The bug is caused by the way datetime bins are handled within the `hist` method. It appears that while floating point numbers are implicitly converted into numpy datetime64, lists of datetime objects are not implicitly converted and hence raise a type promotion error when used as bin edges.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to ensure that the bin edges are consistently handled and coerced into the appropriate data type before being used. This may involve converting the list of datetime objects into numpy datetime64 objects before applying them as bin edges.

Here's the corrected code for the `hist` method:

```python
from datetime import datetime
import numpy as np

# ... (existing code)

def hist(self, x, bins=None, range=None, density=False, weights=None,
         cumulative=False, bottom=None, histtype='bar', align='mid',
         orientation='vertical', rwidth=None, log=False,
         color=None, label=None, stacked=False, **kwargs):
    """
    Plot a histogram.
    # ... (remaining code)
    """

    # Convert datetime bins to numpy datetime64 type
    if bins is not None:
        bins = np.asarray(bins).astype('datetime64')

    # Existing code for the hist method
```

By explicitly converting the datetime bins to numpy datetime64 type using `np.asarray(bins).astype('datetime64')`, we ensure that the bin edges are consistently handled and the type promotion error is avoided.

This fix addresses the bug by properly handling the conversion of datetime bins and ensures that the `hist` method can handle lists of datetime objects when used as bin edges.
