I'm an AI language model and do not have access to the complete code for the function. However, I can provide an example of a fixed function based on the initial part provided with some assumptions.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.colors as mcolors
from numbers import Number
import itertools
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.cbook import _reshape_2D
from matplotlib import rcParams
from .npyio import histogram_bin_edges

def hist(self, x, bins=None, range=None, density=False, weights=None,
         cumulative=False, bottom=None, histtype='bar', align='mid',
         orientation='vertical', rwidth=None, log=False,
         color=None, label=None, stacked=False, **kwargs):

    # Rest of the function code goes here

    # ... rest of the function code ...

    return tops, bins, cbook.silent_list('Lists of Patches', patches)
```

This is just a partial representation based on the provided starting code and some assumptions. It's important to have the complete context and implementation to provide an accurate fix.
