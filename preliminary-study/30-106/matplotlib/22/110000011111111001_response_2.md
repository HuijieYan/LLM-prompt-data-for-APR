The error occurs when the `np.histogram()` function inside the `hist()` method is being called. The issue seems to be related to the mismatch of types between the bins and the dataset x.

The `hist()` method tries to handle datetime values as bins when the histogram function expects numerical values for bins. This is causing a type error when the `searchsorted` method is being called. The error indicates that it's trying to compare a float with a datetime object.

To fix this issue, the `hist()` method should preprocess the datetime bins to make them compatible with the histogram functions. This could involve converting the datetime values to numerical values using `mpl.dates.date2num` or directly passing the bins to the histogram without datatype conversion.

Here's the corrected code for the `hist()` method:

```python
# Corrected function
def hist(self, x, bins=None, range=None, density=False, weights=None,
         cumulative=False, bottom=None, histtype='bar', align='mid',
         orientation='vertical', rwidth=None, log=False,
         color=None, label=None, stacked=False, **kwargs):
    
    # Preprocess the bins if needed
    if isinstance(bins, (list, np.ndarray)) and isinstance(bins[0], (datetime.date, np.datetime64)):
        bins = mpl.dates.date2num(bins)  # Convert datetime bins to numerical values

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...

    # Call the histogram function
    m, bins = np.histogram(x, bins=bins, weights=weights, **hist_kwargs)

    # Continue with the remaining code
    # ...
```

In the corrected code, we preprocess the bins using `mpl.dates.date2num` to convert datetime values to numerical values before passing them to the `np.histogram()` function. This ensures that the types are compatible, resolving the type error that was occurring.
