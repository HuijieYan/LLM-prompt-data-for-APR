# buggy class docstring

```text
The `Axes` contains most of the figure elements: `~.axis.Axis`,
`~.axis.Tick`, `~.lines.Line2D`, `~.text.Text`, `~.patches.Polygon`, etc.,
and sets the coordinate system.

The `Axes` instance supports callbacks through a callbacks attribute which
is a `~.cbook.CallbackRegistry` instance.  The events you can connect to
are 'xlim_changed' and 'ylim_changed' and the callback will be called with
func(*ax*) where *ax* is the `Axes` instance.

Attributes
----------
dataLim : `.Bbox`
    The bounding box enclosing all data displayed in the Axes.
viewLim : `.Bbox`
    The view limits in data coordinates.
```
