    Plot a histogram.

    Compute and draw the histogram of *x*. The return value is a tuple
    (*n*, *bins*, *patches*) or ([*n0*, *n1*, ...], *bins*, [*patches0*,
    *patches1*,...]) if the input contains multiple data. See the
    documentation of the *weights* parameter to draw a histogram of
    already-binned data.

    Multiple data can be provided via *x* as a list of datasets
    of potentially different length ([*x0*, *x1*, ...]), or as
    a 2-D ndarray in which each column is a dataset. Note that
    the ndarray form is transposed relative to the list form.

    Masked arrays are not supported.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : (n,) array or sequence of (n,) arrays
        Input values, this takes either a single array or a sequence of
        arrays which are not required to be of the same length.

    bins : int or sequence or str, optional
        If *bins* is an integer, it defines the number of equal-width bins
        in the range.

        If *bins* is a sequence, it defines the bin edges, including the
        left edge of the first bin and the right edge of the last bin;
        in this case, bins may be unequally spaced. All but the last
        (righthand-most) bin is half-open. In other words, if *bins* is::

            [1, 2, 3, 4]

        then the first bin is [1, 2) (including 1, but excluding 2) and
        the second [2, 3). The last bin, however, is [3, 4], which
        *includes* 4.

        If *bins* is a string, it is one of the binning strategies
        supported by `numpy.histogram_bin_edges`: 'auto', 'fd', 'doane',
        'scott', 'stone', 'rice', 'sturges', or 'sqrt'.

        The default is :rc:`hist.bins`.

    range : tuple or None, optional
        The lower and upper range of the bins. Lower and upper outliers
        are ignored. If not provided, *range* is (x.min(), x.max()).
        Range has no effect if *bins* is a sequence.

        If *bins* is a sequence or *range* is specified, autoscaling
        is based on the specified bin range instead of the
        range of x.

        Default is ``None``

    density : bool, optional
        If ``True``, the first element of the return tuple will
        be the counts normalized to form a probability density, i.e.,
        the area (or integral) under the histogram will sum to 1.
        This is achieved by dividing the count by the number of
        observations times the bin width and not dividing by the total
        number of observations. If *stacked* is also ``True``, the sum of
        the histograms is normalized to 1.

        Default is ``False``.

    weights : (n, ) array-like or None, optional
        An array of weights, of the same shape as *x*. Each value in *x*
        only contributes its associated weight towards the bin count
        (instead of 1). If *normed* or *density* is ``True``,
        the weights are normalized, so that the integral of the density
        over the range remains 1.

        Default is ``None``.

        This parameter can be used to draw a histogram of data that has
        already been binned, e.g. using `np.histogram` (by treating each
        bin as a single point with a weight equal to its count) ::

            counts, bins = np.histogram(data)
            plt.hist(bins[:-1], bins, weights=counts)

        (or you may alternatively use `~.bar()`).

    cumulative : bool or -1, optional
        If ``True``, then a histogram is computed where each bin gives the
        counts in that bin plus all bins for smaller values. The last bin
        gives the total number of datapoints.

        If *density* is also ``True`` then the histogram is normalized such
        that the last bin equals 1.

        If *cumulative* is a number less than 0 (e.g., -1), the direction
        of accumulation is reversed. In this case, if *density* is also
        ``True``, then the histogram is normalized such that the first bin
        equals 1.

        Default is ``False``

    Returns
    -------
    n : array or list of arrays
        The values of the histogram bins. See *density* and *weights* for a
        description of the possible semantics.  If input *x* is an array,
        then this is an array of length *nbins*. If input is a sequence of
        arrays ``[data1, data2, ...]``, then this is a list of arrays with
        the values of the histograms for each of the arrays in the same
        order.  The dtype of the array *n* (or of its element arrays) will
        always be float even if no weighting or normalization is used.

    bins : array
        The edges of the bins. Length nbins + 1 (nbins left edges and right
        edge of last bin).  Always a single array even when multiple data
        sets are passed in.

    patches : list or list of lists
        Silent list of individual patches used to create the histogram
        or list of such list if multiple input datasets.

    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    **kwargs : `~matplotlib.patches.Patch` properties
