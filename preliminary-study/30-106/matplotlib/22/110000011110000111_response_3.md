The error occurs because the `hist` function is not handling datetime objects correctly when used as bin edges. The error message indicates that the TypeError is raised due to the comparison between float and datetime.datetime instances.

The potential error location within the `hist` function seems to be in the `_search_sorted_inclusive` function, particularly in the `a.searchsorted(v[:-1], 'left')` line, where the error of comparing float and datetime objects is triggered.

The issue arises because the function fails to handle datetime objects correctly and erroneously attempts to perform a comparison with floats.

To fix the issue, it is necessary to ensure that the function handles datetime objects appropriately when used as bin edges.

Here's the corrected version of the `hist` method with the potential fix for the issue:

```python
def hist(self, x, bins=None, range=None, density=False, weights=None,
         cumulative=False, bottom=None, histtype='bar', align='mid',
         orientation='vertical', rwidth=None, log=False,
         color=None, label=None, stacked=False, **kwargs):
    # ... (other parts of the function)

    # Perform explicit bin edges conversion for datetime objects
    if isinstance(bins[0], datetime.datetime):
        bins = mpl.dates.date2num(bins)

    # continue with the rest of the function as is
```

The fix explicitly checks if the bin edges are instances of `datetime.datetime` and if so, converts them to floats using `mpl.dates.date2num` before proceeding with the rest of the function's logic. This fix should ensure that datetime objects used as bin edges are handled correctly, preventing the comparison error with floats.
