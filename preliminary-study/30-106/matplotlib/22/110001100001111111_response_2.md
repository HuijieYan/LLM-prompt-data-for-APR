The provided bug report indicates that there is a type promotion error related to datetime bins in the hist function of Matplotlib. The error occurs when attempting to use lists of date or datetime objects as bin edges, resulting in a TypeError.

Based on the error message, the issue appears to be related to the comparison of instances of 'float' and 'datetime.datetime', which suggests a problem with type conversion or comparison within the function.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely related to the handling and conversion of datetime objects when specifying the bins for the histogram.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug are related to the type promotion of datetime bins within the hist function. It seems that the function does not handle datetime bins correctly, leading to a type conversion error.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that datetime bins are properly handled and converted to a compatible format for comparison and histogram binning.

A possible approach for fixing the bug would involve modifying the internal handling of datetime bins within the hist function. This could include implementing explicit type conversion or ensuring that datetime bins are translated into an unambiguous format for comparison during histogram generation.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function with the suggested fix:

```python
# Corrected function for histogram with proper handling of datetime bins
def hist(self, x, bins=None, range=None, density=False, weights=None,
         cumulative=False, bottom=None, histtype='bar', align='mid',
         orientation='vertical', rwidth=None, log=False,
         color=None, label=None, stacked=False, **kwargs):
    """
    Plot a histogram.
    
    This is the corrected and updated version of the hist function with proper handling of datetime bins.
    """
    # Fix for handling datetime bins
    if bins is not None:
        if isinstance(bins, list) and all(isinstance(item, datetime.datetime) for item in bins):
            bins = mpl.dates.date2num(bins)  # Convert datetime bins to a compatible format
    # Remaining implementation of the function here...
```
In the corrected code, the if condition checks if the bins are a list of datetime objects, and then converts them to a compatible format for comparison and histogram binning, addressing the type promotion error related to datetime bins.
