The error is likely related to the `np.histogram` call inside the `hist` method, specifically the comparison of different data types, 'float' and 'datetime.datetime'.

The reason for the bug is that the histogram function is attempting to compare a floating-point number and a datetime object, which causes a TypeError.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `hist` method to handle datetime objects properly, ensuring that the comparison between datetime objects and floating-point numbers is not performed.

Here's the corrected `hist` method:

```python
def hist(self, x, bins=None, range=None, density=False, weights=None,
         cumulative=False, bottom=None, histtype='bar', align='mid',
         orientation='vertical', rwidth=None, log=False,
         color=None, label=None, stacked=False, **kwargs):
    """
    Plot a histogram.
    ...
    """

    if np.isscalar(x):
        x = [x]

    # ... (variable assignments and input validation)

    if bin_range is not None:
        bin_range = self.convert_xunits(bin_range)

    # ... (further processing)

    if weights is not None:
        w = cbook._reshape_2D(weights, 'weights')
    else:
        w = [None] * nx

    if len(w) != nx:
        raise ValueError('weights should have the same shape as x')

    for xi, wi in zip(x, w):
        if wi is not None and len(wi) != len(xi):
            raise ValueError('weights should have the same shape as x')

    if color is None:
        color = [self._get_lines.get_next_color() for i in range(nx)]
    else:
        color = mcolors.to_rgba_array(color)
        if len(color) != nx:
            error_message = (
                "color kwarg must have one color per data set. %d data "
                "sets and %d colors were provided" % (nx, len(color)))
            raise ValueError(error_message)

    hist_kwargs = dict()

    # if the bin_range is not given, compute without nan numpy
    # does not do this for us when guessing the range (but will
    # happily ignore nans when computing the histogram).
    if bin_range is None:
        xmin = np.inf
        xmax = -np.inf
        for xi in x:
            if len(xi):
                # python's min/max ignore nan,
                # np.minnan returns nan for all nan input
                xmin = min(xmin, np.nanmin(xi))
                xmax = max(xmax, np.nanmax(xi))
        # make sure we have seen at least one non-nan and finite
        # value before we reset the bin range
        if not np.isnan([xmin, xmax]).any() and not (xmin > xmax):
            bin_range = (xmin, xmax)

    # ... (rest of the implementation)

    return tops, bins, cbook.silent_list('Lists of Patches', patches)  # Return values
```

By updating the `hist` method as shown, the issue related to the comparison of datetime objects and floating-point numbers would be resolved. The modified `hist` method should now be able to handle datetime data properly without causing any type errors.
