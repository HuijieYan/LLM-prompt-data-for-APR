The test case `test_hist_datetime_datasets_bins` is intended to test the behavior of the `hist` method for the case of datetime data. The error occurs when the `hist` method is called with the `data` and `date_edges` as input, resulting in a TypeError related to comparing float and datetime.datetime instances.

The potential error location within the `hist` method is likely to be in the calculation of the histogram using the `np.histogram` function. The `np.histogram` function internally uses the `searchsorted` method to compute the histogram, and this is where the comparison between float and datetime instances is causing the TypeError.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the `np.histogram` function internally uses the `searchsorted` method to locate the bins for the histogram calculation. The `searchsorted` method does not handle comparisons between float and datetime instances, leading to the TypeError.

To fix the bug, we need to preprocess the datetime data before passing it to the `np.histogram` function, ensuring that it can handle the datetime instances correctly during the binning process.

Here's the corrected code for the `hist` method with the necessary changes applied:

```python
# ... (other code)

# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@_preprocess_data(replace_names=["x", 'weights'], label_namer="x")
def hist(self, x, bins=None, range=None, density=False, weights=None,
         cumulative=False, bottom=None, histtype='bar', align='mid',
         orientation='vertical', rwidth=None, log=False,
         color=None, label=None, stacked=False, **kwargs):
    """
    Plot a histogram.

    # Previous code remains unchanged

    """
    # ... (other code)

    if np.isscalar(x):
        x = [x]

    # Preprocess datetime data
    if isinstance(x[0][0], datetime.datetime):
        x = [mpl.dates.date2num(xi) for xi in x]

    # ... (remaining code)
```

In the corrected code, we preprocess the `x` data by converting datetime instances to numerical values using `mpl.dates.date2num` before passing it to the `np.histogram` function. This ensures that the datetime instances are handled appropriately during the histogram calculation process, resolving the TypeError issue.
