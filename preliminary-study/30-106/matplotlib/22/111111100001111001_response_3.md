The detected bug is in the `hist` method of the `Axes` class. When the method is called, the `hist` method is setting `bin_range` to a range of datetime objects. Later on, it's trying to multiply the `bin_range` to get `totwidth`. 

Based on the provided values and output, it seems that the error is occurring because, later in the code, the `bin_range` tuple is being used for arithmetic operations, which is not appropriate for datetime objects.

To fix this bug, you need to ensure that the `bin_range` is of numerical value before using it for further arithmetic operations. Additionally, you may need to refactor the function to handle datetime object ranges appropriately if that is desired functionality.

Here's the corrected code for the `hist` method:

```python
import numpy as np

...

def hist(self, x, bins=None, bin_range=None, density=False, weights=None, cumulative=False, bottom=None, histtype='bar', align='mid', orientation='vertical', rwidth=None, log=False, color=None, label=None, stacked=False, **kwargs):
    # ... (rest of the function as provided)

    if bin_range is not None and isinstance(bin_range[0], (int, float)) and isinstance(bin_range[1], (int, float)):
        bin_range = np.nan_to_num(bin_range)

    if np.isscalar(x):
        x = [x]

    if bins is None:
        bins = rcParams['hist.bins']

    # ... (rest of the function as provided)
```

In this corrected code, we use `isinstance` checks to ensure that the `bin_range` is numerical, and then utilize `np.nan_to_num` to handle any potential `NaN` values. This way, we ensure that the `bin_range` is appropriately processed for later arithmetic operations.
