The bug is caused by the fact that the `bins` argument is not being converted to a float implicitly when the input data contains datetime objects. This results in a comparison error between `float` and `datetime.datetime` instances.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `bins` argument is converted to a float using `mpl.dates.date2num` to align with the datetime data being passed. This will allow for a proper comparison and prevent the TypeError from occurring.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def hist(self, x, bins=None, range=None, density=False, weights=None,
             cumulative=False, bottom=None, histtype='bar', align='mid',
             orientation='vertical', rwidth=None, log=False,
             color=None, label=None, stacked=False, **kwargs):
        # ... omitted code ...

        if bins is not None:
            if isinstance(bins, (list, np.ndarray)):
                bins = mpl.dates.date2num(bins)

        # ... omitted code ...
```

In this corrected code, after checking if `bins` is not None and is a list or NumPy array, we convert the `bins` to floats using `mpl.dates.date2num`. This ensures that the `bins` are compatible with the datetime data being provided, preventing the comparison error.
