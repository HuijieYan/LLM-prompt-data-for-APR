The error occurs when the `hist` function is called with the `datetime` data and bin edges, and the `bins` parameter is processed using a custom `bins_preprocess` function. This function modifies the bin edges to a different format (e.g., converts datetimes to numerical values using `mpl.dates.date2num`), which may lead to unexpected behavior within the `hist` function.

The issue seems to arise when the `np.histogram` function is trying to execute `_search_sorted_inclusive` internally to compute the histogram buckets. The error states that there is a `TypeError` with the comparison of instances of `float` and `datetime.datetime`.

This error is likely because the bin edges have been preprocessed into a format that doesn't align with the expected format for bin edges within `np.histogram`. The preprocessing should ensure that the bin edges are in a format that can be correctly handled by `np.histogram`.

A possible approach to fixing this bug is to make sure that the bin edges are appropriately preprocessed before being passed to the `np.histogram` function. Also, ensure that the bins and data passed to `np.histogram` are of the same format.

Here's the corrected code for the `hist` function:

```python
def hist(self, x, bins=None, range=None, density=False, weights=None,
         cumulative=False, bottom=None, histtype='bar', align='mid',
         orientation='vertical', rwidth=None, log=False,
         color=None, label=None, stacked=False, **kwargs):
    # previous code ...

    if bins is not None:
        bins = bins_preprocess(bins)  # preprocess the bin edges

    # ... remaining code ...
```

By directly preprocessing the bin edges within the `hist` function before using them in the `np.histogram` call, we can ensure that the bin edges and data are in compatible formats, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring.
