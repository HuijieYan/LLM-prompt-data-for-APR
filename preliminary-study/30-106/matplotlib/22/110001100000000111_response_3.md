Potential Error Location:
The error is likely occurring in the `hist` method of the provided `axes` class. Specifically, it seems to be related to the handling of datetime objects as bin edges when calling the `plt.hist()` method.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by the method not handling datetime objects correctly when used as bin edges. The error message "<'<' not supported between instances of 'float' and 'datetime.datetime'>" indicates that there is a comparison error between float and datetime objects, which suggests that the method is not handling datetime objects appropriately.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that datetime objects are properly handled when used as bin edges in the `hist` method.
2. Convert datetime objects to numerical values before performing any comparisons or operations with them.

Corrected Code:
```python
from datetime import datetime
import numpy as np

def hist(self, x, bins=None, range=None, density=False, weights=None,
         cumulative=False, bottom=None, histtype='bar', align='mid',
         orientation='vertical', rwidth=None, log=False,
         color=None, label=None, stacked=False, **kwargs):
    # Corrected code goes here
    if isinstance(bins, list) and all(isinstance(item, datetime) for item in bins):
        bins = np.array([mpl.dates.date2num(item) for item in bins])
    
    # Rest of the method remains unchanged
```
In the corrected code, we check if the `bins` input is a list of datetime objects, and if so, we convert it to numerical values using `mpl.dates.date2num`. This ensures that the bin edges are handled correctly even when using datetime objects.
