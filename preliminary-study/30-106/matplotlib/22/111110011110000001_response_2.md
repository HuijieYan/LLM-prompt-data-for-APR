The test function `test_hist_datetime_datasets_bins` calls the `hist` method of an `Axes` object, passing a list of datetime objects as the `data` argument and a lambda function `bins_preprocess` as the `bins` argument. The lambda function converts the datetime objects to numerical values using the `date2num` method from the `matplotlib.dates` module.

The error message indicates a `TypeError` within the `numpy/lib/histograms.py` file, specifically in the `_search_sorted_inclusive` function. This error is caused by a comparison between a float and a datetime object.

The potential error location within the `hist` method is most likely in the part where the `numpy.histogram` function is called, as this is where the error message originates. The `numpy.histogram` function is being passed the `x` argument (which contains datetime objects) and the `bins` argument (which is the lambda function's result). This could potentially result in a comparison between a float and a datetime object.

The bug occurred because the `hist` method did not handle the conversion of datetime objects correctly when the `bins` argument was processed. The lambda function was used to convert the datetime objects, but the `hist` method did not account for this conversion.

To fix the bug, the `hist` method should handle the conversion of datetime objects properly. It should ensure that the datetime objects are correctly converted to numerical values before being used with the `numpy.histogram` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `hist` method:

```python
def hist(self, x, bins=None, range=None, density=False, weights=None,
         cumulative=False, bottom=None, histtype='bar', align='mid',
         orientation='vertical', rwidth=None, log=False,
         color=None, label=None, stacked=False, **kwargs):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # Process datetime objects if bins_preprocess is a function
    if callable(bins):
        if isinstance(x[0], (datetime.datetime, np.datetime64)):
            x = [bins(xi) for xi in x]

    m, bins = np.histogram(x, bins=bins, weights=weights, **hist_kwargs)
    # ... remaining code ...

    return m, bins, cbook.silent_list('Patch', patches)
```

In the corrected code, a check is added to determine if the `bins` argument requires preprocessing (if it's a function). If so, and if the data contain datetime objects, the `bins` preprocessing function is applied to each element of the `x` data before using it in the `numpy.histogram` function.
