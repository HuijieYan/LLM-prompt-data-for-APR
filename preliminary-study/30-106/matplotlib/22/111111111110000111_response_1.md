The error is caused by the inability of `plt.hist` to handle datetime objects when used as bin edges. 

The issue arises because the `np.histogram` function in the `hist` method of the `Axes` class does not handle datetime bins effectively. This results in an error stating that the comparison between float and datetime objects is not supported.

To fix this bug, the `hist` method should handle datetime bins appropriately, allowing for the usage of datetime objects without encountering type promotion errors.

The corrected `hist` method is as follows:

```python
def hist(self, x, bins=10, range=None, density=None, weights=None,
         cumulative=False, bottom=None, histtype='bar', align='mid',
         orientation='vertical', rwidth=None, log=False,
         color=None, label=None, stacked=False, **kwargs):
    """
    Input arguments and function implementation
    """
    # Add corrected implementation for handling datetime bins


    try:
        m, bins = np.histogram(x, bins, range, weights, density)
    except TypeError as e:
        if "imply comparison" in str(e):
            bins = mpl.dates.date2num(bins)
            m, bins = np.histogram(x, bins, range, weights, density)
        else:
            raise

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
    # ...

    return m, bins, patches
```

In this corrected implementation, the `np.histogram` function is wrapped in a `try-except` block to handle datetime bins appropriately. If a type promotion error is encountered, the bins are converted using `mpl.dates.date2num` before calling `np.histogram` again.

This approach should resolve the type promotion error related to datetime bins when using the `hist` method in matplotlib.
