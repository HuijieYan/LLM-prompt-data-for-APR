The test case is aimed at testing the histogram generation for datetime datasets with specific date edges. The error occurs when the `hist` function tries to compute the histogram using `np.histogram`. The error message indicates that there is a problem with the comparison between a float and a datetime value, which is likely happening inside the `np.histogram` function.

The issue is most likely caused by the expected input format for the `bins` parameter of the `np.histogram` function. Given the nature of the error, it seems like the `bins` parameter is expected to be in a format that can be correctly compared to the datetime values present in the input dataset.

To resolve this issue, it would be necessary to provide the `bins` parameter in a format that is compatible with the datetime values. This might involve preprocessing the `date_edges` using the `bins_preprocess` function provided as a parameter in the test case.

The corrected code for the `hist` function is shown below:

```python
def hist(self, x, bins=None, *args, **kwargs):
    if isinstance(x[0], datetime.datetime):
        bins = mpl.dates.date2num(bins)  # Preprocessing date edges
    m, bins = np.histogram(x[i], bins, **kwargs)
    # ...rest of the function...
    return m, bins, cbook.silent_list('Patch', patches[0])
```

In this corrected code:
- I assumed that the `date_edges` should be preprocessed using the provided `bins_preprocess` function.
- I used the histogram generation without explicitly handling date values, assuming that the processed `date_edges` will be compatible with the datetime values in the dataset.
