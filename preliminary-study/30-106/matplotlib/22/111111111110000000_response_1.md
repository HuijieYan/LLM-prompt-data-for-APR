    """
    The `Axes` contains most of the figure elements: `~.axis.Axis`,
    `~.axis.Tick`, `~.lines.Line2D`, `~.text.Text`, `~.patches.Polygon`, etc.,
    and sets the coordinate system.
    
    The `Axes` instance supports callbacks through a callbacks attribute which
    is a `~.cbook.CallbackRegistry` instance.  The events you can connect to
    are 'xlim_changed' and 'ylim_changed' and the callback will be called with
    func(*ax*) where *ax* is the `Axes` instance.
    
    Attributes
    ----------
    dataLim : `.Bbox`
        The bounding box enclosing all data displayed in the Axes.
    viewLim : `.Bbox`
        The view limits in data coordinates.

        Plot a histogram.
    
        Compute and draw the histogram of *x*.  The return value is a tuple
        (*n*, *bins*, *patches*) or ([*n0*, *n1*, ...], *bins*, [*patches0*,
        *patches1*,...]) if the input contains multiple data.  See the
        documentation of the *weights* parameter to draw a histogram of
        already-binned data.
    
        Multiple data can be provided via *x* as a list of datasets
        of potentially different length ([*x0*, *x1*, ...]), or as
        a 2-D ndarray in which each column is a dataset.  Note that
        the ndarray form is transposed relative to the list form.
    
        Masked arrays are not supported.
    
        The *bins*, *range*, *weights*, and *density* parameters behave as in
        `numpy.histogram`.
    
        Parameters
        ----------
        x : (n,) array or sequence of (n,) arrays
            Input values, this takes either a single array or a sequence of
            arrays which are not required to be of the same length.
    
            # ... remaining parameter descriptions ...

        Returns
        -------
        n : array or list of arrays
            The values of the histogram bins. See *density* and *weights* for a
            description of the possible semantics.  If input *x* is an array,
            then this is an array of length *nbins*. If input is a sequence of
            arrays ``[data1, data2, ...]``, then this is a list of arrays with
            the values of the histograms for each of the arrays in the same
            order.  The dtype of the array *n* (or of its element arrays) will
            always be float even if no weighting or normalization is used.
