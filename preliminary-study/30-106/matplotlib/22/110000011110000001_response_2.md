The error occurs in the `ax.hist` call, specifically when calling `np.histogram` inside the `hist` function. The error message indicates that there is a TypeError because the comparison operator '<' is not supported between instances of 'float' and 'datetime.datetime'.

The potential location of the bug is within the `hist` function where different data types are being compared or used in a way that leads to the TypeError when calculating the histogram.

The reason behind this bug is that the data provided to the `hist` function contains elements of type 'datetime.datetime', while the internal comparison operations or calculations performed by `np.histogram` involve operations that are not directly compatible with elements of type 'datetime.datetime'.

To fix the bug, the comparison and operations within the `hist` function need to be handled differently when dealing with input data of type 'datetime.datetime'. There should be a specific handling for datetime objects to ensure that the operations are compatible with this data type.

The corrected function code with the fix is provided below:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.dates as mpl_dates

def hist(self, x, bins=None, range=None, density=False, weights=None,
         cumulative=False, bottom=None, histtype='bar', align='mid',
         orientation='vertical', rwidth=None, log=False,
         color=None, label=None, stacked=False, **kwargs):
    # existing code

    for xi, wi in zip(x, w):
        if wi is not None and len(wi) != len(xi):
            raise ValueError(
                'weights should have the same shape as x')

    for i in range(nx):
        if isinstance(x[i][0], mpl_dates.date2num):
            x[i] = mpl_dates.date2num(x[i])

    if isinstance(bin_range[0], mpl_dates.date2num):
        bin_range = (mpl_dates.date2num(bin_range[0]), mpl_dates.date2num(bin_range[1]))

    # existing code

    for patch in patches:
        for p in patch[1:]:
            p.update(kwargs)
            p.set_label('_nolegend_')

    # existing code

    if nx == 1:
        return tops[0], bins, cbook.silent_list('Patch', patches[0])
    else:
        return tops, bins, cbook.silent_list('Lists of Patches', patches)
```

In the corrected code:
- The dates in the input data are converted to matplotlib numbers using `mpl_dates.date2num` to ensure compatibility with the calculations in `np.histogram`.
- Also, the range of dates is converted to matplotlib numbers if necessary.
- This ensures that the input data for the histogram calculations is always in a compatible format, resolving the TypeError issue.
