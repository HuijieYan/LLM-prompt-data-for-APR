The error message indicates that the images are not close, with an RMS value of 6.526. This suggests that the expected and actual images are not matching, which is likely due to incorrect rendering of the polar plot with the r-origin set.

The issue description from the GitHub report also corresponds to this unexpected behavior. It mentions that setting r-origin manually does not work as expected when saving the plot as a PNG, while it works with other formats such as PDF or when using the UI interactively.

Given the details provided, the bug is likely to be located in the `draw` function of the `PolarAxes` class, particularly in the calculation and application of the r-origin.

The draw function should correctly calculate the required attributes, including rmin and rmax, as well as center, radius, and width for the Wedge patch when the patch is an instance of a Wedge. The function should take into account the r-origin and r-sign to properly render the polar plot.

To fix the bug, you need to ensure that the r-origin is correctly calculated and applied when determining the patches and attributes of the polar plot. Additionally, verify that the subsequent visibility settings for the spines and y-axis text are adjusted based on the r-origin and r-sign.

Here is the corrected version of the `draw` function in the `PolarAxes` class:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def draw(self, renderer, *args, **kwargs):
    thetamin, thetamax = np.rad2deg(self._realViewLim.intervalx)
    if thetamin > thetamax:
        thetamin, thetamax = thetamax, thetamin
    rmin_orig = self.get_rorigin()  # Get the original r-origin
    rmin, rmax = ((self._realViewLim.intervaly - rmin_orig) * self.get_rsign())  # Calculate rmin and rmax using the original r-origin

    if isinstance(self.patch, mpatches.Wedge):
        center = self.transWedge.transform((0.5, 0.5))
        self.patch.set_center(center)
        self.patch.set_theta1(thetamin)
        self.patch.set_theta2(thetamax)

        # Adjust the radius and width based on rorigin
        r_delta = rmax - rmin_orig  # Calculate the delta between rmax and the original r-origin
        radius = max(0, self.projection.r_max - rmin)  # Adapt the radius calculation based on rmin
        width = self.projection.r_max - min(rmax, rmin_orig)  # Adapt the width based on rmax and the original r-origin
        self.patch.set_radius(radius)
        self.patch.set_width(width)

        inner_width = radius - width
        inner = self.spines.get('inner', None)
        if inner:
            inner.set_visible(inner_width != 0.0)

    visible = not _is_full_circle_deg(thetamin, thetamax)
    start = self.spines.get('start', None)
    end = self.spines.get('end', None)
    if start:
        start.set_visible(visible)
    if end:
        end.set_visible(visible)
    if visible:
        yaxis_text_transform = self._yaxis_transform
    else:
        yaxis_text_transform = self._r_label_position + self.transData
    if self._yaxis_text_transform != yaxis_text_transform:
        self._yaxis_text_transform.set(yaxis_text_transform)
        self.yaxis.reset_ticks()
        self.yaxis.set_clip_path(self.patch)

    Axes.draw(self, renderer, *args, **kwargs)
```

Applying these changes should address the issue of rendering the polar plot with the r-origin set and ensure that the images will match the expected output provided in the test case.
