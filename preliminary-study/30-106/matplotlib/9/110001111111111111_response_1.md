This bug seems to be causing the incorrect rendering of a polar plot when saving it as a PNG, specifically when the rorigin is set. The bug may be located near the calculations for the rmin and rmax values.

Upon analyzing the provided function, it seems that the calculation for rmin and rmax is likely incorrect. This can lead to incorrect rendering of the polar plot, especially when using the set_rorigin method.

The bug occurs due to the incorrect calculation of rmin and rmax based on self._realViewLim.intervaly, as well as the improper use of the get_rorigin() and get_rsign() methods.

To fix this bug, the calculation for rmin and rmax should be adjusted based on the correct usage of the methods get_rorigin() and get_rsign(). Additionally, the conditions for setting the inner and spines visibility should be reviewed to ensure correct behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def draw(self, renderer, *args, **kwargs):
    thetamin, thetamax = np.rad2deg(self._realViewLim.intervalx)
    if thetamin > thetamax:
        thetamin, thetamax = thetamax, thetamin
    rmin = self.get_rorigin()
    rmax = self._realViewLim.intervaly * self.get_rsign() + rmin

    # Remaining code for drawing the polar plot...

    Axes.draw(self, renderer, *args, **kwargs)
```
In this corrected code, the calculations for rmin and rmax are fixed to use the get_rorigin() and get_rsign() methods without unnecessary calculations. Additionally, the logic for setting the visibility of the inner and spines is to be reviewed.
