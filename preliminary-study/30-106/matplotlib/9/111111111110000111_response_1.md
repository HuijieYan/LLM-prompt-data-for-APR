1. The test case involves creating a polar plot with inverted y-axis limits and setting a custom r-origin. The test then tries to save this plot as a PNG and compares it to an expected PNG. However, the images are not close, and the Root Mean Square (RMS) error is reported as 6.526. This indicates a discrepancy between the expected and actual images.

2. The potential error location is within the `draw` method of the `PolarAxes` class. It appears that setting a custom r-origin is causing issues when rendering the polar plot as a PNG, leading to the failure of the test case.

3. The bug is likely occurring because the custom r-origin is not being handled correctly in the `draw` method, resulting in an incorrect rendering of the polar plot when saving as a PNG.

4. To fix the bug, the `draw` method of the `PolarAxes` class needs to be adjusted to properly handle the custom r-origin when rendering the polar plot. This may involve ensuring that the r-origin transformation is correctly applied to the plot elements before rendering.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `draw` method of the `PolarAxes` class:

```python
def draw(self, renderer):
    thetamin, thetamax = np.rad2deg(self._realViewLim.intervalx)
    if thetamin > thetamax:
        thetamin, thetamax = thetamax, thetamin
    rmin, rmax = ((self._realViewLim.intervaly - self.get_rorigin()) *
                  self.get_rsign())
    if isinstance(self.patch, mpatches.Wedge):
        center = self.transWedge.transform((0.5, 0.5))
        self.patch.set_center(center)
        self.patch.set_theta1(thetamin)
        self.patch.set_theta2(thetamax)

        edge, _ = self.transWedge.transform((1, 0))
        radius = edge - center[0]
        width = min(radius * (rmax - rmin) / rmax, radius)
        self.patch.set_radius(radius)
        self.patch.set_width(width)

        inner_width = radius - width
        inner = self.spines.get('inner', None)
        if inner:
            inner.set_visible(inner_width != 0.0)

    visible = not _is_full_circle_deg(thetamin, thetamax)
    start = self.spines.get('start', None)
    end = self.spines.get('end', None)
    if start:
        start.set_visible(visible)
    if end:
        end.set_visible(visible)
    if visible:
        yaxis_text_transform = self._yaxis_transform
    else:
        yaxis_text_transform = self._r_label_position + self.transData
    if self._yaxis_text_transform != yaxis_text_transform:
        self._yaxis_text_transform.set(yaxis_text_transform)
        self.yaxis.reset_ticks()
        self.yaxis.set_clip_path(self.patch)

    super().draw(renderer)
``` 

This code snippet addresses the potential issues by properly applying the r-origin and r-sign transformations to the plot elements before rendering. This should ensure that custom r-origins are handled correctly when saving the polar plot as a PNG.
