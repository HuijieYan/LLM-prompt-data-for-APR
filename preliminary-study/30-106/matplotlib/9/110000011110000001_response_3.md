The error message indicates that the images produced by the test function "test_polar_invertedylim_rorigin" do not match the expected images. This suggests that there could be a problem with the drawing of the polar plot, possibly related to the transformation or origin settings.

Upon analyzing the provided code, it appears that the potential error may be related to the `draw` method of the `PolarAxes` class. The method is attempting to set the center, theta1, theta2, radius, and width of a wedge patch based on certain parameters. However, there are inconsistencies in the code that may lead to incorrect patch properties or transformation issues.

The bug is likely caused by the incorrect calculation of `rmin` and `rmax` in the `draw` method, as well as issues with center and radius calculations.

To fix the bug, the following changes can be made to the `draw` method of the `PolarAxes` class:

```python
def draw(self, renderer, *args, **kwargs):
    thetamin, thetamax = np.rad2deg(self._realViewLim.intervalx)
    if thetamin > thetamax:
        thetamin, thetamax = thetamax, thetamin

    # Correct calculation of rmin and rmax
    rmin = self._realViewLim.intervaly.start - self.get_rorigin()
    rmax = self._realViewLim.intervaly.stop - self.get_rorigin()

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
```

With these corrections, the `draw` method should now correctly calculate the values of `rmin` and `rmax`, and set the properties of the wedge patch accordingly. This should address the inconsistency in the polar plot drawing and resolve the error encountered in the test function.
