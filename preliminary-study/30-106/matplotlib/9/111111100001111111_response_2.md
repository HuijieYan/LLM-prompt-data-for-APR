The issue appears to be related to setting the r-origin in a polar plot and then saving it as a png. The problem does not occur when saving as a PDF or using the UI to save it as a png.

Looking at the provided bug report, the issue arises when setting the r-origin using the `ax_g.set_rorigin(-78)` line. This suggests that there might be a bug in the implementation of the `set_rorigin` method.

Based on the given information, the problem might be related to the calculation of the radius (`rmax`) and width (`width`) within the `draw` method of the `PolarAxes` class. There might be an inconsistency in how the radius and width are calculated when the r-origin is set manually, causing the issue when the plot is saved as a png.

To address this issue, the calculations for `rmax` and `width` in the `draw` method need to be reviewed to ensure that they accurately reflect the impact of setting the r-origin. Additionally, the installation and configuration of the backend (e.g., Agg, TkAgg) should be reviewed to verify that it is compatible with handling the r-origin setting in polar plots.

Below is the corrected code for the `draw` method in the `PolarAxes` class:

```python
def draw(self, renderer, *args, **kwargs):
    thetamin, thetamax = np.rad2deg(self._realViewLim.intervalx)
    if thetamin > thetamax:
        thetamin, thetamax = thetamax, thetamin
    
    rmin, rmax = ((self._realViewLim.intervaly - self.get_rorigin()) *
                  self.get_rsign())
    
    if rmin > rmax:
        rmin, rmax = rmax, rmin
    
    if isinstance(self.patch, mpatches.Wedge):
        # Update center and angular span based on thetamin and thetamax
        center = self.transWedge.transform((0.5, 0.5))
        self.patch.set_center(center)
        self.patch.set_theta1(thetamin)
        self.patch.set_theta2(thetamax)
    
        # Update radius and width based on rmin and rmax
        edge, _ = self.transWedge.transform((1, 0))
        radius = edge - center[0]
        width = min(radius * (rmax - rmin) / rmax, radius)
        self.patch.set_radius(radius)
        self.patch.set_width(width)
    
        # Update inner width and visibility
        inner_width = radius - width
        inner = self.spines.get('inner', None)
        if inner:
            inner.set_visible(inner_width != 0.0)
    
    # Rest of the method remains unchanged
    visible = not _is_full_circle_deg(thetamin, thetamax)
    start = self.spines.get('start', None)
    end = self.spines.get('end', None)
    if start:
        start.set_visible(visible)
    if end:
        end.set_visible(visible)
    if visible:
        yaxis_text_transform = self._yaxis_transform
    else:
        yaxis_text_transform = self._r_label_position + self.transData
    if self._yaxis_text_transform != yaxis_text_transform:
        self._yaxis_text_transform.set(yaxis_text_transform)
        self.yaxis.reset_ticks()
        self.yaxis.set_clip_path(self.patch)
    
    Axes.draw(self, renderer, *args, **kwargs)
```

By updating the radius and width calculation part and considering the impact of the r-origin setting, the corrected code aims to resolve the issue with saving polar plots as png when the r-origin is manually set.
