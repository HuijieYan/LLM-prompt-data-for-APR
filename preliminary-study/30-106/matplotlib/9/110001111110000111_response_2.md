The error message indicates that there is a problem with the rendering of a polar plot with the r-origin set. The associated GitHub issue also describes a similar problem with saving a png of a polar plot when the r-origin is set. 

From the error message, it seems that the issue is related to the rendering of the polar plot when the r-origin is set and the plot is saved as a png. This suggests that the problem might be within the draw function, specifically within the block of code related to setting the r-origin and rendering the plot.

The bug is likely occurring because the code related to setting the r-origin and rendering the plot is not functioning as expected when the plot is saved as a png. This could be due to an issue with the calculation of the plot elements when the r-origin is set.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to review the code related to setting the r-origin and the rendering of the polar plot. This might involve debugging the draw function and checking the calculations related to the r-origin and the rendering of the plot elements.

Below is the corrected code for the draw function:

```python
def draw(self, renderer):
    thetamin, thetamax = np.rad2deg(self._realViewLim.intervalx)
    if thetamin > thetamax:
        thetamin, thetamax = thetamax, thetamin
    rmin, rmax = ((self._realViewLim.intervaly - self.get_rorigin()) * self.get_rsign())
    if isinstance(self.patch, mpatches.Wedge):
        # Backwards-compatibility: Any subclassed Axes might override the
        # patch to not be the Wedge that PolarAxes uses.
        center = self.transWedge.transform((0.5, 0.5))
        self.patch.set_center(center)
        self.patch.set_theta1(thetamin)
        self.patch.set_theta2(thetamax)

        edge, _ = self.transWedge.transform((1, 0))
        radius = edge - center[0]
        width = min(radius * (rmax - rmin) / rmax, radius)
        self.patch.set_radius(radius)
        self.patch.set_width(width)

        inner_width = radius - width
        inner = self.spines.get('inner', None)
        if inner:
            inner.set_visible(inner_width != 0.0)

    visible = not _is_full_circle_deg(thetamin, thetamax)
    # For backwards compatibility, any subclassed Axes might override the
    # spines to not include start/end that PolarAxes uses.
    start = self.spines.get('start', None)
    end = self.spines.get('end', None)
    if start:
        start.set_visible(visible)
    if end:
        end.set_visible(visible)
    if visible:
        yaxis_text_transform = self._yaxis_transform
    else:
        yaxis_text_transform = self._r_label_position + self.transData
    if self._yaxis_text_transform != yaxis_text_transform:
        self._yaxis_text_transform.set(yaxis_text_transform)
        self.yaxis.reset_ticks()
        self.yaxis.set_clip_path(self.patch)

    Axes.draw(self, renderer)
```
Note that the arguments `*args` and `**kwargs` have been removed from the function signature as they were not being used within the function.
