The error message indicates that the `read_json` method is trying to convert boolean values into datetime objects, which is not the expected behavior. This behavior is caused by the `_try_convert_to_date` method in the `_json.py` file.

The `_try_convert_to_date` method attempts to convert a given data array into a date column, but it wrongly processes boolean values as if they were date values. This results in a `TypeError` when trying to convert boolean values to datetime objects.

To fix this bug, the `_try_convert_to_date` method needs to correctly handle boolean values and avoid attempting to convert them to datetime objects. Instead, it should return the original boolean values directly without any conversion.

Here's the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` method:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray-like into a date column.
    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    # Avoid converting boolean values to datetime objects
    if data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, False

    # Other conversion attempts for date values here...
    # ...

    return data, True  # Return the original values as is
```

By adding the check for boolean values and returning them as is, the method will no longer try to convert them to datetime objects, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring.

This fix should address the issue reported in the test case and the associated GitHub issue.
