Potential error location: 

The potential error is occurring in the section that checks for object type and attempts to coerce it to int64. There also appears to be an issue with data type checking and handling of date units.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:

The bug is occurring due to incorrect handling of different data types and date units. Additionally, the logic for checking if the data is in range is not correctly implemented.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

1. Use numpy's inbuilt functions to handle data type conversions, such as `np.datetime64`.
2. Correctly handle the logic for checking if the data is in range based on the date unit.
3. Handle date units more systematically and accurately to ensure successful conversion.

Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse an ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_datetime(data, infer_datetime_format=True, errors='coerce')
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if np.issubdtype(new_data.dtype, np.number):
        in_range = (
            pd.isnull(new_data)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    for date_unit in [self.date_unit] if self.date_unit else ['ns', 'us', 'ms', 's', 'm', 'h', 'D']:
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors='raise', unit=date_unit)
            return new_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue

    return data, False
