The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` takes in input data and tries to parse it into a date column. However, the function has multiple issues that need to be addressed:

1. The `astype` method is used on the variable `data`, but the result is not assigned back to `new_data`. This means that the original data is being used instead of the converted data.
2. The comparison with `self.min_stamp` and the usage of `iNaT` are unclear, and it's assumed that these variables are defined elsewhere in the class `Parser`.
3. It's unclear what `isna` and `to_datetime` represent, and it's assumed that these are functions or methods that are accessible within the scope of the `Parser` class.

Given these considerations, here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, to_datetime, iNaT, RangeIndex, Series

class Parser:
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
    
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
    
        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if isinstance(new_data, (RangeIndex, Series)):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return new_data, False
    
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else ('s', 'ms', 'us', 'ns')
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return new_data, False
```

In the corrected code:
- The `data.astype("int64")` method call now assigns the result back to `new_data`.
- The comparison logic for `new_data` has been updated considering that it might be a `RangeIndex` or a `Series`.
- The expected `date_unit` is assigned to `date_units` directly in the absence of `self.date_unit`. This is done to ensure that the code does not rely on another undefined variable `self._STAMP_UNITS`.
