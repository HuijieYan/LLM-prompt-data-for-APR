The issue occurs in the `_try_convert_to_date` method, where the code is attempting to convert boolean data to a date format. This results in the unexpected behavior of returning a series of timestamps instead of a series of booleans.

To fix this issue, the specific code block that attempts to coerce object data to int64 and then convert it to a date needs to be modified. The correct approach is to check the data type before trying to convert it. If the data type is boolean, it should not be converted to a date.

Here's the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` method:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas._libs.tslibs.nattype import NaT
from pandas import RangeIndex, SeriesParser, to_datetime

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if isinstance(data, (RangeIndex, SeriesParser)):
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if isinstance(new_data.dtype, np.number):
        in_range = (
            new_data == iNaT
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    return new_data, False
```

With this correction, the method will correctly handle boolean data and return a series of booleans instead of attempting to convert them to dates.
