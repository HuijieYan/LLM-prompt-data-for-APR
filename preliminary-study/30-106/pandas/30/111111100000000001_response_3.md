Based on the function provided, it seems to be attempting to convert data into a date column by trying to parse it. However, there are a few issues with the current implementation:

1. The variable `new_data` is being assigned the same value as `data` initially, and then being reassigned later in the function. This could lead to unexpected behavior.
2. The `self.min_stamp` and `iNaT` variables are being used without being defined or imported. They should be defined within the function or imported from the appropriate module.
3. There is a missing import for the necessary modules like `np`, `isna`, and `to_datetime`.

To fix the function, the following code could be used:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, to_datetime

class Parser():
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
    
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
    
        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)  # Define self.min_stamp
                | (new_data == iNaT)  # Define iNaT
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False
    
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
