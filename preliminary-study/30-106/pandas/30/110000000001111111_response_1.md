The bug is likely occurring in the `_try_convert_to_date` function of a class, which is used when trying to convert data into a date column. The function first checks if the given data is empty, and if it's not, it tries to coerce the data into an integer format if it is of type "object". It then checks if the data is in range for timestamps and tries to convert it to a date using the `to_datetime` function.

The bug seems to be causing unexpected behavior when converting bool values into dates. This is likely due to the incorrect attempt at coercion when the data type is "object".

To fix this bug, we should handle bool values as a special case, and avoid coercing them into integers. We should also handle the conversion to date differently for boolean data.

Here's the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import to_datetime, isna, iNaT

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        if new_data.dtype == "bool":
            new_data = new_data.astype('int64')
        else:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise")
                return new_data, True
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    return new_data, False
```
