The bug in the code is caused by the incorrect handling of boolean data when trying to convert it into a date column. The function `_try_convert_to_date` first checks if the data is of type "object" and tries to convert it to "int64". However, this logic is incorrect as boolean data should not be converted to "int64". As a result, the function erroneously tries to parse boolean data as dates, which leads to the unexpected behavior and errors.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to specifically handle boolean data and return a Series of boolean values instead of attempting to convert it into date formats.

The corrected code for the function `_try_convert_to_date` is as follows:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    elif new_data.dtype == "bool":
        return new_data, False
    
    return new_data, True
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle boolean data and return a Series of boolean values without trying to convert it into date formats, fixing the bug described in the GitHub issue.
