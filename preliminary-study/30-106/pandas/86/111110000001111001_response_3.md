Potential error location: 
The potential error is in the `else` block of the `if values is None` condition. It appears that the code inside the `else` block is assuming `values` is not None, but this assumption seems to be problematic.

Reasons behind the bug:
The bug seems to occur because the code does not handle the case where `values` is None properly. It doesn't account for the possibility that `index` or `columns` could also be None.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if `index` or `columns` is None, and handle these cases appropriately.
2. Add conditions to check if any of the input parameters are None and handle these cases accordingly.

Corrected code:

```python
from pandas import DataFrame, MultiIndex

# this is the corrected function
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot"], indents=1)
def pivot(data: "DataFrame", index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> "DataFrame":
    if values is None:
        if index is None and columns is None:
            raise ValueError("Both index and columns cannot be None when values is None")
        
        indexed = data.pivot(index=index, columns=columns, values=values)   
    else:
        if index is None:
            index = data.index
        else:
            index = data[index]

        index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])

        if is_list_like(values) and not isinstance(values, tuple):
            # Exclude tuple because it is seen as a single column name
            indexed = data._constructor(
                data[values].values, index=index, columns=values
            )
        else:
            indexed = data._constructor_sliced(data[values].values, index=index)

    return indexed.unstack(columns)
```
In the corrected code, I used the `pivot` function provided by pandas to handle the case when `values` is None and added a check for both `index` and `columns` to ensure they are not None when `values` is None.
