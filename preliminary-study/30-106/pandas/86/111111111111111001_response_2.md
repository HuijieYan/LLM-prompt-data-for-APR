1. The test case is trying to pivot the DataFrame 'df' using the 'col1' column as the index and the 'col3' column as the values. However, it is not providing the 'columns' argument, which should be mandatory according to the error message.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statements related to the 'index' and 'columns' variables. These conditional statements are not handling the case where 'columns' is provided but 'index' is missing.

3. The bug occurred because the function did not handle the scenario where the 'columns' argument is not provided but the 'index' argument is.

4. To fix the bug, we can modify the code to handle the scenario where the 'columns' argument is missing but the 'index' argument is provided. Additionally, we should update the conditional statements to ensure that both 'index' and 'columns' are properly handled.

5. Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def pivot(data, index=None, columns=None, values=None):
    if columns is None:
        raise TypeError("pivot() missing 1 required argument: 'columns'")
    
    if values is None:
        cols = [columns] if index is None else [index, columns]
        append = index is None
        indexed = data.set_index(cols, append=append)
    else:
        if index is None:
            index = data.index
        else:
            index = data[index]
        index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])
        
        if is_list_like(values) and not isinstance(values, tuple):
            # Exclude tuple because it is seen as a single column name
            indexed = data._constructor(
                data[values].values, index=index, columns=values
            )
        else:
            indexed = data._constructor_sliced(data[values].values, index=index)
    return indexed.unstack(columns)
```

In the corrected code, we added a check for the 'columns' argument and raised an error if it was missing. Additionally, we revised the conditional statements to ensure that both 'index' and 'columns' are properly handled.
