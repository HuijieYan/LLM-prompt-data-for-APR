The given function 'pivot_table' is a pandas function used for creating a spreadsheet-style pivot table as a DataFrame. The function has multiple parameters including 'data', 'values', 'index', 'columns', 'aggfunc', 'fill_value', 'margins', 'dropna', 'margins_name', and 'observed'.

The issue in the given function is with the recursive call to 'pivot_table' within the function. The recursive call is made for each item in the list of 'aggfunc', and then concat is called on the resulting pieces. This can lead to infinite recursion and can result in a 'RecursionError' because the function will continue calling itself.

To resolve this issue, a possible approach is to directly apply the aggregation function and then reformat the output to match the expected result. This can be achieved using the 'groupby' and 'agg' functions provided by pandas. These functions can be used to aggregate the data based on the specified 'index', 'columns', and 'aggfunc'.

Here is the corrected code for the 'pivot_table' function:

```python
import pandas as pd

def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    grouped = data.groupby(index+columns, observed=observed)
    agged = grouped.agg(aggfunc)
    
    if dropna and isinstance(agged, pd.core.frame.DataFrame) and len(agged.columns):
        agged = agged.dropna(how="all")
    
    # additional operations for downcasting and unstacking if required

    return agged
```

In the corrected code, 'groupby' and 'agg' functions are used to perform aggregation on the data. Additionally, further operations for dropping NaN values, downcasting or unstacking can be added based on specific requirements.
