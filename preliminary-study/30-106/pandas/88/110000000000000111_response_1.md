Based on the test case provided, the error occurs when using the pivot_table function with multi-index columns. The error message indicates that the function is trying to access the attribute 'columns' on a Series object, which does not have that attribute.

The error is likely occurring when the function is attempting to handle multi-index columns, as indicated by the error message referring to 'table.columns'. The bug is likely related to the logic for handling multi-index columns, which is not correctly implemented.

To fix the bug, the code for handling multi-index columns needs to be reviewed and corrected. Specifically, the code that checks for multi-index columns and attempts to access the 'columns' attribute should be carefully reviewed to ensure that it is correctly handling this scenario.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # rest of the function remains unchanged

    if table.empty:
        return table

    if table.columns.nlevels > 1:
        table = table.stack(dropna=dropna)

    if not dropna:
        table = table.unstack()

    if fill_value is not None:
        table = table.fillna(fill_value)

    if margins:
        table = add_margins(
            table,
            data,
            values,
            rows=index,
            cols=columns,
            aggfunc=aggfunc,
            observed=dropna,
            margins_name=margins_name,
            fill_value=fill_value,
        )

    # discard the top level
    if (
        values_passed
        and not values_multi
        and not table.empty
        and (table.columns.nlevels > 1)
    ):
        table = table[values[0]]

    if len(index) == 0 and len(columns) > 0:
        table = table.T

    if isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame) and dropna:
        table = table.dropna(how="all", axis=1)

    return table
```

In the corrected code, the handling of multi-index columns has been adjusted to correctly handle the stacking and unstacking of the table based on the number of column levels. Additionally, the code for filling NaN values and adding margins has been adjusted to ensure consistency and correctness.
