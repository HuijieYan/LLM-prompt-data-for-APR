The buggy function, `pivot_table`, appears to be a modified version of the `pivot_table` function from the Pandas library. The error message from the test function indicates that there is an AttributeError in the function when trying to access the 'columns' attribute of a DataFrame.

Upon inspection of the buggy function's code, it seems that the issue arises from the recursive call to `pivot_table` within the function. This recursive call is intended to handle the scenario when `aggfunc` is a list of aggregation functions. However, it seems that in doing so, the correct behavior of the original `pivot_table` function from Pandas is being bypassed, leading to incorrect results and the AttributeError.

The reason for the bug is that the original behavior of the `pivot_table` function is being bypassed due to the recursive call, resulting in unexpected behavior and errors.

To fix the bug, it would be best to revise the approach to handling multiple aggregation functions within the `pivot_table` function. Instead of using a recursive call within the function, the multiple aggregation functions can be handled using the core aggregation and transformation methods provided by Pandas, such as `groupby` and `agg`.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def pivot_table(data, values=None, index=None, columns=None, aggfunc='mean', fill_value=None, margins=False, dropna=True, margins_name='All', observed=False) -> 'DataFrame':
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            table = data.pivot_table(values=values, index=index, columns=columns, fill_value=fill_value, aggfunc=func, margins=margins, dropna=dropna, margins_name=margins_name, observed=observed)
            pieces.append(table)

        result = pd.concat(pieces, keys=aggfunc, axis=1)
        return result
    
    keys = index + columns

    # rest of the original code
    # ...
```

In the corrected code, the multiple aggregation functions are handled by iterating through each function, creating the pivot table for each function, and then concatenating the results into a single DataFrame. This approach avoids the recursive call issue and leverages the core functionalities of Pandas for handling aggregation.

By implementing this correction, the function should behave as expected and eliminate the AttributeError that was occurring due to the bypassing of the original function behavior.
