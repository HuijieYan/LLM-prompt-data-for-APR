The error message shows an AttributeError when the `pivot_table` function is called within the test function. The error occurs when trying to access the 'columns' attribute of a Series object.

The potential error is likely due to the code trying to treat a Series object as a DataFrame. This could be happening within the `pivot_table` function.

Upon analyzing the function, it appears that the bug is caused by recursive calls to the `pivot_table` function from within the function itself, without checking for a base case to terminate the recursion.

To fix the issue, the recursive call to `pivot_table` within the `aggfunc` list iteration should be replaced with a call to the `groupby` function. Additionally, a base case for the recursion should also be added to terminate the recursive calls.

Below is the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function with the fix described:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            grouped = data.groupby(index + columns, observed=observed)
            table = grouped.agg(func)
            pieces.append(table)
            keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        return concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)

    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
    # ...

    return table
```
In the corrected code, the recursive call to `pivot_table` within the `aggfunc` list iteration has been removed and replaced with calls to the `groupby` and `agg` functions. This should ensure that the function does not get stuck in recursive calls and the calculations are performed correctly.
