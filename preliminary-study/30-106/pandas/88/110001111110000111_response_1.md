The problem is occurring in the `pivot_table` function. The error is due to the fact that when the function checks if `table.columns.nlevels > 1`, it is assuming `table` is a DataFrame, but in some cases, it is a Series. This assumption leads to the AttributeError because a Series does not have a `columns` attribute.

To fix this bug, the `pivot_table` function needs to be updated to handle both DataFrame and Series objects. This can be achieved by checking the type of `table` and applying different logic for DataFrames and Series.

Here's the corrected `pivot_table` function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    # ... (omitted code) ...
    # existing code remains the same until the line where the error occurs

    if isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame):
        if table.columns.nlevels > 1:
            table = table[values[0]]
    elif isinstance(table, ABCSeries):
        table = table.to_frame()

    if len(index) == 0 and len(columns) > 0:
        table = table.T

    # ... (omitted code) ...

    return table
```

In this corrected code, after the `if table.columns.nlevels > 1` block, an `elif` statement is added to handle Series objects. If `table` is a Series, it is converted to a DataFrame using the `to_frame` method. This ensures that the subsequent operations will work consistently whether `table` is a DataFrame or a Series.
