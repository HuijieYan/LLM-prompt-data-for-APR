The error is occurring in the `pivot_table` function when trying to access the `columns` attribute of the `table` variable, which seems to be a `Series` object instead of a `DataFrame` as expected.

The potential error location is identified in the portion of the code where it filters the result of the pivot table based on the type of result and the number of levels in the index and columns.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code is assuming the result of the pivot table operation will always be a `DataFrame`. However, in some cases, it may end up being a `Series` object, which does not have a `columns` attribute.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to handle the case when the result is a `Series` instead of a `DataFrame`. This might involve a conditional to check the type of the result and handle it accordingly.

Here is the corrected code for the `pivot_table` function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # ... (previous code remains unchanged)

    # The following code replaces the error-prone section
    if isinstance(table, Series):
        table = table.to_frame()

    if values_passed and not values_multi and not table.empty and (table.columns.nlevels > 1):
        table = table[values[0]]

    if len(index) == 0 and len(columns) > 0:
        table = table.T

    if isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame) and dropna:
        table = table.dropna(how="all", axis=1)

    return table
```

In the corrected code, we are checking if the result `table` is a `Series`, and if so, we convert it to a `DataFrame` using `to_frame()` method. Then, we continue with the remaining operations as before. This should handle the bug and prevent the AttributeError from occurring.
