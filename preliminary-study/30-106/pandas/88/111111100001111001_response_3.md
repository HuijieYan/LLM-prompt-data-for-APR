The problematic function is a pivot_table function that is intended to pivot a DataFrame based on the provided parameters. It seems to have multiple issues. The potential error locations are around the aggregation of the grouped data and the handling of the index and columns.

The issues arise from mishandling the inputs and aggregation logic. The function seems to be recursively calling itself when aggfunc is a list, which can lead to unintended behavior. Moreover, the logic for handling keys, values, and grouping might result in unexpected errors.

To fix the issues, the recursive call when aggfunc is a list should be replaced with a loop that iterates over the elements of the list and aggregates the data accordingly. Additionally, the handling of keys and values needs to be revised to ensure that the pivot table is constructed correctly.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    keys = index + columns

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            grouped = data.groupby(keys, observed=observed)
            agged = grouped.agg(func)
            pieces.append(agged)

        table = pd.concat(pieces, axis=1)
    else:
        grouped = data.groupby(keys, observed=observed)
        table = grouped.agg(aggfunc)

    if fill_value is not None:
        table = table.fillna(fill_value)

    if margins:
        table = _add_margins(
            table,
            data,
            values,
            rows=index,
            cols=columns,
            aggfunc=aggfunc,
            observed=observed,
            margins_name=margins_name,
            fill_value=fill_value,
        )

    return table
```
This corrected code addresses the issues by aggregating the data using a loop when aggfunc is a list and correctly handling the fill_value and margins based on the provided parameters.
