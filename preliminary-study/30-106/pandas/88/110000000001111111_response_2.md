The issue is related to the `table.columns.nlevels` expression in the `pivot_table` function. The error occurs because the `table` object is being treated as a Series object, which does not have a `columns` attribute.

The bug occurs because the code is assuming that `table` will always be a DataFrame and trying to access the `columns` attribute on it. However, in some cases, `table` is a Series, which does not have a `columns` attribute, leading to the AttributeError.

To fix this bug, we can modify the code to check the type of `table` before trying to access its `columns` attribute. If `table` is a DataFrame, then we can proceed with the `table.columns.nlevels` check. If it is a Series, we can handle it differently.

Here is the corrected `pivot_table` function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # ... (existing code)

    if not isinstance(table, pd.Series):
        if values_passed and not values_multi and not table.empty and table.columns.nlevels > 1:
            table = table[values[0]]

    # ... (remaining code)
    return table
```
