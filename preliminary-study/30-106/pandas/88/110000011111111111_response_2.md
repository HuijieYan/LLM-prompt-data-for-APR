The error is occurring in the `pivot_table` function of the pandas library while using multi-index columns.

The error message `AttributeError: 'Series' object has no attribute 'columns'` suggests that the code is trying to access the `columns` attribute on a Series object, which is not possible because a Series does not have a `columns` attribute.

The root cause of the issue is that when the `pivot_table` function is used with multi-index columns, it is returning a Series instead of a DataFrame, and in the subsequent code, it is trying to access the `columns` attribute on this Series object.

To fix this issue, the `pivot_table` function should always return a DataFrame, even when using multi-index columns.

Here's the corrected `pivot_table` function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # existing implementation...

    # existing code for handling the pivot table...

    # instead of returning Series, convert it to DataFrame
    if table.index.nlevels > 1:
        table = table.to_frame()

    # existing code...

    return table
```

In the corrected function, a check has been added to convert the result to a DataFrame if the index has multiple levels. This ensures that the result is always a DataFrame, allowing the subsequent code to access the `columns` attribute without encountering an AttributeError.

This fix will ensure that the `pivot_table` function always returns a DataFrame, resolving the issue of accessing the `columns` attribute on a Series.
