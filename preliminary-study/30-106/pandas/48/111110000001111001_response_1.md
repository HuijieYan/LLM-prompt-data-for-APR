The problematic function `_cython_agg_blocks` seems to be related to the aggregation of data within a DataFrameGroupBy object. This method is responsible for performing the aggregation operation on the data specified by the function parameters.

The bug seems to be related to the aggregation logic within the function, which is causing incorrect aggregation results.

The potential issue might be related to the incorrect aggregation of data due to some faulty logic within the try-except block that handles the aggregation. It seems that the exception handling and the subsequent aggregation logic might not be functioning as expected, leading to incorrect results.

One possible approach to fixing the bug could be to review the aggregation logic and the exception handling mechanism to ensure that the correct aggregation method is being applied in all cases. Additionally, verifying the input data and the expected output could help identify the discrepancies in the aggregation process.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    # Perform aggregation based on the specified 'how' parameter
    if how == 'mean':
        agg_results = data.apply(lambda x: x.mean(), axis=1)
    elif how == 'median':
        agg_results = data.apply(lambda x: x.median(), axis=1)
    elif how == 'var':
        agg_results = data.apply(lambda x: x.var(), axis=1)
    else:
        # Handle unsupported aggregation methods
        raise ValueError("Unsupported aggregation method")

    # Process the aggregation results and prepare the output
    agg_blocks = [Block(data=agg_results)]
    agg_items = agg_results.columns

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected code:
- We specifically define the aggregation methods for 'mean', 'median', and 'var'.
- We apply the corresponding method to the data and store the aggregation results.
- We handle unsupported aggregation methods with a `ValueError`.
- We prepare the output based on the aggregation results.

This approach ensures that the aggregation process is well-defined and covers different aggregation methods while handling unsupported methods gracefully.
