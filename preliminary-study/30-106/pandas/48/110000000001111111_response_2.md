The issue is related to calling the `mean` function on a DataFrameGroupBy object with Int64 dtype, resulting in a TypeError. The reported error occurs with other functions such as `median` and `std` as well. The issue is not observed when calling `min`, `max`, or `first`, indicating that the problem is specific to certain aggregation functions.

The bug is likely to be located within the `_cython_agg_blocks` method of the pandas library. The error occurs when attempting to aggregate data with the `mean` function, and potentially other similar aggregation functions.

The bug arises due to the new nullable integer data type (Int64) introduced in pandas. It may not be handled properly in the aggregation methods, leading to a TypeError when certain functions are called on the grouped data.

To fix the bug, it would be necessary to update the implementation of the `_cython_agg_blocks` method to handle the nullable integer data type (Int64) correctly when performing aggregation operations. Specifically, handling the aggregation of nullable integer data type using functions like `mean`, `median`, and `std` should be addressed.

Below is the corrected implementation of the `_cython_agg_blocks` method:

```python
# Corrected function
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.convert_to_common_type()
      
    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
  
  # Rest of the code remains the same as the original implementation
  # ...
  # ...
  # ...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected implementation, the `convert_to_common_type` method is used to handle the nullable integer (Int64) data type appropriately before performing aggregation operations. This should address the TypeError issue when calling aggregation functions on nullable integer data types in a DataFrameGroupBy object.
