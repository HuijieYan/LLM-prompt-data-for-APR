The error occurs due to the incorrect casting of float values to integer values, leading to the TypeError. This issue originates from the function `_cython_agg_blocks`.

The bug is likely due to the incorrect handling of nullable integer values when performing aggregation operations. When working with nullable integer data, certain aggregation functions such as mean, median, and var might produce floating-point results. However, the function `_cython_agg_blocks` attempts to cast these floating-point results back to integers, resulting in a TypeError.

To fix this bug, the function `_cython_agg_blocks` should be modified to handle the nullable integer values properly and avoid casting float values to integers.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    ...
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Existing code
        # ...
        if result is not no_result:
            # New code
            original_dtype = block.dtype
            if original_dtype.kind == 'i' and original_dtype.name.startswith('Int'):
                # Safely cast the values to the original dtype if they are equivalent
                if isinstance(result, pd.DataFrame):
                    result = result.astype(original_dtype, errors='ignore')
                else:
                    try:
                        result = pd.arrays.IntegerArray(result, dtype=original_dtype)
                    except (TypeError, ValueError):
                        pass
        # Existing code
        # ...
    ...
    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected code, we check if the original data type of the block is a nullable integer type. If it is, we safely cast the resulting values back to the original dtype without causing a TypeError. This update ensures that nullable integer values are handled properly during aggregation operations.
