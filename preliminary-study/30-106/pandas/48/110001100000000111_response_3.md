The issue seems to be related to calling the `mean` function after grouping on a DataFrame with `Int64` dtype, which results in a TypeError.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the `_cython_agg_blocks` method, which is called when aggregating grouped data and seems to be related to the error message.

The bug occurs due to type handling issues when trying to aggregate `Int64` dtype columns using the `mean` function after grouping. This might be due to incorrect type inference or handling of nullable integer data types (`Int64`). 

To fix the bug, the `_cython_agg_blocks` method should be modified to handle nullable integer data types (`Int64`) correctly when aggregating using the mean function. This might involve handling possible data type conversions or casting during the aggregation process.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... existing code ...

    from pandas.core.groupby.groupby import _get_data_to_aggregate as get_data_to_aggregate
    from pandas.core.arrays.integer import _return_true_for_all_not_none
    from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_integer_dtype

    data: BlockManager = get_data_to_aggregate(self)
    
    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    if _return_true_for_all_not_none([is_integer_dtype(dtype) for dtype in data.dtypes]):
        # Convert nullable integers to regular integers for aggregation
        data = data.astype('int')

    # ... existing code ...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected code, we explicitly handle the conversion of nullable integers (`Int64` dtype) to regular integers for aggregation if all the columns in the data are nullable integers. This should resolve the issue when calling the mean function after grouping on a DataFrame with `Int64` dtype columns.
