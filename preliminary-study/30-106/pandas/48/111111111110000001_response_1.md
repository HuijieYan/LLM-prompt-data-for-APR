The error occurs when the `safe_cast` function tries to convert the floating-point values to integers. This is because the original data contains float values which are being cast to integer using the `astype` method. This operation is not valid because the "safe" casting rules do not allow conversion from float to integer. This causes a `TypeError` to be raised.

To fix this bug, the code should handle the conversion of float to integer values appropriately. This can be achieved by checking the type of the input values and if they are of float type, converting them to the appropriate integer type.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
# this is the correct code after fixing the bug
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # Rest of the code remains the same

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        # Other parts of the code

        if result is not no_result:
            if result.dtype == float:
                # Convert the float type result to integer type appropriately
                if result.all() and result.ndim == 1:
                    # Convert a 1D array with all values as integers to the integer type
                    result = result.astype('int64')
                else:
                    # If the result is not all integers and has multiple dimensions, cast to object type array
                    result = result.astype('object')

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # Rest of the code remains the same
    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This code fixes the bug by checking if the result is of float type and casting it to integer type appropriately. If the result is not entirely composed of integers and has multiple dimensions, it is cast to the object type array. These operations ensure that the conversion from float to integer is handled correctly, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring.
