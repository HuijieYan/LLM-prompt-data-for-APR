The error message indicates that there is an issue with casting from a float64 dtype to an int64 dtype. This error occurs when the function tries to cast float64 dtype data to int64 dtype using the `safe_cast` function, but the cast fails because the values are not equivalent.

The issue seems to be related to the creation of the `Int64` DataFrame and the subsequent aggregation operations that result in non-equivalent float and integer values. The `safe_cast` function is not able to handle the non-equivalent data types.

To fix this issue, it might be necessary to handle the aggregation of non-equivalent float and integer values separately, ensuring that the casting operation can handle this difference.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    return agg_blocks, data.items
```

This revised function simplifies the aggregation process and avoids the type casting issues. It directly applies the aggregation function to the blocks and creates new aggregated blocks without explicitly handling the casting operation.
