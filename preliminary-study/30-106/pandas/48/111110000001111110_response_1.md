# Corrected function

Based on the input and the bug description, it appears that the issue is related to the `BlockManager.get_numeric_data` method. In the original `_cython_agg_blocks` function, the following code tries to get the numeric data:
```python
data = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
if numeric_only:
    data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
```

It seems that the method `get_numeric_data` is not handling the nullable integer dtype properly, resulting in a TypeError when the `mean` function is called on the grouped data.

The corrected `_cython_agg_blocks` function should handle the nullable integer dtype properly before calling the `mean` function on the grouped data. The fix may involve checking the dtype of the data and converting it to a suitable format for the calculation.

Here is a modified version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function with the potential fix:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    # Handle nullable integer dtype conversion
    if numeric_only:
        if isinstance(data._data.get_dtype_of_items(), pd.Int64Dtype):
            data = data._data.apply(lambda x: x.astype(float) if pd.api.types.is_nullable(x) else x, axis=0)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    # Rest of the function logic remains the same...

```

This fix checks the dtype of the data and converts it to a suitable format (in this case, float) before proceeding with the aggregation calculation.

Remember to thoroughly test this fix to ensure that it addresses the issue described in the bug report.
