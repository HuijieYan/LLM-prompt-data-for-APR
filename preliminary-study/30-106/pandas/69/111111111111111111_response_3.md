Potential Error Location:
The issue is likely occurring within the `_convert_key` method of the `_AtIndexer` class. This method is responsible for ensuring that the keys match the type of the index.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The bug is likely occurring due to inconsistency in handling integer and non-integer indexes. The `_convert_key` method is not properly handling the integer and non-integer index cases, leading to the ValueError being raised.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `_convert_key` method to appropriately handle integer and non-integer indexes. Specifically, the checks for whether the index is integer or holds integer need to be revised to handle the different data types properly.

Corrected Code for the Problematic Function:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At-based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At-based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
In the corrected code, we first check if the index is of type pd.Int64Index, and then validate the key accordingly. If the index is non-integer, we ensure that the key is also non-integer. Similarly, if the index is integer, the key must be of integer type. This approach ensures that the keys match the type of the index.
