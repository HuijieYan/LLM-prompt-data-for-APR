The error occurs when the `ser.at[4]` method is called, which should cast the integer index to a float. However, the error message indicates that the `_convert_key` function in `IndexingMixin` is not handling this conversion correctly.

The bug is likely occurring because the `_convert_key` function is not properly handling the case where the index is a float and the key being used for the lookup is an integer.

To fix the bug, we can update the `_convert_key` function in the `IndexingMixin` class to handle the case where the index is a float and the key being used for the lookup is an integer. This can be done by adding a check to convert the integer key to a float before comparing it with the index.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    index_type = type(self.obj.index)
    if issubclass(index_type, pd.Float64Index) and not isinstance(key, float):
        key = float(key)

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
