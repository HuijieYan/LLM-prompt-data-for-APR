The bug occurs in the `_convert_key` method of the `_AtIndexer` class. The method is responsible for converting keys and validating them based on the index type. The error message suggests that the method raises a ValueError when encountering non-integer indexers.

The issue is related to the validation logic where it checks for `is_integer()` for the axis and `is_integer()` for the indexer key and `holds_integer()` for the axis. The method incorrectly raises a ValueError when the indexer key is not an integer for non-integer axes.

To fix the bug, the validation in the `if-else` block needs to be updated, and the conditional checks should be refined to handle non-integer indexers properly based on the axis type.

Here's the corrected method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if ax.is_floating() and not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
