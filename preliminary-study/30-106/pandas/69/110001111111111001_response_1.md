The error occurs because the `_convert_key` function is trying to compare the type of the index with the type of the key but is not handling floating-point keys correctly when it encounters a floating-point index. The issue arises from the comparison between the key and the index type without considering the floating-point nature of the index.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function to handle floating-point keys appropriately when they are used with a floating-point index. This can be achieved by introducing a condition to check if the index type is floating-point and then accordingly handle the key type.

Here's the corrected `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, Float64Index):  # Checking index type for floating-point
            i = float(i)  # Converting the key to float if the index is floating-point
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

By introducing the condition that checks if the index type is floating-point and converting the key to float in that case, we ensure that the comparison is done correctly, and the bug is fixed.
