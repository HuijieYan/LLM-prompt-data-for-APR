The potential error location within the problematic function is the nested if-else conditions with the comparison functions. The issue arises because the `is_integer()` and `holds_integer()` functions are not defined, leading to errors in the comparison logic.

The bug occurs because the code is trying to compare the key values to specific criteria based on the type of index, but the comparison functions are not defined, leading to errors during runtime.

To fix the bug, the comparison functions `is_integer()` and `holds_integer()` need to be defined or replaced with appropriate logic to compare the key values based on the type of index.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a Float64 index can only have float indexers"
                )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex):
            if not isinstance(i, datetime):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a Datetime index can only have datetime indexers"
                )
        # Add more specific cases for other types of indices as needed
        else:
            # default case
            return key
    return key
```

In the corrected code, I added specific checks based on the type of index (e.g., Float64Index, DatetimeIndex), and then raised a ValueError if the key does not match the expected type. This approach makes the function more robust and handles different types of indices appropriately.
