The bug is likely located in the `_convert_key` method of the `pandas.core.indexing` module. The current implementation of `_convert_key` does not handle cases where the index is of type `float64`. This is causing the ValueError to be raised when attempting to index or get values from the Series.

The buggy implementation of `_convert_key` does not properly handle cases where the index is of type `float64`, leading to the ValueError being raised when using `ser.at`.

To fix this bug, the `_convert_key` method needs to be modified to handle cases where the index is of type `float64`. Additionally, the method should handle integer and non-integer indexers appropriately for the given index type.

Below is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a float64 index can only have float indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    f"At based indexing on an {type(ax).__name__} index can only have {type(ax).__name__} indexers"
                )
    return key
```

By updating the implementation as shown above, we ensure that the `_convert_key` method properly handles cases where the index is of type `float64`, and checks whether the indexer is of the appropriate type based on the index type.

This corrected implementation should address the bug and allow the test case to run without errors when using `ser.at` with float indexers.
