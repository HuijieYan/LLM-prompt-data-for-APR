The error occurs in the `_convert_key` method in the `pandas/core/indexing.py` file. The error message indicates that "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers." This suggests that there is an issue with the handling of non-integer indexers.

The potential error location within the `_convert_key` method is the logic that checks whether the indexer is an integer or non-integer.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the current logic does not correctly handle the cases where the indexer is non-integer.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to revise the logic for handling non-integer indexers by introducing a conditional check specifically for non-integer indexers.

Below is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)
    
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_integer(i) and not (ax.holds_integer() or ax.is_datetime() or ax.is_timedelta()):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                    "can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

In the corrected code, I added an additional condition to check for non-integer indexers and added support for datetime and timedelta indexers to be considered as non-integer indexers.
