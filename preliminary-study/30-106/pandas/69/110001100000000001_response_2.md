Potential Error Location: The potential error is likely in the 'for' loop that iterates through the axes and keys. 

Reason for the Bug: The bug occurs because the function is trying to check the type of the index and key using the methods 'is_integer()' and 'holds_integer()', which are not correct methods.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug: Use the 'is_integer' and 'is_integer_dtype' methods for checking integer values, and 'is_numeric' method to check non-integer values for the index and key types.

Corrected Code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_numeric():
            if not pd.api.types.is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a numeric index "
                    "can only have numeric indexers"
                )
        else:
            if pd.api.types.is_numeric_dtype(i) and not ax.is_numeric():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-numeric "
                    "index can only have non-numeric "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
In the corrected code, I have used the correct methods to check for numeric (integer and non-integer) values for both the index and key types.
