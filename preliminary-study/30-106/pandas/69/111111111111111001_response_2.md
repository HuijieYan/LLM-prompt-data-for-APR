The error occurs in the `_convert_key` function in the `pandas.core.indexing` module, where it checks the types of values in the key parameter against the index.

The error message indicates that the code is erroneously trying to convert an integer-based indexing operation (`at[4]`) on a non-integer index. This is due to the logic in the `_convert_key` function where it checks for integer-based indexing on non-integer indexes. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function to handle the conversion and type checking correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, (pd.Int64Index, pd.Float64Index)) and not isinstance(i, (int, float)):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not isinstance(ax, (pd.Int64Index, pd.Float64Index)) and not isinstance(i, (int, float)):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```

In the corrected code, we use `isinstance` to check whether the index and the key values are of integer type (`int` or `float`). We've also separated the logic for handling integer and non-integer indexes.

This should resolve the issues with the `_convert_key` function and ensure that the index and key values are checked and handled correctly.
