Potential error location: The problematic part of the code is the conditional statements inside the for loop, where it checks if the index is an integer and then checks if the key value is an integer. 

Reason for the bug: The bug occurs because the comparison of the key values with the index type is not handled correctly. The function is checking if the index is an integer, but it should check if the index type is float.

Approach to fix the bug: Modify the conditional statements to check if the index type is float and not an integer.

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_floating():
            if not isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a floating index "
                    "can only have floating indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not isinstance(i, (int, np.int_)) and ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```
