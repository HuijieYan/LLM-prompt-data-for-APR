The error message indicates that there is an issue with the `_convert_key` function in the `pandas.core.indexing` module. The error occurs when it is trying to handle non-integer indices for "At" based indexing.

The bug occurs because the `_convert_key` function should handle non-integer indices properly for "At" based indexing, but it is currently raising a ValueError instead of handling the non-integer index.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to modify the `_convert_key` function to correctly handle non-integer indices for "At" based indexing, rather than raising a ValueError.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            # Handle non-integer indices for "At" based indexing
            if not (is_integer(i) or pd.api.types.is_float(i)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

In the corrected code, a condition is added to handle non-integer indices for "At" based indexing. If the index is not an integer or float, it will raise a ValueError.
