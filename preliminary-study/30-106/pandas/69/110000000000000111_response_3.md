Potential error location: The potential error location within the problematic function is the check for whether the index or key is an integer. The logic for checking if the index is an integer or not is incorrect.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the function is trying to check if the index is an integer using the method `is_integer()`, which is not a valid method for checking if an object is an integer.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Use the `isinstance()` method to check if the index is an integer or not. Additionally, it would be helpful to add comments to explain the purpose of the code and improve readability.

Corrected code:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(i, int) and ax.is_integer():
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                "index can only have non-integer "
                "indexers"
            )
    return key
```
