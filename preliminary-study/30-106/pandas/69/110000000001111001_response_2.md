Potential error location: The potential error is located in the 'for' loop inside the _convert_key function. Specifically, the 'is_integer' and 'holds_integer' methods being called on the 'ax' parameter.

Reason for the bug: The bug occurs because the 'ax' parameter is of type Float64Index, and it does not have the methods 'is_integer' and 'holds_integer'. This causes the AttributeError.

Approach for fixing the bug: We should check the type of 'ax' and handle the cases accordingly to avoid AttributeError. Additionally, we should check the type of 'i' and handle it appropriately based on the type.

Corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a float index can only have float indexers"
                )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.TimedeltaIndex):
            if not isinstance(i, pd.Timedelta):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a timedelta index can only have timedelta indexers"
                )
    return key
```
