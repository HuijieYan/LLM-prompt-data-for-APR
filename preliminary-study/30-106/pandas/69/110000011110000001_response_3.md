The error occurs when the `.at` method is used with an integer value in the test case. The error message indicates that "_convert_key()" method is trying to handle the key, but it is unable to handle non-integer indices. The reason behind the bug is that the "_convert_key()" method is not correctly handling non-integer indices when `is_setter` is False. To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the "_convert_key()" method to handle non-integer indices properly based on the value of `ax.holds_integer()`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                  )
    return key
```
