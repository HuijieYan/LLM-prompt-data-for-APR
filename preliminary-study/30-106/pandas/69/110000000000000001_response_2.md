Potential error location: The function is checking whether the index is integer or not, but the function 'is_integer()' is not defined.

Reason for the bug: The function is trying to use a method 'is_integer()' without it being defined. This is likely a typo or a missing library import.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Define the 'is_integer()' method or import the appropriate library where this method is defined.

Corrected code:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, int):
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not isinstance(ax, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
