The buggy function `_convert_key` is throwing a `ValueError` when the input key does not match the index type. The error occurs because the function is not handling the case where an integer key is provided for a non-integer index.

To fix this bug:
- We need to check the data types of the keys and indices and handle the cases where they do not match.
- Specifically, when checking if the index is an integer, we need to consider the case where the index is not integer, and when checking if the key is an integer, we need to consider the case where the key is not an integer.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int) and not np.issubdtype(type(i), np.integer):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if (isinstance(i, int) or np.issubdtype(type(i), np.integer)) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code will handle the cases where the key and index types do not match and prevent the `ValueError` from being raised. Testing this corrected function with the provided test cases should result in successful completion without any errors.
