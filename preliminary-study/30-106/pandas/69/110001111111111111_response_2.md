### Issue Analysis

The error message indicates that there is a problem with the `self._convert_key(key)` call within the `__getitem__` method of the `_AtIndexer` class in the file `pandas/core/indexing.py`. It suggests that the issue is related to handling non-integer indexes in the `ps.Series` lookups.

### Bug Identification

The issue arises because the function `_convert_key` is incorrectly handling non-integer indexes, and this is causing a `ValueError` to be raised when trying to use `at` based indexing.

### Reasons Behind the Bug

The buggy code is not properly handling the case when the index is non-integer, leading to the `ValueError` during indexing operations.

### Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug

1. Update the `_convert_key` function to handle non-integer indexes properly.
2. Check the type of the index and the indexer and perform the required checks before raising a `ValueError`.

### Corrected Code

Based on the above analysis, here's the corrected `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index (so we don't fallback).
    """
    # Allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected version of the function introduces explicit type checks for the index and the indexer, ensuring that the correct type of indexers is used for integer and non-integer indexes.

By making these changes, the function should now handle both integer and non-integer indexes correctly and avoid raising `ValueError` during indexing operations.
