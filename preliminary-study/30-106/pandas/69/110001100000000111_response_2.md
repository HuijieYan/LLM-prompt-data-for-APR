The issue seems to be related to indexing and the types of keys used for indexing in the pandas library. The error message suggests that there are corner cases in DTI.get_value and Float64Index.get_value, which indicates that the bug might be related to how indexing is handled for floating-point indexes.

Looking at the code, the potential error location seems to be in the loop that iterates through the axes and the keys. It's likely that the bug occurs when checking the type of the key against the type of the index.

The bug occurs because the code is trying to determine the type of the key and the type of the index in a way that is not consistent with the expected behavior. This inconsistency can cause issues when trying to handle integer and non-integer indexes.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the code checks the type of the key and the type of the index. We also need to handle the case of Float64Index more carefully, as the bug seems to be related to this specific index type.

Here's the corrected code for the _convert_key function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index.
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a Float64Index can only have float indexers"
                )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.Index):
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    f"At based indexing on an {ax.__class__.__name__} can only have integer indexers" if ax.is_integer() else f"At based indexing on an {ax.__class__.__name__} can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            raise ValueError("Unsupported index type")

    return key
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the index type is a Float64Index and ensure that the key is of type float. Then, for other index types, we check if the key is of type integer or non-integer based on the type of the index. Lastly, we handle the case for unsupported index types by raising a ValueError.
