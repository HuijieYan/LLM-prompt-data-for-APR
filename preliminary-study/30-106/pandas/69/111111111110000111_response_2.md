The error message indicates that the bug occurs in the `_convert_key` method of the `_AtIndexer` class within the `pandas.core.indexing` module. The bug appears to be related to the `if` condition inside the `for` loop of the `_convert_key` method. It is likely that this condition is not handling the key conversion properly, leading to a `ValueError` being raised.

The reason for this bug could be that the `if` condition inside the `for` loop is not checking the types of `i` and `ax` correctly, leading to the `ValueError` being raised erroneously.

To fix the bug, the conditional checks need to be modified to handle the conversion of the key properly based on the types of `i` and `ax`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if pd.api.types.is_integer(i) and not pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype(ax):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code ensures that the conditional checks based on the types of `i` and `ax` are performed using `pd.api.types` methods to accurately determine whether the key conversion is handled correctly.
