Potential error location: The error seems to occur in the loop where it checks if the index is an integer.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug occurs because the function is incorrectly checking if the index is an integer, leading to the ValueError being raised incorrectly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Instead of checking if the index is an integer, check if the index type matches the type of the axis.
2. Use the isinstance() function to check the type of the index.

Corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if not isinstance(i, type(ax)):
            raise ValueError("Keys must be the same type as the index.")

    return key
```
