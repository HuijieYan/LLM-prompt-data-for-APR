Potential Error Location: 
The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of the 'is_integer()' and 'holds_integer()' functions. It seems like these functions are being used incorrectly or they may be custom functions defined elsewhere.

Reasons for the Bug:
The error occurs because the 'is_integer()' and 'holds_integer()' functions are not standard Python functions, and it's not clear what they are supposed to do. This leads to an error when the code is run.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Define the 'is_integer()' and 'holds_integer()' functions properly if they are custom functions.
2. Replace the usage of 'is_integer()' and 'holds_integer()' with standard Python functions or methods that perform similar actions.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.is_integer():
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                "can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
        elif not isinstance(i, int) and ax.is_integer():
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```
