The error occurs in the `_convert_key` method of the `_AtIndexer` class. The logic within this method is attempting to convert the input key before performing a series of checks, and if the conditions are not met, a ValueError is raised.

The key issue with the current logic is that it does not properly handle the cases where the key is a float or an integer, leading to the ValueError being raised incorrectly.

To fix this bug, the `_convert_key` method should be updated to handle the cases where the key is a float or an integer. This can be done by modifying the conditions and checks within the method.

Here's the corrected version of the `_convert_key` method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if not ax.is_floating():
            if not np.issubdtype(type(i), np.integer):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not np.issubdtype(type(i), np.floating):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing can only have floating point indexers"
                )
    return key
```

In this version, the method first checks if the index is of floating point type. If it is, then the key is checked to ensure that it is also of floating point type. If the index is not floating point type, then the key is checked to ensure that it is of integer type. These checks handle both the cases where the input key is a float or an integer, and the ValueError is raised only if the conditions are not met, as intended.
