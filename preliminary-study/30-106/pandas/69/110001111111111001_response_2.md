The bug is located in the `_convert_key` function in the `pandas/core/indexing.py` file. The function is throwing a `ValueError` when handling the input parameters.

The error occurs because the `_convert_key` function is supposed to ensure that the keys are of the same type as the index. However, it incorrectly checks whether the index is an integer or non-integer, and the key is an integer, without considering floating-point numbers.

To fix this bug, the `_convert_key` function should properly handle floating-point numbers as well as integers, and check for the correct type based on the index.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() or ax.is_floating():
            if not is_integer(i) and not is_float(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer/floating index "
                    "can only have integer/floating indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not ax.is_integer() and not ax.is_floating():
                if is_integer(i) or is_float(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer/floating "
                        "index can only have non-integer/floating "
                        "indexers"
                    )
    return key
```

With these changes, the `_convert_key` function should now properly handle both integer and floating-point keys based on the type of the index. This should resolve the `ValueError` that was occurring during the test cases.
