1. The error message is indicating that there is an issue with the `_convert_key` method in the `pandas.core.indexing` module. The method is not correctly handling the datetime-like values in the test case, which is causing a ValueError to be raised.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the `for` loop in the `_convert_key` method where it checks the type of the index against the type of the key. This is where the ValueError is being raised.

3. The bug is occurring because the `_convert_key` method is not handling the conversion of keys properly for datetime-like values when accessing the index by the `at` method.

4. To fix the bug, the `_convert_key` method needs to be updated to handle datetime-like values correctly. This could involve checking the type of the index against the type of the key and allowing the conversion to the appropriate type.

5. Below is the corrected code for the `pandas.core.indexing` module:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index (so we don't fallback).
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_datetimelike():
            if not is_datetimelike(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a datetime index can only have datetime indexers"
                )
        elif ax.is_timedelta():
            if not is_timedelta(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a timedelta index can only have timedelta indexers"
                )
        else:
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                    )

    return key
```

In the corrected code, we have added checks for datetime-like and timedelta-like indices, ensuring that the keys being accessed with the `at` method match the type of the index.
