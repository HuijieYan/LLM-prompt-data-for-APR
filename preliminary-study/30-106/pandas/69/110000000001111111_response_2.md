The buggy function _convert_key has an issue with the condition to check if the index is integer or not. The bug is occurring because of incorrect method calls and conditions. The method is_integer is being called on ax (which is the index), but the function is_integer should be called on i, the item being checked.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the condition to check if the item 'i' is an integer or not, based on the index type. We also need to handle the case where the index is not numeric.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)
    
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if hasattr(i, 'dtype') and i.dtype.kind in 'biufc':
            if ax.is_type_compatible(i):
                continue
            elif ax.is_integer() and i.dtype.kind in 'biu':
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
            elif ax.is_floating() and i.dtype.kind in 'f':
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
        else:
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                "index can only have non-integer "
                "indexers"
            )
    return key
```

In the corrected function, we first check if the item 'i' has a dtype attribute and if its kind is numeric. If it is, we check if it is compatible with the index type. If not, we raise a ValueError based on the index type and the kind of 'i'.

This modification should fix the bug and handle the corner cases in the function.
