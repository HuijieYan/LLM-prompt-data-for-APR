The buggy function `_convert_key` is supposed to check if the keys match the type of the index and return a list if it's a setter. However, the function is not correctly implementing this logic, leading to bugs in various test cases.

The bug occurs because the function attempts to check if the index is an integer or non-integer based on the type of the key, but it fails to handle all the cases correctly.

To fix this bug, we need to update the function to correctly handle different scenarios. We should check the data type of the index and the key, and then perform the appropriate checks to ensure compatibility.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    index_type = type(self.obj.index)
    key_type = type(key)
    if index_type != key_type:
        raise TypeError("Keys should be of the same type as the index")

    return key
```

This updated code first checks if it's a setter, and if so, it returns the keys as a list. If not, it compares the types of the index and keys and raises a `TypeError` if they are not the same. Otherwise, it returns the key as is, indicating that they are compatible.
