The error occurs in the `_convert_key` function. This function is supposed to convert the key based on the specified conditions, but it is not performing this task properly.

The bug occurs because the condition `if is_integer(i)` is likely not referring to the correct function, and should instead be a call to `is_integer` on the object `i`. Additionally, the condition `if not is_integer(i)` should also be checked for a different situation, likely specifying `if not isinstance(i, int)` instead. This would resolve the bug related to non-integer indexes.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index (so we don't fallback).
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At-based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
            raise ValueError(
                "At-based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```

This corrected code includes the necessary checks and conditions to handle different types of indexes and indexers.
