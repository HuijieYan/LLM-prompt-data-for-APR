The potential error in the provided code is in the `_convert_key` function. The function is intended to enforce the key to be of the same type as the index, but it has some issues with the validation logic.

The bug occurs due to incorrect validation of integer and non-integer indexes. The current logic has issues with checking if the index is an integer or not, and this can lead to incorrect error messages or incorrect behavior when setting or getting values in the DataFrame.

To fix the bug, the key should be validated against the index type. If the index is an integer type, then the keys should also be integer type, and vice versa.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, IntegerIndex):
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                    "can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

In the corrected code, we check for the index type using `isinstance` and then perform the appropriate validation on the keys. This ensures that the keys are compatible with the index type, preventing any potential issues.
