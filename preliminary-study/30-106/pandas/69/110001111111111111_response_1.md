The bug occurs in the `_convert_key` method of the `pandas.core.indexing` module. The method is designed to require the keys to be the same type as the index. It currently has issues with handling non-integer indexes when performing float64-based indexing.

The error message indicates that when the `is_integer` check fails, it still expects `i` to be an integer, which causes a ValueError when not met.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic of the `_convert_key` method. We can modify the condition for the non-integer index scenario to properly handle float-based indexing.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not isinstance(i, ax.dtype.type):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This updated implementation checks if the index is non-integer and then verifies if the key `i` is of the same type as the index. If it's not, it raises a ValueError.

This should address the corner cases in DTI.get_value and Float64Index.get_value for Series lookups with Float64Index-based indexing.
