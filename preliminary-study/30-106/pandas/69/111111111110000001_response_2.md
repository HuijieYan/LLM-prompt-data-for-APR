Upon analyzing the error message and the test, we can observe that the error is occurring in the `_convert_key` method. Specifically, the error is raised when checking for `ax.holds_integer()` and comparing the integer status of the index with the provided key.

The bug occurs because the code incorrectly checks if the key is an integer using `is_integer` as a method, which it is not. Also, there is a typo in the error message. 

To fix this bug, we can use the `isinstance` method to check if the key is an integer.

Here is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, (int, np.integer)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, (int, np.integer)) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```
