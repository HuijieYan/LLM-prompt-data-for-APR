The error occurs in the `_convert_key` method in the `pandas/core/indexing.py` file. This method is designed to check if the keys are of the same type as the index, but it fails to handle the case where the keys are non-integer and the index is `Float64Index`.

The reason behind this bug is that the method does not have a specific check for `Float64Index` and does not handle non-integer keys properly when the index is of this type.

To fix this bug, you can add a specific condition to handle `Float64Index` and check for non-integer keys in this case.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, (float, np.floating)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a Float64Index can only have floating point indexers"
                )
        elif ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

In the corrected code, we added a specific condition for `Float64Index` to check if the index is of this type and handle non-integer keys accordingly. This should resolve the issue and the test cases should pass without errors.
