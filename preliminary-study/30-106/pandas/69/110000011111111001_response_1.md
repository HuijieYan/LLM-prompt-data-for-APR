The error occurs when the function `_convert_key` tries to convert the `key` parameter. The main reason for the error is that the function does not handle non-integer keys properly, leading to a `ValueError` to be raised.

To fix the bug, the function `_convert_key` needs to handle non-integer keys correctly. This could be done by checking the type of the index and the keys, and then handling the conversion or type checking accordingly.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):

        # Check if the index is of type 'datetime64' or 'timedelta64'
        if isinstance(ax, (pd.DatetimeIndex, pd.TimedeltaIndex)):
            if not isinstance(i, (pd.Timestamp, pd.Timedelta)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a datetime/timedelta index can only have datetime/timedelta indexers"
                )
        else:
            # For other index types
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )

    return key
```

The corrected function now properly checks the type of the index and the keys, and raises a `ValueError` if the types do not match as expected.
