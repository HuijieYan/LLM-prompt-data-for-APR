The bug seems to be in the `_convert_key` function. The function checks whether the values in the `key` parameter match the type of the index it's being used with. In the buggy behavior, it's not handling the case where the index is a `Float64Index`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not handling the case where the index is a `Float64Index` and the input values are floats accordingly.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the `Float64Index` case and check for float data types when the index is a `Float64Index`. We can do this by using `pd.api.types.is_float_dtype()` to check if the values in the key are of float type when the index is a `Float64Index`.

Here's the corrected implementation of the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            if not pd.api.types.is_float(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a float index can only have float indexers"
                )
        elif ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This fix adds a check for the `Float64Index` type and then uses `pd.api.types.is_float_dtype()` to check if the values in the key are of float type when the index is a `Float64Index`. If they are not, an appropriate ValueError is raised.
