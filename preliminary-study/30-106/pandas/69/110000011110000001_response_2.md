The error message indicates that there is a ValueError being raised within the `_convert_key` method of the `pandas` library. The error specifically states that "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers". This suggests that there is an issue with the validation of the index type and indexers being used.

The bug likely occurs because the `_convert_key` method is not handling the non-integer indexers properly. It should be checking for non-integer indexers on non-integer indexes, but it seems to be incorrectly raising an error in cases where it should not. This is likely leading to the test cases failing when they shouldn't.

To fix this bug, the `_convert_key` method should be modified to properly handle the validation of index types and indexers. This can be achieved by first checking the type of the index and then performing the validation of indexers accordingly. When the index is non-integer, only non-integer indexers should be allowed.

Here's the corrected `_convert_key` method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index, so we don't fallback
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

By making this change, the `_convert_key` method will properly handle the validation of index types and indexers, fixing the bug and allowing the test cases to pass as expected.
