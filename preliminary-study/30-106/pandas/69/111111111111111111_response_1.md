Potential Error Location:
The issue appears to be in the `_convert_key` method of the `_AtIndexer` class in the file `pandas/core/indexing.py`.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `_convert_key` method is not correctly handling the case where the index is a `Float64Index`. The method does not handle integer and non-integer values appropriately.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the index is a `Float64Index` and handle integer and non-integer values separately.
2. Update the logic to account for different index types and their corresponding value types.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index so that we don't fallback.
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            if int(i) != i:
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a float index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if i % 1 != 0:
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-float index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code checks the type of the index and handles integer and non-integer values accordingly, addressing the bug in the original function.
