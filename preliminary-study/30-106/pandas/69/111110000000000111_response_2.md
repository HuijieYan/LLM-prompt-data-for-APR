Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the for loop where it checks the type of the index and the type of the key.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug is likely occurring because the function is not handling the cases where the index and key types do not match correctly. It is not properly checking for integer types in the key and index, leading to the incorrect value being returned.

Approach for fixing the bug: The function should properly handle cases where the index and key types do not match, and it should perform type checks in a more robust way.

Corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not ax.is_integer() and isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```
In the corrected code:
- We properly check if the index is an integer and if the key is of type int using the isinstance() function.
- We use proper if-elif-else conditions to handle the different cases of index and key types.
- We provide clear error messages to help with debugging.
