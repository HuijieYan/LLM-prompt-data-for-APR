Potential bug location:
The bug is occurring when the function is iterating through the axes and checking the type of the index against the type of each key. It then checks whether the index or the key is an integer or non-integer and raises a ValueError if the conditions are not met.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. The bug may occur due to the presence of non-functional method calls such as `ax.is_integer()`, `is_integer(i)`, `ax.holds_integer()`, and `ax.is_floating()` which should instead be called as boolean attributes like `ax.is_integer`, `is_integer`, `ax.holds_integer`, and `ax.is_floating`.
2. The bug may also occur because the function uses the `is_integer()` and `holds_integer()` methods, which do not exist on the `Index` object or `Series`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the method calls to use boolean attribute access rather than method invocations.
2. If the `is_integer()` and `holds_integer()` methods do not exist on the `Index` object or `Series`, then either create these methods or use an alternative method for checking the type of the index and key.

Corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(i, int) and not isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not isinstance(i, int) and not isinstance(ax, (pd.Float64Index, pd.DatetimeIndex, pd.TimedeltaIndex)):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```
