The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional check for whether `ax` is an integer or not. It seems like there might be a typo in the condition.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the conditional check for `ax` being an integer is incorrect, and as a result, it is not handling cases where `ax` is not an integer as expected.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to correct the conditional check for `ax` being an integer and handle the cases where it is not an integer.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index) or isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

In this corrected code, we are explicitly checking if `ax` is an `Int64Index` or `Float64Index` and then handling the cases accordingly. We are also checking if the indexer `i` is an integer or not and raising the ValueError as per the requirements.
