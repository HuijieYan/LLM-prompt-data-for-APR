The error occurs in the `_convert_key` method of the `_AtIndexer` class. The error is triggered by the line `result = ser.at[4]`.

The bug occurs because the `_convert_key` method is not correctly handling non-integer indexers. This method is supposed to require that keys be the same type as the index (so there is no fallback). It is currently checking for integer indexers, but it should also handle non-integer indexers.

To fix this bug, the `_convert_key` method should be updated to handle non-integer indexers correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    f"At based indexing on an integer index {type(self.index)} can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_integer(i) and not is_bool(i) and not is_string(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    f"At based indexing on a non-integer index {type(self.index)} can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```
