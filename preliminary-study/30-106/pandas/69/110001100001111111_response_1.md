The buggy function `_convert_key` is designed to convert keys to the same type as the index, but it has a logical error in the validation process. The bug occurs because the function is incorrectly checking whether the key is an integer, instead of checking whether the element of the key is an integer.

Based on the provided input variable values, it seems that the function is wrongly identifying the type of the key element, leading to the incorrect validation checks.

To fix this bug, the function should loop through the elements of the key, then check each element to see if it's an integer based on the index type. The corrected code for the function is as follows:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index.
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_numeric() and not is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a numeric index can only have numeric indexers"
            )
        if not ax.is_numeric() and is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-numeric index can only have non-numeric indexers"
            )  
    return key
```

In the corrected code, I changed the condition from `ax.is_integer()` to `ax.is_numeric()` to handle numeric indexes, and added appropriate checks for integer type. This will ensure that the validation is done at the element level, rather than assuming the entire key is of a specific type.
