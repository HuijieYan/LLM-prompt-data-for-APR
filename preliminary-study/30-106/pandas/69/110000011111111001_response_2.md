The bug is occurring in the `_convert_key` method. The function is checking whether indices are integers or non-integers, but the logic has inconsistencies and it is prone to raising a `ValueError`. The error message indicates that the issue may be related to invalid handling of non-integer indexes.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `_convert_key` method to correctly handle cases where the index is an integer or non-integer. Additionally, we need to verify the type of `i` and handle the cases accordingly.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This updated function uses `isinstance` to check the type of `i` and raises a `ValueError` accordingly, addressing the potential issues identified in the provided error messages.
