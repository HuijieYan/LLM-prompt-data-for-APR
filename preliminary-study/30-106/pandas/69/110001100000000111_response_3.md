Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is in the conversion of the key in the function `_convert_key` when the index is a Float64Index.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not correctly handle the case when the index is a Float64Index, leading to incorrect conversions and resulting in Series lookups being affected.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the type of the index and handle Float64Index separately.
2. Ensure that the conversion of the key is handled correctly for all types of indexes.

Corrected Code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        else:
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
    return key
