Potential Error Location:
The issue seems to be occurring in the `_convert_key` method from the `pandas/core/indexing.py` file. Specifically, there are checks for integer values and non-integer values within the index, and the bug is related to how these checks are handled.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug is occurring because the `_convert_key` method is not handling non-integer values properly when it should be handling them in a different way than integer values.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the logic that checks for integer and non-integer values to handle them differently and appropriately.
2. Ensure that the method can distinguish between different types of index values and handle them accordingly.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if pd.api.types.is_integer(i) and not pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype(ax):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
In the corrected code, the key type is checked using `pd.api.types.is_integer` and `pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype` in order to handle integer and non-integer index values appropriately.
