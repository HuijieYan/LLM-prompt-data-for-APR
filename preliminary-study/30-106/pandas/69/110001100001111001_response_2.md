```
The original code does not correctly check the compatibility of the key with the index. It fails to use the `isinstance` method to check if the keys are of the same type as the index and the `is_floating` method to check if the index is not integer-based.

The corrected code uses the `isinstance` method to check if the key is of the same type as the index and refactors the comparisons to use `isinstance` and `is_floating()` methods to correctly identify the compatibility.

The corrected function ensures that for integer-based indexes, only integer key indexes are allowed, and for non-integer indexes, only non-integer key indexes are allowed.
