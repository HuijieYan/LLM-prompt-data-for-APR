Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the part of the function that checks whether the index and key are of the same type.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug is likely occurring because the function is not properly handling the case where the index and key are not of the same type. This leads to the function incorrectly raising a ValueError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: One possible approach for fixing the bug is to check the type of the index and key at the beginning of the function and handle cases where they are not the same type. Additionally, the function can be modified to handle different types of indexes (integer, float, etc.) and perform appropriate validations based on the type.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    index_type = type(self.obj.index)
    key_type = type(key)

    if index_type != key_type:
        raise ValueError("Index and key must be of the same type")

    if index_type == pd.Float64Index:
        for i in key:
            if not isinstance(i, (int, float)):
                raise ValueError("Invalid key type for Float64Index")
    elif index_type == pd.DatetimeIndex:
        for i in key:
            if not isinstance(i, (datetime, pd.Timestamp)):
                raise ValueError("Invalid key type for DatetimeIndex")
    elif index_type == pd.TimedeltaIndex:
        for i in key:
            if not isinstance(i, timedelta):
                raise ValueError("Invalid key type for TimedeltaIndex")

    return key
```
In the corrected code, we first check if the index and key are of the same type. Then, based on the type of the index, we perform appropriate validations for the key to ensure that it is of the correct type. This approach will handle different types of indexes and keys and perform the necessary validations.
