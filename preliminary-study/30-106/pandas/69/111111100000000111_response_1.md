The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic used to check the type of the index and the key being used for indexing.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the logic used to check the type of the index and the key is not handling all corner cases properly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add additional checks for corner cases where the index and key may not match in type.
2. Use appropriate conditionals to handle both integer and non-integer cases for the index and key.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
