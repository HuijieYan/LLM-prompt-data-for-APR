The buggy function `_convert_key` takes in a key and a boolean flag `is_setter`. It iterates through the axes of the object `self.obj` and checks whether the index is based on integer or non-integer values and if the key values are integer or non-integer. If any inconsistencies are found, it raises a ValueError.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where the index is based on datetime or timedelta data types and it only checks for integer or non-integer values.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to check for the data type of the index and the key, and raise a ValueError if there are any inconsistencies.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    # Check the data type of the index
    index_type = type(self.obj.index)

    # Iterate through the axes and check for inconsistency between index and key data types
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(index_type, pd.DatetimeIndex):  # Check if index is based on datetime
            if not isinstance(i, pd.Timestamp):  # Check if key is a timestamp
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on a datetime index can only have datetime indexers")
        elif isinstance(index_type, pd.TimedeltaIndex):  # Check if index is based on timedelta
            if not isinstance(i, pd.Timedelta):  # Check if key is a timedelta
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on a timedelta index can only have timedelta indexers")
        elif ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

In the corrected function, we first check the type of the index and then based on the type, we handle the key type validation accordingly. If inconsistencies are found, we raise a ValueError with an appropriate error message. This modification ensures that the function can handle different data types for the index and the key and raise appropriate errors.
