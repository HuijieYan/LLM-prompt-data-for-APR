Potential error location: The error could be occurring in the if-else statements where the function is checking if the index is an integer or not.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug is occurring because the function is not handling the case where the index is not of the same type as the axes of the object.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the type of the index against the type of the axes and handle the mismatch appropriately.
2. Use isinstance() to check if the index is of the same type as the axes.
3. Raise a ValueError if the types do not match.

Corrected code:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
