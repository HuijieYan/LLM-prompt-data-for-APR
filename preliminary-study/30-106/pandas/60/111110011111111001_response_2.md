The error message indicates that the `assert_series_equal` is failing, meaning that the `result` series is not equal to the `expected` series.

I have identified the potential error location to be within the `apply` method of the `Rolling_and_Expanding` class. The bug seems to be related to the `apply` method's inability to handle the `raw` parameter correctly when the engine is set to `'cython'`.

The bug occurs because the `apply` method in the `Rolling_and_Expanding` class does not handle the `raw` parameter properly when the engine is set to `'cython'`. From the provided code, it seems that the `raw` parameter is not being passed correctly to the `_generate_cython_apply_func` function, which may be causing the observed failures in the test case.

To fix the bug, the `raw` parameter should be properly handled and passed to the `_generate_cython_apply_func` function when the engine is set to `'cython'. Additionally, the `raw` parameter should be validated to ensure it is of type `bool` as per the signature of the `apply` method.

Below is the corrected code for the `apply` method of the `Rolling_and_Expanding` class:

```python
def apply(
    self,
    func,
    raw: bool = False,
    engine: str = "cython",
    engine_kwargs: Optional[Dict] = None,
    args: Optional[Tuple] = None,
    kwargs: Optional[Dict] = None,
):
    if args is None:
        args = ()
    if kwargs is None:
        kwargs = {}
    kwargs.pop("_level", None)
    kwargs.pop("floor", None)
    window = self._get_window()
    offset = calculate_center_offset(window) if self.center else 0
    if not isinstance(raw, bool):  # Validate that raw is of type bool
        raise ValueError("raw parameter must be `True` or `False`")

    if engine == "cython":
        if engine_kwargs is not None:
            raise ValueError("cython engine does not accept engine_kwargs")
        apply_func = self._generate_cython_apply_func(
            args, kwargs, raw, offset, func
        )
    # ... (code for handling other engine types)
    return self._apply(
        apply_func,
        center=False,
        floor=0,
        name=func,
        use_numba_cache=engine == "numba",
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `raw` parameter is validated, and it is correctly passed to the `_generate_cython_apply_func` function when the engine is set to `'cython'. This should address the issues observed in the test case and ensure that the `apply` method functions as expected.
