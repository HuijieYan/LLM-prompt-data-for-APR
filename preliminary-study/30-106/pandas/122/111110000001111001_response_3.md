The provided function seems to be comparing two instances of the BlockManager class. The error is likely caused by the way the "equals" function is implemented, as it attempts to check equality by comparing different attributes and properties of the BlockManager class.

To fix this bug, the "equals" function should be modified to compare individual attributes and properties of the BlockManager instances. It should check the equality of "axes", "blocks", and possibly other relevant attributes to determine if the two instances are equal.

Here's the corrected "equals" function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    # Compare the axes
    if self.axes != other.axes:
        return False

    # Ensure that the blocks are consolidated before comparison
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    # Compare the consolidated blocks to check for equality
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    for self_block, other_block in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False

    return True
```
