In the given test case, the `assert` statement is checking if `df1.equals(df2)` is `False`. However, the error message indicates that it is evaluating to `True` instead. This suggests that there is a bug in the implementation of the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class.

The potential location of the bug is likely to be in the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class, specifically in the section where it compares the blocks of two instances.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be due to incorrect comparison logic for the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic for the blocks of the two instances should be updated to consider the content of the blocks and their respective labels. Additionally, any sorting or canonicalization of the blocks should be performed before the comparison.

Here is the corrected implementation of the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist(), block.get_values())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected implementation, a custom `canonicalize` function is defined to return a combined tuple of the block's locations and values. The blocks are then sorted based on this tuple before comparison. The comparison includes the values of the blocks to ensure an accurate comparison.

After applying this fix, the `equals` method should be able to correctly compare two instances of `BlockManager`, resolving the bug observed in the test case.
