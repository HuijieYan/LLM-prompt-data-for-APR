The test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` is comparing two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` to check if they are equal. The expected result is `False` since the DataFrames have different data. However, the test is failing because the `equals` method is returning `True` instead of `False`.

The issue is likely occurring inside the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class. The function is not correctly comparing the blocks within the DataFrames, leading to an incorrect result.

The bug is occurring because the function is not properly handling the comparison of different blocks within the DataFrames, ultimately leading to an incorrect result.

To fix the bug, the `equals` function needs to be revised to correctly compare all blocks within the DataFrames and return the appropriate boolean result.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
# Fix for the buggy equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code includes proper handling for comparing individual blocks within the DataFrames, ensuring that the `equals` function returns the correct result.

With this fix, the test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` should now pass, and the `equals` method should return the expected result of `False` for the provided input DataFrames.
