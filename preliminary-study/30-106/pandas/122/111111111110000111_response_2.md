The test case `test_dataframe_not_equal()` is checking whether two dataframes `df1` and `df2` are equal using the `equals` method. The test is expecting the result of `df1.equals(df2)` to be `False`, but it is actually returning `True`.

The potential error location within the `BlockManager` class is the `equals` method. The bug occurs because the `equals` method is sorting the blocks and then comparing them. If there are identical blocks with different locations, the method may return `True` when it should return `False`.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `equals` method to compare the blocks without sorting them. This will ensure that the method accurately checks for equality between dataframes.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(other.blocks[i]) for i, block in enumerate(self.blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the `equals` method should accurately compare the dataframes for equality without sorting the blocks.
