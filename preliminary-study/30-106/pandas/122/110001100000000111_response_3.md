Potential error location:
The bug appears to be in the `equals` function, where it is incorrectly returning True for the comparison of two DataFrames with different column types and values.

Reasons behind the bug:
The `equals` function is not handling the comparison of DataFrames with different column types and values properly. It is incorrectly evaluating them as equal in some cases where they should not be.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `equals` function to properly handle comparisons of DataFrames with different column types and values.
2. Consider implementing a different method for comparing DataFrames that takes into account differences in column types and values.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort the blocks by column type and location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
  
    # Check if the sorted blocks are equal
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
