Potential error location:
The issue seems to be in the `equals` function where there is a check for equality of blocks. The function does not consider the possibility that identical blocks might have different locations.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The `equals` function does not take into account that two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations should not be considered equal. The comparison logic only considers the values and types of the blocks, without taking into account their positions.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check for identical blocks and their positions when comparing the DataFrames in the `equals` function.
2. Use a sorting mechanism to handle different block locations before comparing the DataFrames for equality.

Corrected code:
```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        # Sorting blocks by type name and mgr_locs to handle different block locations
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```
