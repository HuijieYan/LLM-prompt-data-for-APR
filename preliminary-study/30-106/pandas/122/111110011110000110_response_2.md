# A GitHub issue title for the corrected bug
```text
Fix DataFrame.equals() to correctly differentiate between identical blocks with different locations
```

## The associated detailed issue description
```text
I have corrected the BlockManager class to address the issue with the DataFrame.equals() method incorrectly returning True for identical blocks with different locations. The corrected code includes changes to the equals() method within the BlockManager class, ensuring it correctly differentiates between blocks with different locations.

I have also provided a test function to validate the corrected equals() method and ensure it now returns False as expected for identical blocks with different locations.

Please review the changes and consider merging them to fix the issue with DataFrame.equals().

Thank you.
