The issue here is with the `equals` function in the pandas library. The function is expected to compare two DataFrames and return True if they are equal, and False if they are not. However, it is mistakenly returning True in cases where the blocks have identical data but are located in different positions.

The potential error location within the `equals` function is in the block where it sorts the blocks and then compares them. When sorting the blocks, the function uses a `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks based on their data type and location. This can lead to two identical blocks being sorted differently just because they are in different locations, causing the `equals` function to return True incorrectly.

To fix the bug, the sorting of the blocks needs to be updated to compare the blocks based on their content, rather than their location. This can be achieved by removing the `canonicalize` function and instead sorting the blocks directly based on their content.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected code, the `equals` function should now properly compare the blocks based on their content, rather than their location, and return the correct result.
