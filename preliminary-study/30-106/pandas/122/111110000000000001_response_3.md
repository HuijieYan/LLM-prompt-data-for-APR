Potential Error Location:

The potential error is in the `equals` method where the code is trying to compare the blocks of two `BlockManager` objects.

Reason for the Bug:

The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function is defined outside the `equals` method, resulting in a NameError when the function is called within the `equals` method.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:

1. Define the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` method to ensure it is accessible within the method.
2. Remove the `canonicalize` function and directly perform the sorting and comparison of blocks within the `equals` method.

Corrected Code:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # replace the canonicalize function with direct sorting and comparison
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
