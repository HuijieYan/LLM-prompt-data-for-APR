The error occurs in the `equals` method of the `DataFrame` class. When comparing two DataFrames using the `equals` method, it wrongly returns `True` even if the DataFrames have identical blocks with different locations.

The potential location of the error is in how the `canonicalize` function is used to sort and compare the block data within the DataFrames. The sorting logic might not be considering all aspects of the block data for comparison, leading to the incorrect result.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function properly captures all relevant information for sorting the blocks. Additionally, we should also consider whether there are any other conditions that need to be checked for the comparison to be accurate.

Here's the corrected `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axis = self.axes
    other_axis = other.axes
    if len(self_axis) != len(other_axis):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axis, other_axis)):
        return False
    
    # Consolidate blocks inplace before comparison
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self._mgr.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Used to canonicalize block order for sorting
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.index, block.columns)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) and
        block.index.equals(oblock.index) and
        block.columns.equals(oblock.columns)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected code, the `canonicalize` function takes into account the block values, index, and columns for sorting and comparison. Additionally, the comparison logic now checks for equality of values, index, and columns of the blocks to ensure accurate comparison between the DataFrames.
