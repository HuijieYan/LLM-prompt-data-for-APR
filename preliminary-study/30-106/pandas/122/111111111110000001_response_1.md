The test_dataframe_not_equal() test case demonstrates the issue by creating two DataFrames (df1 and df2) with the same columns but different data. The test then calls the equals() method on df1 with df2 as the argument, expecting it to return False. However, the error message indicates that the assertion failed, with the `assert df1.equals(df2)` line evaluating to `False is True`.

The issue seems to be in the equals() method of the BlockManager class. The problematic part of the equals() method is where it compares the blocks of one DataFrame with another. The method is not handling mixed data types properly in the comparison of DataFrames.

The bug occurs because the original code does not account for the comparison of DataFrames containing mixed data types. As a result, the comparison does not yield the expected result.

To fix the bug, we can modify the equals() method to handle mixed data types appropriately. We should consider the data types when performing the comparison and make necessary adjustments for equality checks.

Below is the corrected code for the equals() method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtypes), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In the corrected code, we use `str(block.dtypes)` to include the data types in canonicalization, which helps in the comparison of DataFrames with mixed data types. This modification ensures that the equals() method handles DataFrames with mixed data types appropriately.
