The test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` is comparing two DataFrames to check if they are not equal, and it's expecting `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False`. However, the actual error message indicates that it's returning `True` instead.

The potential error in the `equals` function is the sorting of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on a key function `canonicalize`. This key function is supposed to uniquely identify the blocks to compare, but it is not returning the correct unique identifier.

The issue occurs because the `canonicalize` function should return a tuple of the `dtype` name and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, but it's not returning the `dtype` name correctly, and it should also handle unconsolidated blocks like Categorical data type.

To fix the bug:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to accurately return a unique identifier for the blocks by considering the data type (`dtype` name) and the block locations (`mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`).

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now return the correct result when comparing different DataFrames for equality.
