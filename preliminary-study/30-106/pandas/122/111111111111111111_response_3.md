Based on the error message from the test function and the provided variable runtime values, it seems that the `equals` method is returning `True` incorrectly when it should be returning `False` for the given input dataframes. This is likely due to an issue with the comparison logic inside the `equals` method.

The problem lies in the `equals` method where block consolidation and comparison logic are flawed. The `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks is not returning the correct tuple, leading to incorrect comparisons between blocks. Additionally, the comparison between `self_axes` and `other_axes` is not properly handled.

To fix this bug, the `canonicalize` function should correctly combine the type name and `mgr_locs` to ensure that blocks are distinguished correctly. Moreover, the comparison logic for `self_axes` and `other_axes` might need to be re-evaluated to ensure the correct comparison.

Here's the corrected `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

With these corrections, the `equals` method will correctly handle the comparison of blocks, ensuring that the correct output is returned for the given input dataframes. This should resolve the issue highlighted in the GitHub bug report.
