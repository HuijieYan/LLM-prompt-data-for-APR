The test case compares two dataframes, `df1` and `df2`, and expects the `equals` function to return `False` since the two dataframes have different values in their cells. However, the error message shows that the `equals` function is returning `True` instead of `False`.

The potential error location within the function is likely in the comparison of blocks within the dataframes. It's possible that the function is not properly comparing the blocks with identical values but different locations.

The bug occurs because the function is not handling the comparison of identical blocks with different locations correctly. It may be sorting the blocks based on their location, leading to an incorrect comparison.

To fix the bug, the function should properly compare the blocks within the dataframes without being affected by their locations. This can be achieved by iterating through the blocks and comparing their content directly.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```
