The error in the `equals` method occurs because the method is not handling the comparison of the blocks correctly. The blocks are being compared without taking into account their order, which leads to incorrect comparison results.

To fix this issue, the blocks in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` need to be sorted based on their type name and `mgr_locs`. This will ensure that the blocks are canonicalized before comparison.

Here's the corrected `equals` method:

```python
# corrected equals method
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.__class__.__name__, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on their type name and locations, we ensure that they are canonicalized before comparison. This should resolve the issue with the `equals` method incorrectly returning `True` in some cases.
