The issue here is that the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is not comparing the blocks properly and may wrongly return True in case of identical blocks with different locations. This can lead to incorrect results when comparing DataFrames.

The potential error location is in the block comparison logic where it does not properly account for the order of the blocks and their locations.

The bug occurs because the function `equals` does not properly compare the blocks in different DataFrames when their locations are different, even if the content of the blocks is identical. This can lead to false positives in the comparison.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the block comparison logic to consider the actual content of the blocks while also accounting for their locations.

Here's the corrected function for the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # sort by label and dtype
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks.items(), key=lambda x: x[0])
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks.items(), key=lambda x: x[0])

    # compare sorted blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(other_blocks[i][1]) for i, (label, block) in enumerate(self_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected function compares the blocks in the DataFrames by sorting them based on their labels and then comparing the sorted blocks. This ensures that the comparison takes into account the actual content of the blocks while also considering their locations.
