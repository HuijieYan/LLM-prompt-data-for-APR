The issue in the `equals` method seems to be due to the comparison of blocks in a non-consolidated state, which causes the method to incorrectly return `True` when the blocks have the same data but are at different locations.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the blocks are consolidated before comparing them. We can achieve this by consolidating the blocks within the `equals` method before performing the block comparisons.

Here's the corrected `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    # Consolidate the blocks before comparison
    self_blocks = [blk.consolidate() for blk in self.blocks]
    other_blocks = [blk.consolidate() for blk in other.blocks]

    self_blocks = sorted(self_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By consolidating the blocks before comparison, we ensure that the comparison is based on the actual data rather than the location of the blocks. This should address the issue and ensure that the `equals` method works as expected.
