Potential error location: The bug might be in the equals function where it's trying to consolidate the blocks inplace and compare them.

Reason for the occurrence of the bug: The bug might be in the canonicalize function, where it needs to return a tuple combining the type name and then mgr_locs by calling the as_array method followed by the tolist method on the mgr_locs.

Approach for fixing the bug:
1. Update the canonicalize function to correctly return a tuple combining the type name and then mgr_locs by calling the as_array method followed by the tolist method on the mgr_locs.
2. Check the logic for consolidating the blocks inplace before comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
        
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Updated canonicalize function to return the tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
This corrected code incorporates the adjustments to the canonicalize function and ensures that the blocks are appropriately consolidated before comparison.
