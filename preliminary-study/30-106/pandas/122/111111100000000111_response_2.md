The test case provided (`df3.equals(df4)`) is expected to return False because the data in the dataframes `df3` and `df4` are different.

The potential error in the problematic function `equals` is within the canonicalization of the blocks. It seems that the function `canonicalize` is defined twice: once as a standalone function and once within the `BlockManager` class. This can cause confusion and can potentially lead to incorrect sorting and comparison of blocks.

The bug occurs because when trying to determine if two DataFrames are equal, the function first compares their axes and then performs canonicalization of the blocks. However, the canonicalization process might not identify blocks with the same values but different locations, leading to an incorrect conclusion that the DataFrames are equal.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to remove the redundant definition of the `canonicalize` function and ensure that the canonicalization accurately captures the identity of the blocks, including their values and locations.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Correctly canonicalize block order, taking into account the values and locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
