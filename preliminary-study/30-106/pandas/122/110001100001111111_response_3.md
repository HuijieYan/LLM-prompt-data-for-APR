The bug occurs in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. When comparing two `BlockManager` instances, the method incorrectly returns `True` even when the blocks have different locations.

The bug occurs because the method does not properly handle the comparison of blocks with different locations. In the original code, the `canonicalize` function is used to sort and compare the blocks, but it does not take into account the block locations.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function needs to be modified to include block locations in the comparison. Additionally, the comparison logic needs to be updated to properly handle blocks with different locations.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected code, the `canonicalize` function now includes the block locations in the comparison. This ensures that blocks with different locations are properly handled during the comparison.
