The error is likely located in the `equals` method of the DataFrame class since the error message mentions that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` returns `True` instead of `False`. This suggests that the `equals` method is not correctly identifying the differences between the two DataFrames `df1` and `df2`.

The bug occurs because the `equals` method is not handling the comparison of DataFrames with different block order correctly. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the block data to ensure that the order of blocks doesn't affect the comparison. However, the sorting logic inside `canonicalize` seems to be incorrect, and this could be causing the `equals` method to return an incorrect result.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be modified to properly sort the blocks before comparing them.

Here is the corrected `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By converting the `dtype.name` to a string and using `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to create a tuple for sorting, we can effectively compare the blocks within the DataFrames without being affected by their locations. This should fix the bug and ensure that the `equals` method returns the correct result.
