The given function, equals, is supposed to compare two instances of the BlockManager class. It calculates whether the two instances are equal based on their attributes and types. The functionality of the equals function is to return True if the two BlockManager instances are equal, or False if they are not.

The bug in the code is that the canonicalize function is defined twice within the class. This causes ambiguity, and one of the definitions is not used. The canonicalize function is then called, but it is unclear which definition is utilized. This can lead to incorrect results and make the code harder to maintain.

The corrected code should remove the second definition of the canonicalize function, thus resolving the ambiguity and making the code easier to understand and maintain.

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
