The bug seems to be occurring in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. This method is used to check if two `BlockManager` objects are equal. 

The bug seems to be happening because the method does not check the equality of the data in the blocks correctly. It compares the block indexes, but does not compare the actual data within the blocks.

To fix this bug, the `equals` method should compare the data within the blocks instead of just comparing the indexes and shapes of the blocks.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    # Consolidate the blocks
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    # Check the number of blocks
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare the data within the blocks
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        self_block_data = self.blocks[i].get_values()
        other_block_data = other.blocks[i].get_values()
        if not np.array_equal(self_block_data, other_block_data):
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected code, the data within each block is obtained using the `get_values()` method, and then it is compared using `np.array_equal` to check for equality.

With this change, the `equals` method should now correctly compare the data within the `BlockManager` objects and return whether they are equal or not.
