The error occurs because the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class does not compare the blocks of the two instances properly. It incorrectly returns `True` even when the blocks have identical values but different locations.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be defined outside the `equals` method. Another issue is that the `canonicalize` function is defined twice within the `equals` method, which is unnecessary. The comparison of blocks should be based on their actual values, not their locations.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected code, the `canonicalize` function has been removed, and the blocks are sorted based on their actual values. The comparison within the `all` function now directly checks if the values of the blocks are equal.

This fix ensures that the `equals` method returns `True` only when the two instances have exactly equal block values, even if those values are in different locations.
