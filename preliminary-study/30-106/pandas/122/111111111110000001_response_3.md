1. The test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` is checking if two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` are not equal using the `equals` method. The error message indicates that the assertion `df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the implementation of the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class. It seems like the comparison logic in the `equals` method is not working as expected.

3. The bug occurs because the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class is not correctly handling the comparison between two data blocks. As a result, the comparison logic returns `True` instead of `False` when comparing two different data blocks.

4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class to correctly perform the comparison between blocks. Additionally, we need to ensure that the comparison between DataFrames using the `equals` method behaves as expected.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_dtype_counts(), block.get_ftype_counts())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This fix updates the logic for canonicalizing the blocks using the `get_dtype_counts` and `get_ftype_counts` methods on each block, ensuring that the comparison between blocks is based on their actual content and type. This should resolve the incorrect comparison results experienced in the test case.
