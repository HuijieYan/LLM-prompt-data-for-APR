The buggy function is a method called `equals` which checks if two BlockManager instances are equal. The function fails with the given input data because it does not handle the comparison between columns in a DataFrame properly. The method `equals` is called on two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` and it fails because it compares the DataFrames using the `block.equals` method, which is not suitable for comparing DataFrames. 

To fix this bug, the `canonicalize` function must be modified to handle the comparison of DataFrames properly. This may involve comparing the columns of the DataFrames separately and then performing the comparison of the blocks.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare DataFrames separately
    for col1, col2 in zip(self, other):
        if not col1.equals(col2):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected code compares the columns of the DataFrames separately, ensuring that each column is appropriately compared before returning the final result.
