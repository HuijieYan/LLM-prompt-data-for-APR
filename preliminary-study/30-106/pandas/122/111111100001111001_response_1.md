## 1. Error Analysis
The current function is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` class and checking if the internals such as axes, blocks, and blocks placement are equal. 

## 2. Bug Location
The bug is located in the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class. The function attempts to compare different attributes of the `BlockManager` instances, but due to the inconsistency in block ordering and dtype, the comparison might produce incorrect results.

## 3. Reason behind the Bug
The bug is related to the inconsistency in block ordering which is not being handled properly. Additionally, there is no initial canonicalization of block ordering before comparison.

## 4. Approach to Fix
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Canonicalize the block order by defining a helper function to sort the blocks based on dtype and block placement.
2. Use this canonicalization to compare blocks within the `equals` function.

## 5. Corrected Code

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    # Check if all axes are equal
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Consolidating inplace 
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # helper function to canonicalize block ordering
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    # Sort the blocks using canonicalization
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare sorted blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
