The issue appears to be related to the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class. This function is used to compare two `BlockManager` objects and checks for equality in their axes, blocks, and their respective properties.

The bug seems to be occurring because the function is incorrectly comparing the `blocks` attribute of the `BlockManager` objects. It is sorting the `blocks` based on the output of the `canonicalize` function, but the `canonicalize` function is not correctly defined and is returning a tuple combining the `dtype.name` and the `mgr_locs` attribute, which is not appropriate for comparing equality.

To fix this bug, we need to redefine the `canonicalize` function to accurately represent and sort the `blocks`. We also need to ensure that the comparison of the blocks is done correctly.

The corrected code for the `equals` function is provided below:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(blocks):
        return tuple((block.mgr_locs, block.dtype.name) for block in blocks)
    
    self_blocks = canonicalize(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = canonicalize(other.blocks)
    
    return self_blocks == other_blocks
```

In this corrected code:
- We compare the axes and their properties first, and if they are not equal, we return False.
- We then consolidate the blocks in both `BlockManager` objects.
- Next, the `canonicalize` function is defined to correctly represent and sort the blocks based on `mgr_locs` and `dtype.name`.
- We use the `canonicalize` function to create tuples of block properties for both `BlockManager` objects and compare them directly. If they are equal, we return True; otherwise, we return False.
