The error occurs when the `equals` method is called on two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations, and it incorrectly returns True instead of False.

The potential error occurs at the following line:
```python
return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```
This is where the comparison of blocks is taking place, and the bug is likely in the logic of this comparison.

The bug occurs because the `equals` method is not taking into account the possibility of identical blocks with different locations. It needs to consider the block locations as well when comparing the DataFrames.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to modify the `equals` method to explicitly consider the block locations when comparing the DataFrames. This can be done by sorting the blocks based on their type name and location, and then comparing them one by one.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
