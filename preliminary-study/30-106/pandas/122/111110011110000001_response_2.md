The error message is showing that the `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` assertion is failing, indicating that `df1.equals(df2)` is returning `True` instead of `False`.

The potential error is likely within the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. The reason for the bug occurring is likely due to how the comparison between `df1` and `df2` is being performed within the `equals` method. It seems that the method is not correctly comparing the data within the two dataframes, leading to the wrong result being returned.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class to compare the content of the dataframes rather than the objects themselves.

Here's the corrected `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    for self_block, other_block in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not (self_block.values == other_block.values).all():
            return False
    
    return True
```

This updated method now compares the values within the blocks of the dataframes, ensuring that their content is being compared rather than just the objects themselves.
