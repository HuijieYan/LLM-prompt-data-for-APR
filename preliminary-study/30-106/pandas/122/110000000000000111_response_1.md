The bug in the equals() method occurs because when comparing DataFrames df3 and df4, the method incorrectly returns True even though the data in corresponding columns 'a' and 'b' are different.

The potential error location within the function is in the comparison of the blocks of the two DataFrames. The function is not correctly handling the comparison of blocks with different locations.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function does not properly handle the comparison of blocks with different locations, which leads to incorrect results when comparing DataFrames with different block locations.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the canonicalize() function to include the index values of the blocks, in addition to dtype name and mgr_locs, to ensure that blocks with identical data but different locations are not treated as equal.

The corrected code for the equals() method is as follows:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, mgr_locs, and index values to handle blocks with different locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.index.to_list())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code includes the index values of the blocks in the canonicalize() function, ensuring that blocks with identical data but different locations are not wrongly treated as equal.
