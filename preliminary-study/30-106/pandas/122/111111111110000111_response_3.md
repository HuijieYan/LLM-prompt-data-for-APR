The error occurs in the equals() function of the BlockManager class. When comparing two DataFrames using the equals() method, it returns True even when the DataFrames have identical blocks with different locations, which is incorrect.

The issue seems to be in the block comparison logic of the equals() function, where it does not handle the blocks' locations properly. This results in the incorrect True return when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

To fix the bug, the equals() function needs to handle the comparison of identical blocks with different locations correctly. This can be achieved by modifying the canonicalize function to consider the block locations when generating the canonicalized representation for comparison. The canonicalize function should take both dtype and the block's positions into account.

I also noticed that the canonicalize function is defined twice in the BlockManager class, which would lead to a conflict. The second canonicalize function should be removed as it is unnecessary.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic equals() function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With these modifications, the equals() function should now correctly compare two DataFrames and return False when they have identical blocks with different locations.
