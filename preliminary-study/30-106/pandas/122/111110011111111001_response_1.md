The potential error location within the `equals` function is in the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The comparison is based on the assumption that the order of blocks is the same in both `BlockManager` instances. This assumption is incorrect, and it causes the comparison to fail even when the data in the blocks is the same.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the comparison of blocks is not considering the possibility of different block orders in `self` and `other` `BlockManager` instances.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to compare the blocks based on their content rather than their order.

The corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize_blocks(blocks):
        sorted_blocks = sorted(blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values, block.mgr_locs.values))
        return [tuple(block.values) for block in sorted_blocks]

    self_canonical_blocks = canonicalize_blocks(self.blocks)
    other_canonical_blocks = canonicalize_blocks(other.blocks)

    return self_canonical_blocks == other_canonical_blocks
```

In the corrected code, the `canonicalize_blocks` function is introduced to sort and convert the `blocks` of both `BlockManager` instances into a canonical form based on their content. Then, the comparison is made based on the canonicalized forms of the blocks, ensuring that the comparison is independent of the order of the blocks.
