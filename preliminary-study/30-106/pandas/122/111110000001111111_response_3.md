The test case compares two DataFrames `df3` and `df4` using the `equals` method, expecting it to return False because the two DataFrames have their blocks in different locations. However, the `equals` method incorrectly returns True, indicating that the two DataFrames are identical.

The potential error location within the `equals` method is the section where it compares the blocks in the `self` and `other` DataFrames.

The bug occurs because the `equals` method fails to account for identical blocks with different locations. The comparison of blocks can lead to incorrect results when the block order is not consistent between `self` and `other`.

To fix the bug, the `equals` method needs to compare the blocks in a way that takes into account their actual content and order, rather than simply comparing their locations.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    self_blocks = list(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = list(other.blocks)
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for i, block in enumerate(self_blocks):
        if not block.equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False
    
    return True
```

In the corrected code, the comparison of blocks is done by iterating through each block and comparing them individually. This ensures that the content and order of the blocks are considered in the comparison, addressing the previous bug.
