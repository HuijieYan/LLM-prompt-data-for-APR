The error occurs when the `equals` method is called on two DataFrames, `df1` and `df2`, and it checks whether they are equal. The error message shows that the comparison of `df1` and `df2` using the `equals` method returns `True` instead of `False`, which leads to the assertion error.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the block where the `equals` method is implemented. The comparison logic seems to be incorrect, leading to the wrong result.

The bug occurs because the comparison logic inside the `equals` method is not correctly implemented. When comparing two DataFrames, the block order is being canonicalized, but this process is incorrect, leading to a wrong comparison result.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic inside the `equals` method needs to be revised. The canonicalization and comparison of blocks should be done correctly.

Here is the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
  
    # canonicalize block order, combining the type name and mgr_locs
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs))
  
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `canonicalize` function has been replaced with a lambda function directly inside the `sorted` function. This lambda function effectively combines the type name and `mgr_locs` of the block, ensuring correct canonicalization for comparison.
