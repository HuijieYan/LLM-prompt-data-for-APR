The error is occurring in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. The method is incorrectly returning `True` when it should be returning `False` for the given input values.

The issue seems to be related to the comparison of identical blocks with different locations. The buggy function's implementation fails to properly handle the comparison in such cases.

To fix the bug:
1. Check if the axes of the two BlockManagers are equal. If not, return `False`.
2. Consolidate the BlockManagers in place using the `_consolidate_inplace` method for both `self` and `other` BlockManagers.
3. Compare the lengths of the blocks in the BlockManagers. If they are not equal, return `False`.
4. Sort the blocks using a canonicalize function to ensure consistent comparison.
5. Compare each block in `self` with the corresponding block in `other`. If any pair of blocks are not equal, return `False`.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or self_axes != other_axes:
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` method should now return the correct result for the given inputs and the test case should pass without raising an assertion error.
