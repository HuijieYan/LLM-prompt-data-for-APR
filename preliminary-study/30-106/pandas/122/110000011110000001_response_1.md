Potential Error Location:
The error is likely occurring in the equals(self, other) method, which is not properly comparing the two DataFrames for equality.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug is occurring because the equals method is not properly comparing the two DataFrames. The method is trying to compare the internal axes and blocks of the DataFrames but is not handling the comparison of different data types and values within the DataFrames.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the equals method to compare the values within the DataFrames in addition to the axes and blocks.

Corrected Code:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, pd.DataFrame):
        return False

    if not self.index.equals(other.index):
        return False

    if not self.columns.equals(other.columns):
        return False

    return self.values.equals(other.values)
```

This corrected code compares the indices, columns, and values of the DataFrames to determine equality.
