Potential error location:
The issue appears to be in the `equals` method of the DataFrame class. The method is comparing two dataframes `self` and `other` and returning True if they are equal. However, the current implementation doesn't seem to handle the scenario where the blocks are identical but in different locations.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the `equals` method is not considering the case where the blocks are identical but in different locations. This is causing it to return True when it should be returning False.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
One approach to fix this bug is to modify the `equals` method to consider the case where the blocks are identical but in different locations. This can be achieved by comparing the blocks themselves rather than just their order.

Another approach could be to add a check for block location in the comparison logic to ensure that the blocks are exactly the same, regardless of their location.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) and block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
