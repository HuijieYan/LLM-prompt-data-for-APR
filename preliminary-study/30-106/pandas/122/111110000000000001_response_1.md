The potential error location within the `equals` function is the sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function is defined outside of the `equals` function, but it should be defined as a method within the `BlockManager` class.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that when sorting `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using the `canonicalize` function, the `canonicalize` function is not defined as a method within the `BlockManager` class, so it is not accessible within the `equals` function.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to define the `canonicalize` function as a method within the `BlockManager` class so that it can be called within the `equals` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
# corrected equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # define canonicalize as a method within the BlockManager class
    def canonicalize(self, block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: canonicalize(self, x))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: canonicalize(other, x))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
