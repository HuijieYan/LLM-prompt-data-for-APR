1. The test case `test_dataframe_not_equal()` is comparing two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` using the `equals` method. It expects the result to be `False`, but it fails with an assertion error.

2. The error is likely occurring in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class, where the comparison between the two DataFrames is performed.

3. The bug is occurring because the implementation of the `equals` method is not correctly handling the comparison between two DataFrames. It seems that the method is trying to compare the DataFrames at a lower level without considering the values within the DataFrames.

4. To fix the bug, the `equals` method should compare the values of the DataFrames along with their axes and other relevant properties. Additionally, it should handle the comparison based on the data in the DataFrames rather than their internal memory layout.

5. Corrected `equals` method for the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if not self.axes.equals(other.axes):
        return False
    if not self.values.equals(other.values):  # Compare the values of the DataFrames
        return False
    return True
```

This revised implementation compares the axes and the values of the DataFrames to determine if they are equal. Additionally, it returns `True` if the DataFrames are equal, and `False` otherwise.
