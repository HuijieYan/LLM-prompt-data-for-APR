The `equals` function currently has multiple issues that need to be addressed. 

The initial comparison of `len(self_axes)` and `len(other_axes)` may not be sufficient to determine if the objects are equal, as it does not take into account the order or specific values of the axes.

Additionally, the comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` does not properly handle cases where the blocks are in different locations but are otherwise identical, leading to an incorrect comparison result.

To fix these issues, we need to modify the comparison logic to consider the actual content and order of the axes and blocks, rather than just their lengths and positions.

The corrected function would look like this:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # handle comparison of blocks at different locations
    for i, (block, oblock) in enumerate(zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            # if blocks are not equal, check for matching blocks at other locations
            match_found = False
            for j in range(i, len(other.blocks)):
                if block.equals(other.blocks[j]):
                    other_blocks = list(other.blocks)
                    other_blocks[i], other_blocks[j] = other_blocks[j], other_blocks[i]
                    if self.equals(other_blocks):
                        return True
                    else:
                        match_found = True
                        break
            if not match_found:
                return False
    return True
```

This corrected function properly handles the comparison of axes and blocks, ensuring that identical blocks at different locations are also considered equal.
