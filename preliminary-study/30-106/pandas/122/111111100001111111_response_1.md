The issue occurs in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. The method compares two instances of `BlockManager` and their blocks for equality. 

The problem arises from the incorrect comparison of the blocks due to their different locations. When comparing the `blocks` attribute of `self` and `other`, the method does not consider the possibility that identical blocks may have different locations. This results in the method incorrectly returning True in cases where the blocks have the same contents but different locations.

To fix this issue, the comparison between blocks should take into account the possibility of different block locations. One way to address this is to refactor the comparison logic to consider the content of the blocks rather than their exact locations.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block content, using a tuple combining the block data and type name,
        # as identical blocks may have different locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values().data.tobytes(), block.dtype.name)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `canonicalize` function now combines the block content and dtype name into a tuple, which is used for sorting and comparison. This ensures that identical blocks with different locations are treated as equal when comparing `BlockManager` instances.
