The test case involves creating two DataFrames, df3 and df4, that have the same data but in a different order. The `equals` method is then used to compare the two DataFrames, and it is expected to return False due to the differing order of the data.

The potential error location within the `equals` method is the comparison of block equality between self_blocks and other_blocks. The sorting of the blocks and comparing their equality might not handle the scenario where the data is identical but in a different order.

The bug occurs because the `equals` method does not take into account the order of the blocks within the DataFrames. It only checks for block equality without considering their location.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `equals` method to first sort the data within each block based on their index and then compare the sorted blocks for equality.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = [block.sort_index() for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks = [block.sort_index() for block in other.blocks]
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected code, we first sort the data within each block using the `sort_index` method. Then we compare the sorted blocks for equality using the `equals` method. This approach ensures that the equality check takes into account the order of the data within the blocks.
