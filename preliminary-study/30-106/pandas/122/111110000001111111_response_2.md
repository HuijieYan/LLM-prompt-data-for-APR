The issue seems to be with the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class, which incorrectly returns `True` when comparing two instances with identical blocks but different locations.

It appears that the bug is caused by the sorting of blocks and comparing them using the `equals` method without taking the locations of the blocks into account.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to modify the `equals` method to first check if the axes are equal, consolidate the blocks, and then compare the blocks by their contents and locations.

Corrected code for the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    # Sort blocks by type and locations
    self_blocks = sorted(
        [(b.get_values(), b.mgr_locs) for b in self.blocks],
        key=lambda x: (str(type(x[0])), x[1].as_array.tolist())
    )
    other_blocks = sorted(
        [(b.get_values(), b.mgr_locs) for b in other.blocks],
        key=lambda x: (str(type(x[0])), x[1].as_array.tolist())
    )
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        (str(type(self_block)) == str(type(other_block)) and self_block[1].as_array.tolist() == other_block[1].as_array.tolist())
        for self_block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the axes are equal. Then, we consolidate the blocks of both instances and sort them by their types and locations. Finally, we compare the sorted blocks by type and location to determine equality. This should address the issue of returning incorrect results when comparing instances with identical blocks but different locations.
