The bug in the provided function is that the logic is not correctly handling the subtraction operations with different data types, particularly when dealing with datetime and timedelta data types. 

The bug occurs because the function is not properly handling the different scenarios when subtracting datetime and timedelta data, resulting in incorrect results and potential errors.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle different data types and perform the subtraction operations based on the data type involved.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    # handle subtraction of datetime and timedelta data types
    if isinstance(other, np.datetime64) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        # subtract timedelta from datetime
        return other - self
    elif is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype) and hasattr(other, "dtype") and not is_datetime64_any_dtype(other.dtype):
        # handle subtracting datetime from non-datetime data types
        raise TypeError("cannot subtract datetime from non-datetime data type")
    elif is_period_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other.dtype):
        # handle subtraction of period and timedelta data types
        raise TypeError("cannot subtract period from timedelta")
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        # handle subtraction of timedelta data types
        return (-self) + other

    return -(self - other)
```

This corrected code properly handles the subtraction of datetime and timedelta data types, raising TypeError for unsupported operations and providing the correct result for the subtraction.
