The potential error in the provided function is its handling of different data types and the operations associated with them. The function seems to be trying to handle different combinations of data types such as datetime64, timedelta, and period, but the logic for handling these combinations is flawed.

The bug occurs because the function is not properly handling all the different data type combinations in a comprehensive manner. As a result, it may lead to incorrect results or type errors.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle each data type combination separately and perform the corresponding operations based on the types involved.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if not isinstance(other, (DatetimeLikeArrayMixin, np.ndarray)):
            from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray
            other = DatetimeArray(other)
        return other - self
    elif is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype) and hasattr(other, "dtype") and not is_datetime64_any_dtype(other.dtype):
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {typ} from {cls}".format(
                typ=type(other).__name__, cls=type(self).__name__
            )
        )
    elif is_period_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other):
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {dtype} from {cls}".format(
                dtype=other.dtype, cls=type(self).__name__
            )
        )
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if lib.is_integer(other) or is_integer_dtype(other):
            return -self._sub_with_instance(other)
        return (-self) + other
    return -self._sub_with_instance(other)
```
