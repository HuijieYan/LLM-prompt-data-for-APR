The buggy function is designed to handle different types of input data, including numpy datetimes and timedeltas. The function appears to be designed to perform datetime arithmetic and handle different types of datetime-like objects.

The potential error seems to be in handling the subtraction of a datetime object from a timedelta object. The code is not handling this case properly, leading to a TypeError being raised.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the subtraction operation between these types of objects.

Below is the corrected code for the function:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        # ndarray[datetime64] cannot be subtracted from self, so
        # we need to wrap in DatetimeArray/Index and flip the operation
        if not isinstance(other, DatetimeLikeArrayMixin):
            # Avoid down-casting DatetimeIndex
            from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray

            other = DatetimeArray(other)
        return other - self
    elif (
        is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype)
        and hasattr(other, "dtype")
        and not is_datetime64_any_dtype(other.dtype)
    ):
        # GH#19959 datetime - datetime is well-defined as timedelta,
        # but any other type - datetime is not well-defined.
        if isinstance(other, Timestamp) or isinstance(other, datetime):
            return self - np.timedelta64(other)
        else:
            raise TypeError(
                "cannot subtract {cls} from {typ}".format(
                    cls=type(self).__name__, typ=type(other).__name__
                )
            )
    elif is_period_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other):
        # TODO: Can we simplify/generalize these cases at all?
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {cls} from {dtype}".format(
                cls=type(self).__name__, dtype=other.dtype
            )
        )
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if lib.is_integer(other) or is_integer_dtype(other):
            # need to subtract before negating, since that flips freq
            # -self flips self.freq, messing up results
            return -(self - other)

        return (-self) + other

    return -(self - other)
```
This corrected code includes additional checks and handling for datetime and timedelta objects to ensure proper subtraction operations can take place without raising a TypeError.
