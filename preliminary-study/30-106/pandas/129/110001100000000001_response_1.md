The potential error in the given function is that the logic for handling different data types and their subtraction operations is not properly implemented, leading to potential errors or incorrect results.

One possible reason for the bug is that the function does not handle all possible combinations of data types and their subtraction operations. This lack of comprehensive coverage leads to potential errors and inconsistencies.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated to properly handle the different data type combinations for subtraction operations. This can be achieved by using conditional statements and type checking to ensure that the correct operation is performed based on the input data types.

Additionally, the corrected code should handle the edge cases and potential error scenarios to provide more robust and reliable behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        # Handle subtraction of datetime64 and timedelta64
        if not isinstance(other, DatetimeLikeArrayMixin):
            from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray
            other = DatetimeArray(other)
        return other - self
    elif is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype) and hasattr(other, "dtype") and not is_datetime64_any_dtype(other.dtype):
        # Raise error for subtraction of non-datetime type from datetime
        raise TypeError("cannot subtract {typ} from {cls}".format(cls=type(self).__name__, typ=type(other).__name__))
    elif is_period_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other):
        # Handle subtraction of period type and timedelta64
        raise TypeError("cannot subtract {dtype} from {cls}".format(cls=type(self).__name__, dtype=other.dtype))
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        # Handle subtraction of timedelta64 and integer or other types
        if lib.is_integer(other) or is_integer_dtype(other):
            # Subtract and negate for integer types
            return -(self - other)
        return (-self) + other
    else:
        # Handle all other cases
        return -(self - other)
```
