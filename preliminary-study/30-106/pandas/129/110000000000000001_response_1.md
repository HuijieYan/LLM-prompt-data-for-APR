Potential error location: 
The potential error location within the problematic function is in the conditional statements and the return statements, where the logic might not be handling all possible cases correctly.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug might be occurring due to incorrect handling of different data types (datetime64, timedelta64, period) and their respective subtraction operations within the function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Review the conditional statements and ensure that they cover all possible cases and data type combinations.
2. Update the logic for handling datetime64, timedelta64, and period data types and their subtraction operations.
3. Make sure to handle any potential type conversion or casting as needed to perform the correct subtraction operation.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        # ndarray[datetime64] cannot be subtracted from self, so
        # we need to wrap in DatetimeArray/Index and flip the operation
        if not isinstance(other, DatetimeLikeArrayMixin):
            # Avoid down-casting DatetimeIndex
            from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray

            other = DatetimeArray(other)
        return other - self
    elif is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other.dtype):
        # GH#19959 datetime - datetime is well-defined as timedelta,
        # But any other type - datetime is not well-defined.
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {cls} from {typ}".format(
                cls=type(self).__name__, typ=type(other).__name__
            )
        )
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other.dtype):
        return -(self - other)
    else:
        return -(self - other)
```
