The buggy function appears to be trying to implement subtraction for a custom data type that represents arrays of timedelta-like objects. The error message in the buggy function indicates that it is trying to deal with various data types and perform subtraction based on these data types.

The bug is occurring due to the mishandling of different data types and the incorrect implementation of subtraction and type checking. 

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the different types of data being passed and performs the appropriate subtraction based on the data types. We also need to make sure that type checking is done correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    import pandas as pd
    
    if pd.api.types.is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and pd.api.types.is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if not isinstance(other, pd.DatetimeIndex):
            other = pd.DatetimeIndex(other)
        return other - self
    elif pd.api.types.is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype) and hasattr(other, "dtype") and not pd.api.types.is_datetime64_any_dtype(other.dtype):
        raise TypeError("cannot subtract {cls} from {typ}".format(cls=type(self).__name__, typ=type(other).__name__))
    elif pd.api.types.is_period_dtype(self.dtype) and pd.api.types.is_timedelta64_dtype(other):
        raise TypeError("cannot subtract {cls} from {dtype}".format(cls=type(self).__name__, dtype=other.dtype))
    elif pd.api.types.is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype(other):
            return -(self - other)
        return (-self) + other

    return -(self - other)
```

This corrected code checks the types of the parameters being passed and then performs the appropriate subtraction based on the data types. It also uses the correct Pandas API methods for type checking.
