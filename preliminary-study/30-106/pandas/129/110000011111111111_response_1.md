The error occurs in the `__rsub__` method of the TimedeltaArray class. The error message indicates that the `DatetimeArray` expects an ndarray, a Series, or an Index containing one of those, but it's receiving a `datetime64` type instead.

The potential error location is the line with `other = DatetimeArray(other)` inside the `__rsub__` method.

The bug occurs because the `DatetimeArray` class expects specific types (`ndarray`, `Series`, or `Index`), but it's getting a `datetime64` type instead. It should be expecting `datetime64` as well.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `__rsub__` method to handle `datetime64` type as an input value for the `other` parameter and create a `DatetimeArray` object accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray

        if not isinstance(other, (np.ndarray, pd.Series, pd.Index)):
            other = pd.Index([other])
        other = DatetimeArray(other)

        return other - self
    # Handle other cases as before
    # ...
```

This modification will ensure that the `DatetimeArray` can handle `datetime64` type as one of the input options for the `other` parameter.
