Potential error location: The potential error is in the `__rsub__` method, which is used for the right-hand side subtraction operation.

Reason for the bug: The bug is likely occurring due to the incorrect handling of different data types and the operations between them. The code does not handle all possible cases of subtraction involving datetime, timedelta, and other data types properly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Handle the cases involving different data types (datetime, timedelta, etc.) in a more comprehensive manner.
2. Check for the data types and handle the operations accordingly to avoid any type errors or unexpected behavior.
3. Consider using built-in functionality for datetime and timedelta operations whenever possible.

Here's the corrected code for the `__rsub__` method:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other):
        return self - other
    elif is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype) and is_datetime64_any_dtype(other):
        # Handle datetime - datetime as timedelta
        return self.astype('int64') - other.astype('int64')
    else:
        # Handle other cases
        return NotImplemented
```
