The buggy function __rsub__ is designed to handle operations involving different types of datetime objects and arrays. However, the function contains logical errors, leading to potential incorrect results and potential runtime issues. 

A potential approach to fix the bug is to revise the conditional logic within the function to properly handle the different combinations of input types and their respective operations. Additionally, special consideration should be given to the data types and their compatibility, as well as the behavior of the datetime and timedelta objects during subtraction.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray
    from pandas.core.tools.timedeltas import to_timedelta

    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other):
        return DatetimeArray(other) - self

    if isinstance(other, (datetime.datetime, np.datetime64, pd.Timestamp)):
        other = to_timedelta(other)

    if is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other.dtype):
        return to_timedelta(self) - to_timedelta(other)

    # Handle other cases or raise any specific errors if needed

    return NotImplemented
```

In the corrected function, the logic has been revised to properly handle conversions between different datetime objects and timedelta arrays. The use of `DatetimeArray` and `to_timedelta` functions ensures that the appropriate transformations are applied before performing the subtraction operation, leading to more accurate and consistent results.
