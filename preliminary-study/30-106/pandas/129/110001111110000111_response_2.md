The error occurs in the `__rsub__` method in the `pandas.core.arrays.datetimelike.py` file. This method is supposed to handle the subtraction operation when the left-hand operand is not a timedelta object. The error message indicates that the issue is related to creating a `DatetimeArray` from the `other` variable.

The bug is caused by the incorrect use of the `DatetimeArray()` constructor. It's likely that the `other` variable is not an appropriate input for creating a `DatetimeArray` object, resulting in the ValueError.

To fix this bug, we should modify the logic in the `__rsub__` method to correctly handle the subtraction operation based on the type of the `self` and `other` variables. It's also important to ensure that the creation of a `DatetimeArray` is done with appropriate input.

Below is the corrected code for the `__rsub__` method:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        # ndarray[datetime64] cannot be subtracted from self, so
        # we need to wrap in DatetimeArray/Index and flip the operation
        if not isinstance(other, DatetimeLikeArrayMixin):
            # Avoid down-casting DatetimeIndex
            from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray

            other = DatetimeArray(other, dtype=self.dtype)
        return other - self
    elif (
        is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype)
        and hasattr(other, "dtype")
        and not is_datetime64_any_dtype(other.dtype)
    ):
        # GH#19959 datetime - datetime is well-defined as timedelta,
        # but any other type - datetime is not well-defined.
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {cls} from {typ}".format(
                cls=type(self).__name__, typ=type(other).__name__
            )
        )
    elif is_period_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other):
        # TODO: Can we simplify/generalize these cases at all?
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {cls} from {dtype}".format(
                cls=type(self).__name__, dtype=other.dtype
            )
        )
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if lib.is_integer(other) or is_integer_dtype(other):
            # need to subtract before negating, since that flips freq
            # -self flips self.freq, messing up results
            return -(self - other)

        return (-self) + other

    return -(self - other)
```

By modifying the `DatetimeArray` creation and handling the subtraction logic appropriately, the bug should be fixed.
