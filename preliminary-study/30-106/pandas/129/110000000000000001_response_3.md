The potential error in the code is with the logic for subtraction and handling different data types. It appears that the function is not correctly handling subtraction between different data types, particularly datetime and timedelta.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle the different data types correctly in the subtraction operation. This results in a TypeError being raised when trying to subtract one data type from another.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the different data type combinations and performs the subtraction operation accordingly, without raising any errors.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray
        # Wrap other in DatetimeArray/Index and flip the operation
        other = DatetimeArray(other)
        return other - self
    elif is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype) and hasattr(other, "dtype") and not is_datetime64_any_dtype(other.dtype):
        raise TypeError("cannot subtract {typ} from {cls}".format(typ=type(self).__name__, cls=type(other).__name__))
    elif is_period_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other):
        raise TypeError("cannot subtract {dtype} from {cls}".format(dtype=other.dtype, cls=type(self).__name__))
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if lib.is_integer(other) or is_integer_dtype(other):
            return -(self + other)  # Corrected to use addition instead of subtraction, since self is already negated
        return (-self) + other
    return -(self + other)  # Corrected to use addition instead of subtraction
```
