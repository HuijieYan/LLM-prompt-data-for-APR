Potential error location: 
The bug is likely occurring due to comparisons between different types of datetime values and their calculations.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: 
The bug occurs because the current handling of datetime values and their calculations in the function is incorrect. It is not properly handling the different datetime objects and their calculations.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that the function appropriately handles the different datetime objects and their calculations, taking into account the types and their respective operations.

Corrected code:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
        if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
            if isinstance(other, Timestamp):
                from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray
                other = DatetimeArray([other])
                return other - self
            elif isinstance(other, np.datetime64):
                from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray
                other = DatetimeArray([other])
                return other - self

        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {cls} from {typ}".format(
                cls=type(self).__name__, typ=type(other).__name__
            )
        )
```
