The error seems to be occurring in the `__rsub__` method of the `DatetimeLikeArrayMixin` class. This is likely due to the creation of a `DatetimeArray` from the `other` parameter without proper validation and type checking.

The bug occurs because the `DatetimeArray` is created without validation of the input data type. As per the error message, the received type is `datetime64`, which does not match the expected type. This leads to a `ValueError` being raised with the message "Unexpected type 'datetime64'. 'values' must be a DatetimeArray ndarray, or Series or Index containing one of those."

To fix this bug, proper validation and type checking are required to ensure that the input `other` is a valid datetime type. Then, it should be validated whether the `DatetimeArray` creation from `other` is necessary. 

Here's the corrected code for the `__rsub__` method:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        # ndarray[datetime64] cannot be subtracted from self,
        # so we need to wrap in DatetimeArray/Index and flip the operation
        if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other):
            if not isinstance(other, DatetimeLikeArrayMixin):
                # Avoid down-casting DatetimeIndex
                from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray

                if isinstance(other, np.ndarray):
                    other = DatetimeArray(other, dtype=other.dtype)
                else:
                    raise ValueError("'other' must be a DatetimeArray ndarray or an Index containing one.")
            
            return -(other - self)
        elif hasattr(other, "dtype") and is_datetime64_any_dtype(other.dtype):
            # GH#19959 datetime - datetime is well-defined as timedelta,
            # but any other type - datetime is not well-defined.
            raise TypeError(
                "cannot subtract {cls} from {typ}".format(
                    cls=type(self).__name__, typ=type(other).__name__
                )
            )
    
    # Existing code here
```

In the corrected code, we perform type validation and create a `DatetimeArray` only if the type of `other` matches the expected types. Otherwise, appropriate error handling is added to handle the mismatched type inputs.
