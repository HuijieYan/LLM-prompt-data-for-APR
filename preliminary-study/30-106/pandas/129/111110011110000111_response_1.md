The error occurs in the `__rsub__` method of the class `DatetimeLikeArrayMixin`.

The reason behind the bug is that the `__rsub__` method is calling `DatetimeArray(other)` in some cases, but the `values` provided to the `DatetimeArray` constructor is not compatible, leading to a `ValueError`.

To fix this bug, this method needs to be adjusted to handle the different types of input `other` can take.

Here's the corrected code for the `__rsub__` method:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray
        
        if not isinstance(other, DatetimeLikeArrayMixin):
            other = DatetimeArray(other)
        return other - self

    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype) and isinstance(other, (int, float, np.integer, np.floating)):
        return -(self - other)

    return NotImplemented
```

In this corrected version, the method now directly handles specific cases for different types of operations and input `other`. If the input `other` is not of a supported type, the method returns `NotImplemented`.
