Potential error location: The potential error in the code is the use of the `__rsub__` method to handle subtraction. This method is used to implement the behavior of the right-hand operand when a datetime-like object is subtracted from it.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug may be occurring due to incorrect handling of different datatypes and their subtraction operations. The if-else conditions may not be properly structured to handle different cases, leading to unexpected behavior.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the datatype of `self` and `other` before performing subtraction operations to ensure compatibility.
2. Use appropriate methods and classes to handle datetime-like arrays and indexes.
3. Restructure the if-else conditions to handle different cases more effectively.

Corrected code:
```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray, Timedelta

    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        # ndarray[datetime64] cannot be subtracted from self, so
        # we need to wrap in DatetimeArray/Index and flip the operation
        if not isinstance(other, DatetimeLikeArrayMixin):
            other = DatetimeArray(other)
        return other - self
    elif (
        is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype)
        and hasattr(other, "dtype")
        and not is_datetime64_any_dtype(other.dtype)
    ):
        # GH#19959 datetime - datetime is well-defined as timedelta,
        # but any other type - datetime is not well-defined.
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {cls} from {typ}".format(
                cls=type(self).__name__, typ=type(other).__name__
            )
        )
    elif is_period_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other):
        # TODO: Can we simplify/generalize these cases at all?
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {cls} from {dtype}".format(
                cls=type(self).__name__, dtype=other.dtype
            )
        )
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if isinstance(other, (int, float)):
            # need to subtract before negating, since that flips freq
            # -self flips self.freq, messing up results
            return -(self - Timedelta(days=other))

        return (-self) + other

    return -(self - other)
```
