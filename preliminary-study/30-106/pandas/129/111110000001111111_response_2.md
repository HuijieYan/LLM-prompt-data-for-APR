Based on the buggy function provided, the __rsub__ method is intended to handle cases where a datetime or timedelta is subtracted from a TimedeltaArray. However, the implementation appears to contain errors.
The issues with the function seem to be related to handling the different data types and performing the subtraction operation.

To fix the bug:
1. Check the data types of the 'self' and 'other' parameters to ensure that the appropriate operations are performed.
2. Correctly handle the scenarios where a Timestamp or datetime is subtracted from the TimedeltaArray by performing the necessary operations based on the data types.

Here is the corrected code for the __rsub__ method:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        # Subtract the TimedeltaArray from the Timestamp or datetime
        return np.array(other) - self._data
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other):
        # Subtract one TimedeltaArray from another
        return self._data - other._data
    else:
        # Raise a TypeError for unsupported operations
        raise TypeError(
            "unsupported operand type(s) for -: '{}' and '{}'".format(
                type(self).__name__, type(other).__name__
            )
        )
```
