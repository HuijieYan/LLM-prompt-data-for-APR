Potential error location: The bug seems to be occurring in the logic for handling the subtraction operations in the __rsub__ method. 

Reasons behind the bug: 
1. The logic for handling different data types and operations is convoluted and not well-structured.
2. The handling of the "other" argument is inconsistent and can lead to unexpected behavior.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Refactor the logic to use separate if-elif blocks for each data type and operation to handle them separately and clearly.
2. Utilize built-in functions and methods for handling datetime and timedelta objects, rather than attempting custom operations.

Corrected code:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if not isinstance(other, DatetimeLikeArrayMixin):
            from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray
            other = DatetimeArray(other)
        return other - self

    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype) and hasattr(other, "dtype") and not is_datetime64_any_dtype(other.dtype):
        raise TypeError("cannot subtract {cls} from {typ}".format(cls=type(self).__name__, typ=type(other).__name__))

    if is_period_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other):
        raise TypeError("cannot subtract {cls} from {dtype}".format(cls=type(self).__name__, dtype=other.dtype))

    if is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if lib.is_integer(other) or is_integer_dtype(other):
            return -(self + other)  # corrected the negation and addition operation

        return (-self) + other

    return -(self + other)  # corrected the negation and addition operation
```
