The error is occurring in the `__rsub__` method of the `DatetimeLikeArrayMixin` class. The error message indicates that the function is trying to create a `DatetimeArray` from `other`, which has a type of `datetime64`. This is not valid because `other` should be a DatetimeArray ndarray, or Series or Index containing one of those.

The reason for the bug is that the function should only create a `DatetimeArray` from `other` if `other` is not already an instance of `DatetimeLikeArrayMixin`. Additionally, the creation of a `DatetimeArray` from `other` should only occur in specific cases when the input `other` is expected to be a valid input for the `DatetimeArray` constructor.

To fix the bug, you need to modify the `__rsub__` method to handle the `other` input properly and only create a `DatetimeArray` from `other` in the specific cases where it is needed.

Here's the corrected `__rsub__` method:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        # ndarray[datetime64] cannot be subtracted from self, so
        # we need to wrap in DatetimeArray/Index and flip the operation
        if not isinstance(other, DatetimeArray):
            # Avoid down-casting DatetimeIndex
            from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray

            if isinstance(other, np.ndarray):
                return DatetimeArray(other) - self
            else:
                raise TypeError("Unexpected type '{}'. 'other' must be a DatetimeArray ndarray, or Series or Index containing one of those.")
        return other - self
    elif (
        is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype)
        and hasattr(other, "dtype")
        and not is_datetime64_any_dtype(other.dtype)
    ):
        # GH#19959 datetime - datetime is well-defined as timedelta,
        # but any other type - datetime is not well-defined.
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {cls} from {typ}".format(
                cls=type(self).__name__, typ=type(other).__name__
            )
        )
    # ... other cases ...
```

In this corrected code, the function checks if `other` is already an instance of `DatetimeArray` and handles it accordingly. Additionally, it includes a type check and a specific error message to be raised when `other` is not a valid input for the `DatetimeArray` constructor.
