The error occurs in the `__rsub__` method of the `DatetimeLikeArrayMixin` class. The error message indicates that the function is trying to initialize a `DatetimeArray` with an unexpected type 'datetime64'. This occurs because the method incorrectly assumes that `other` should be converted to a `DatetimeArray` in the case where `other` is a `Timestamp` or `datetime`. However, in some cases, `other` might already be of type `datetime64`.

To fix the bug, different approaches are possible:
1. Check the type of `other` before attempting to convert it to a `DatetimeArray`.
2. Modify the conditions and type checks within the function to ensure that the correct type conversions are performed based on the type of `other`.
3. Handle the different input types (Timestamp, datetime, datetime64) separately within the function to avoid unexpected type errors.

Below is the corrected code for the `__rsub__` method:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if not isinstance(other, DatetimeLikeArrayMixin):
            from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray
            other = DatetimeArray(other)
        return other - self
    elif is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype) and hasattr(other, "dtype") and not is_datetime64_any_dtype(other.dtype):
        raise TypeError("cannot subtract {cls} from {typ}".format(cls=type(self).__name__, typ=type(other).__name__))
    elif is_period_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other):
        raise TypeError("cannot subtract {cls} from {dtype}".format(cls=type(self).__name__, dtype=other.dtype))
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if lib.is_integer(other) or is_integer_dtype(other):
            return -(self - other)
        return (-self) + other
    return -(self - other)
```

The corrected code includes checks for the specific cases where `other` is a `Timestamp`, `datetime`, or `datetime64`, and handles the conversions and operations accordingly. This should prevent the unexpected type errors that were occurring in the original buggy code.
