The buggy function is intended to handle subtraction operations involving different data types (datetime and timedelta) in pandas. However, there are several issues with the existing code that could result in errors.

1. The function checks the types and properties of the input parameters, such as `self` and `other` variables, to determine how to perform the subtraction operation. 
2. The bug occurs due to inconsistent handling of different data type combinations, leading to unexpected behavior and potential errors.

To fix the function, the code should be rewritten to handle each data type combination correctly and consistently. Here's the corrected function:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    import numpy as np
    from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray
    
    if self.dtype == np.dtype('<m8[ns]') and isinstance(other, np.datetime64):
        # Wrap other in DatetimeArray/Index and flip the operation
        other = DatetimeArray([other])  # Wrap in DatetimeArray
        return other - self
    elif (self.dtype == np.dtype('<m8[ns]') and isinstance(other, (pd.DatetimeIndex, pd.DatetimeArray))):
        return -(-self - other)  # Subtracting datetime objects returns timedelta
    elif (self.dtype == np.dtype('<m8[ns]') and isinstance(other, np.timedelta64)):
        return -(-self - other)  # Subtracting timedelta returns timedelta
    else:
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {cls} from {typ}".format(
                cls=type(self).__name__, typ=type(other).__name__
            )
        )
```

This corrected function ensures that the subtraction operation is handled consistently and appropriately based on the data type of the inputs.
