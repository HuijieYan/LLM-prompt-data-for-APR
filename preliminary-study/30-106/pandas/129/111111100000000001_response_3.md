Potential error location: The buggy function `__rsub__` is trying to handle different types of operands for subtraction, but the implementation is incorrect in handling some of the cases.

Reasons behind the bug:
1. The function is trying to handle different data types and operations, such as subtracting datetime from timedelta, subtracting period from timedelta, and subtracting timedelta from an integer.
2. The logic for handling these different cases is incorrect, leading to potential errors or unexpected behavior.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Revisit the logic for handling different data types and operations to ensure that the correct behavior is implemented for each case.
2. Check for edge cases and handle them explicitly to avoid unexpected errors.
3. Use appropriate type checking and conversions to ensure that the operations are well-defined for the given data types.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, DatetimeLikeArrayMixin):
        # Handle subtraction of datetime from timedelta
        return other._generate_range(subtract=self)
    else:
        # For other cases, raise a TypeError
        raise TypeError("Unsupported operation: cannot subtract {typ} from {cls}".format(
            typ=type(other).__name__, cls=type(self).__name__))
```
In this corrected code, we handle the case where `other` is an instance of `DatetimeLikeArrayMixin` and call the `_generate_range` method on `other` with the `subtract` parameter set to `self`. This reflects the intended behavior of the `__rsub__` method, which is to handle the subtraction operation when the left operand does not support the operation directly.

For all other cases, we raise a TypeError to indicate that the operation is not supported for the given types. This simplifies the logic and makes the code easier to understand and maintain.
