The buggy code is a Python method from the Pandas library, specifically from the `DatetimeLikeArrayMixin` class. This method is used to handle the subtraction operation when the first operand does not support the `-` operator. 

The potential error occurs when there is a mismatch between the data types on which the subtraction is being performed. The error message will be raised when the `other` operand is not of type `datetime64` and the `self` operand is of type `timedelta64`.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `__rsub__` method to check the type of `other` and act accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, (Timestamp, datetime.datetime, np.datetime64)) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray
        other = DatetimeArray(other)
        return other - self
    elif not is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        # throw an error if self is not of type timedelta64
        raise TypeError("unsupported operation")
    return -(self - other)
```
In the corrected code, we check for the type of `other` and if it matches with the supported types (`Timestamp`, `datetime.datetime`, and `np.datetime64`), we wrap it into a `DatetimeArray` and perform the subtraction. If the type of `self` is not `timedelta64`, we raise a `TypeError`. Finally, in the else block, we perform the subtraction and negate the result.
