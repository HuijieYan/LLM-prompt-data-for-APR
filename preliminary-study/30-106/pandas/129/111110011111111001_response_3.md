The error occurs in the `__rsub__` method of the `DatetimeLikeArrayMixin` class. This method deals with the subtraction operator when the object is on the right-hand side. The error message indicates that there is a ValueError because the 'values' must be a DatetimeArray ndarray, or a Series or Index containing one of those, but it received an unexpected type 'datetime64'.

The reason behind this bug is that the `__rsub__` method tries to instantiate a DatetimeArray object with the `other` parameter, assuming that it's a compatible type. However, this assumption fails and leads to a ValueError.

To solve this bug, the `__rsub__` method needs to handle the different data types of the `other` parameter more flexibly and appropriately, considering the specific cases where it fails and adjusting the behavior accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray

        if not isinstance(other, DatetimeArray):
            other_values = np.array([other], dtype='datetime64[ns]')
            other = DatetimeArray(other_values)
        return other - self
    elif is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype) and isinstance(other, (DatetimeArray, np.datetime64)):
        if hasattr(other, "dtype") and not is_datetime64_any_dtype(other.dtype):
            raise TypeError(
                "cannot subtract {cls} from {typ}".format(
                    cls=type(self).__name__, typ=type(other).__name__
                )
            )
        else:
            return other - self
    elif is_period_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other.dtype):
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {cls} from {dtype}".format(
                cls=type(self).__name__, dtype=other.dtype
            )
        )
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if lib.is_scalar(other) or is_scalar(other):
            return -(self - other)
        return (-self) + other

    return -(self - other)
```

In the corrected code, the conditions have been modified to handle different types appropriately, and specifically for the case where `other` is of the `datetime64` type. This should resolve the ValueError and ensure the correct behavior of the subtraction operation.
