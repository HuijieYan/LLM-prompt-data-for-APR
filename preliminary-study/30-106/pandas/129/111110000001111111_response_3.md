The buggy function is __rsub__, used for the computation of the right-hand subtraction operation. The function is meant to handle cases where a timedelta array is subtracted from a datetime or timedelta, but it contains multiple issues, resulting in potential errors.

The main issues in the function are as follows:
1. The function lacks proper handling for the input parameters and their types in various cases, resulting in a type mismatch.
2. The logic for handling different types of input parameters is not clearly defined, leading to potential inconsistencies and errors.
3. The function does not account for the different types of input parameters and their interactions, resulting in unexpected behavior and errors.

To fix the function, the following approaches can be taken:
1. Implement conditional branches to handle each type of input parameter separately, ensuring that the operations are performed correctly for each case.
2. Use type checking and conversion if necessary to ensure that the input parameters are of compatible types for subtraction operations.
3. Ensure that the function returns the correct type of output based on the input types and operations performed.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if isinstance(self, DatetimeLikeArrayMixin):
        # Ensure that other is of compatible types for subtraction
        if isinstance(other, pd.Timestamp) and pd.api.types.is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
            return other - self
        elif isinstance(other, (datetime.datetime, np.datetime64)) and pd.api.types.is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
            return np.datetime64(other) - self
        elif pd.api.types.is_timedelta64_dtype(other.dtype) and pd.api.types.is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
            return other - self
        else:
            raise TypeError("Unsupported types for subtraction")
    else:
        raise TypeError("Unsupported operation for the input type")
```
