The buggy function is trying to perform subtraction between a datetime and a timedelta. The bug seems to occur when the function encounters a mismatch in types, specifically between datetime and timedelta. The function then fails to handle this scenario and raises a TypeError.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to handle the subtraction operation between timedelta and datetime properly. We can do this by extracting the numerical value from the timedelta, performing the subtraction with the datetime, and returning the result as a new datetime.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if isinstance(other, (pd.Timestamp, np.datetime64)):
            # Extract numerical value from the timedelta
            value = self[0]
            
            # Perform subtraction with the datetime
            new_datetime = other - pd.Timedelta(value)
            return new_datetime
        else:
            raise TypeError(
                "cannot subtract {cls} from {typ}".format(
                    cls=type(self).__name__, typ=type(other).__name__
                )
            )
    # Add more cases for other types or dtypes as required
    
    return -(self - other)
```

In this corrected code, we handle the case where the `other` is a timestamp or numpy datetime64 by extracting the numerical value from the `self` timedelta array. We then perform the subtraction with the `other` value and return the result as a new datetime object.
