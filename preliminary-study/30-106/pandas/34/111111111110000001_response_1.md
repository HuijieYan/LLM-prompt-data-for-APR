The error message indicates an issue with inferring daylight saving time for a specific date and time. This error occurs when the date and time provided do not allow for the inference of whether daylight saving time is in effect.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the calculation of bin edges and labels. The function `_get_time_bins` is responsible for calculating these bin edges and labels for time intervals using the provided date index. The error could be related to the incorrect handling of daylight saving time transitions.

The bug occurs because the function does not adequately handle the occurrence of ambiguous times, such as the transition between standard time and daylight saving time.

To fix the bug, the corrected code must handle the ambiguous time error that occurs during the calculation of bin edges and labels.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )
    
    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels
    
    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # Use normalize=True to avoid issues with daylight saving time transitions
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
        normalize=True  # Add this argument to handle daylight saving time transitions
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )
    
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]
    
    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
    
    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]
    
    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code, the `normalize=True` argument is added to the `date_range` function call to handle daylight saving time transitions and avoid the ambiguous time error. This change ensures that the bin edges and labels are generated correctly, accounting for potential issues with daylight saving time.
