The error is occurring because on November 4th, there is a change in time that leads to an ambiguous timestamp. This is causing the groupby function to raise an AmbiguousTimeError.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the calculation of the `binner` and `labels` for the date range. The `DateOffset` is not being handled correctly for the time change, leading to the ambiguous timestamp issue.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle the ambiguous timestamp caused by the time change on November 4th in Cuba. This results in the AmbiguousTimeError when trying to apply the groupby function.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle the ambiguous timestamp caused by the time change on November 4th. This can be done by explicitly specifying the ambiguous and nonexistent parameters when creating the date range. Additionally, the time zone processing needs to be handled properly.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
from pandas import DatetimeIndex, Timestamp, NaT
from pandas.tseries.frequencies import to_offset
from pandas.tseries.frequencies import Day
import pandas._libs.tslibs.timedeltas as lib

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max()
    freq = to_offset(self.freq)
    bins = []
    labels = []
    
    current = first
    while current <= last:
        bins.append(current.value)
        labels.append(current)
        current += freq

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax.asi8, bins, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if ax.hasnans:
        bins = [NaT] + bins
        labels = [NaT] + labels

    return labels, bins, labels
```
