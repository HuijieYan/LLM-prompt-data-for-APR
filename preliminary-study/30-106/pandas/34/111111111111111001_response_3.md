The error occurs in the function `_get_time_bins` inside the class `TimeGrouper` in the file `pandas/core/resample.py`. The error is due to a mismatch between the time bins and labels, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError` during the test.

The potential error location is identified as the calculation and adjustment of the time bins and labels in the `_get_time_bins` function. The error is likely due to an incorrect manipulation of time zones or a misalignment of the time intervals.

To fix the bug, the following approaches could be employed:
1. Ensure that the time bins and labels are properly aligned and adjusted based on the specific time zone-handling requirements.
2. Check for potential edge cases or boundary conditions when calculating the time bins and labels to handle various scenarios, including daylight saving time transitions.
3. Verify that the frequency and offset settings are compatible with the specified time range and interval.

Below is the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    base_time_zone = ax.tz
    start = ax.min().tz_localize(None)  # Remove time zone for start
    end = ax.max().tz_localize(None)  # Remove time zone for end
    bin_edges = date_range(start=start, end=end, freq=self.freq, closed=self.closed, tz=base_time_zone)
    
    binner = labels = date_range(start=start, end=end, freq=self.freq, closed=self.closed, tz=base_time_zone)
    
    bin_edges_as_int64 = bin_edges.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, bin_edges_as_int64)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax.asi8, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
In the corrected code, the adjustment of time bins and labels is handled with proper timezone localization while ensuring that the time intervals are synchronized and adjusted accordingly.
