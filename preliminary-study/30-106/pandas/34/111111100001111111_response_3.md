Issue:
The bug occurs when using the groupby function with a daily frequency on a day with a clock change in Cuba, resulting in an AmbiguousTimeError.

Error Location:
The issue lies in the _get_time_bins method of the TimeGrouper class. Specifically, the problematic part of the code is related to handling ambiguous timestamps and adjusting bin edges for daily frequency.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug is caused by the method's inability to handle ambiguous timestamps, especially when a clock change occurs. This results in an AmbiguousTimeError when grouping with a daily frequency.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. To fix the bug, the code needs to account for ambiguous timestamps, particularly during days with clock changes.
2. Use appropriate timezone handling to address and resolve ambiguous timestamps.
3. Adjust the bin edges to ensure correct grouping and labeling for each day, considering the impact of ambiguous timestamps.

Corrected Code for the Problematic Function:
```python
import warnings

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min() + self.freq
    last = ax.max()

    if first == last:
        first -= self.freq

    bin_edges = date_range(start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name, closed=self.closed, ambiguous='infer')

    bins = ax.searchsorted(bin_edges, side=self.closed)

    if self.closed == 'right':
        labels = bin_edges
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    else:
        if self.label == "right":
            bin_edges = bin_edges[1:]
        labels = bin_edges

    binner = labels
    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
In the corrected code, adjustments have been made to handle ambiguous timestamps and ensure the correct bin edges are used for grouping. Additionally, handling of the 'closed' parameter and appropriate adjustments for labels have been implemented to ensure accurate grouping with daily frequency.
