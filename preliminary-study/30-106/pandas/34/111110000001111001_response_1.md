The potential error location within the problematic function is the "binner, labels = date_range()" line. This line uses the "date_range()" function to set both the "binner" and "labels" variables to the same value. However, in the subsequent code, "labels" is modified based on the value of "self.label" which is unnecessary since both "binner" and "labels" are set to the same value initially.

The buggy behavior occurs because the "labels" variable is incorrectly sliced based on the "self.label" condition after being set to the same value as "binner".

To fix this, we can assign the result of "date_range()" directly to the "binner" variable and then modify "labels" based on the conditions, eliminating the unnecessary duplication of values.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]
    else:
        labels = binner

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
This corrected code eliminates duplicated values and properly modifies the "labels" variable based on the given conditions. This ensures the correct behavior of the function.
