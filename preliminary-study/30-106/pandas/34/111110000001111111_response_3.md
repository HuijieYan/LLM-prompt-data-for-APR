The error message suggests that the issue occurs on a long clock-change day in Cuba, where midnight local time is an ambiguous timestamp. This is likely due to the incorrect handling of time bins and labels for the groupby operation.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the calculation of `first` and `last` in the `_get_time_bins` method, as these are used for creating bins and labels for the groupby operation. When the clock changes on a specific day, it can lead to ambiguous time errors.

To fix the bug, the handling of ambiguous time during the calculation of `first` and `last` needs to be adjusted. One possible approach is to explicitly specify the handling of ambiguous times when creating the bins and labels.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` method:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    # ... existing implementation ...

    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max()

    if self.freq.n == 1:  # Handling daily frequency
        first = first.floor('D')
        last = last.floor('D') + pd.Timedelta(days=1) - pd.Timedelta('ns')
    
    binner = labels = pd.date_range(start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, closed=self.closed, name=ax.name, ambiguous='NaT', nonexistent='shift_forward')

    # ... remaining implementation ...
  
    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the updated code:
1. The `first` and `last` values are calculated by flooring the timestamps to the start of the day and adding necessary adjustments for daily frequency.
2. When creating `binner` and `labels`, the `ambiguous` parameter is explicitly set to 'NaT' to handle ambiguous times.

This approach aims to address the ambiguous time issue specifically related to the daily frequency, particularly on the day when the clock changes.
