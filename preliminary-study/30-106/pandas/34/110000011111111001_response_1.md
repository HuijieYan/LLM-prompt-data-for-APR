The test case `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` includes a step where a DataFrame is created and then downsampled using the `groupby` method along with `pd.Grouper(freq="1D").mean()`. The error message indicates that an `AmbiguousTimeError` occurred, specifically mentioning the inability to infer DST time from a particular timestamp where there are no repeated times.

The potential error location within the `_get_time_bins` function could be the incorrect handling of Daylight Saving Time (DST) transitions for specific timestamps, leading to the ambiguous time error. This error likely arises due to discrepancies in the generated time bins during the resampling process, especially when dealing with timestamps within the overlap of transitioning from standard time to daylight saving time or vice versa.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that proper handling of DST transitions is implemented when generating time bins and labels. This can involve adjustments to how the bins are calculated, considering the potential presence of ambiguous or non-existent times during DST transitions.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` method:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    # Existing code remains unchanged until this point

    # ... (existing code)

    start = ax.min()
    end = ax.max()

    # Use a different approach to generate time bins with the knowledge of potential DST transitions
    bin_edges = date_range(
        start=start,
        end=end,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        closed=self.closed,
        ambiguous='infer',  # Infer ambiguous times
        nonexistent='shift_forward'  # Shift nonexistent times forward
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(bin_edges, ax_values)

    # ... (rest of the existing code)

    # Return the updated binner, bins, and labels
    return binner, bin_edges, bin_edges
```

In the corrected code, the date range generation is modified to explicitly handle ambiguous and nonexistent times during DST transitions, mitigating the potential for the AmbiguousTimeError. Additionally, the adjusted `bin_edges` are utilized for further processing, ensuring that DST transitions are properly accounted for during resampling operations.
