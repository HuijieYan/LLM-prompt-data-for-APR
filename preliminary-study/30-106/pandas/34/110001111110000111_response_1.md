The error message indicates that there is an issue with handling ambiguous time during the groupby operation in the `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` test case. This is related to the `AmbiguousTimeError` related to handling of ambiguous time in the code.

After analyzing the code, the potential error location within the problematic function is likely the `_get_time_bins` function. This function is responsible for generating time bins, and the error may be related to how it handles ambiguous time during the groupby operation.

The bug occurs because the `_get_time_bins` function doesn't handle ambiguous times properly when generating time bins. When the time is ambiguous, it leads to an `AmbiguousTimeError` during the groupby operation, as seen in the test case.

To fix the bug, the `_get_time_bins` function needs to handle ambiguous times correctly, ensuring that the time bins are generated without causing an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

Below is the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",  # Handle ambiguous time
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # rest of the code remains unchanged
    ...
    ...
    ...

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code, the `ambiguous` argument in the `date_range` function is set to "infer" to handle ambiguous time, ensuring that time bins are generated without causing an `AmbiguousTimeError`. This fix should address the issue described in the test case and the associated GitHub issue.
