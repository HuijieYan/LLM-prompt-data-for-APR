The error message indicates that the code is encountering an 'AmbiguousTimeError' related to DST transitions.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely stemming from the date range generation and handling during the DST transition.

The error is occurring due to incorrect handling of ambiguous times during the Daylight Saving Time (DST) transition period. The `tz_localize_to_utc` method attempts to infer the DST time, but there are no repeated times, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError.

To fix the bug, it's important to handle the ambiguous times during the DST transition. One possible approach is to use the `ambiguous` parameter in the `date_range` method to specify how to handle ambiguous times. Additionally, the `nonexistent` parameter can be used to handle non-existent times during the DST transition.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function, focusing on handling ambiguous and non-existent times during the DST transition:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    # Existing code

    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous='NaT',  # Handle ambiguous times by inserting NaT
        nonexistent='shift_forward'  # Move non-existent times ahead during DST transition
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Existing code

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Adjust the labels if we end up with more labels than bins
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With these modifications, the corrected function should handle ambiguous and non-existent times appropriately during the DST transition.
