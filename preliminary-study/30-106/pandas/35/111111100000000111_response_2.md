Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the `_engine` function, where a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is being passed to `_engine_type`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object is being dropped before it is intended to be, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: One possible approach to fix the bug is to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is maintained until it is intended to be dropped. This could involve modifying the way weak references are handled in the `_engine` function.

```python
# corrected _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine
```

In the corrected code, the `weakref.ref` is used to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object, and this weak reference is then passed to the `_engine_type` function. The resulting engine is then returned from the function. This approach ensures that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is maintained until it is intended to be dropped.
