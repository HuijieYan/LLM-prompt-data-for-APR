The issue occurs because the weakref to the `PeriodIndex` instance is being dropped prematurely. When the `_engine_type` method is called, it receives a None instead of the actual `PeriodIndex` instance, causing the error.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weakref to the `PeriodIndex` instance remains valid until it is no longer needed. This can be achieved by modifying the `_engine` method to store the weakref as an attribute of the `PeriodIndex` instance.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    if not hasattr(self, '_period_weakref'):
        self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```

With this modification, the weakref to the `PeriodIndex` instance will be stored as an attribute of the instance, ensuring that it remains valid until it is no longer needed.

This fix should address the issue described in the GitHub bug report and allow the test case to return the expected output.
