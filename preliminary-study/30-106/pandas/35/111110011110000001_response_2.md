The error is occurring at `self._do_monotonic_check()`, where the `AttributeError` is raised because the `PeriodEngine` instance is set to `None`.

The buggy function `_engine` is supposed to return an instance of `PeriodEngine`, but it is currently returning `None`, which leads to the AttributeError during the `is_monotonic_increasing` check.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine` function returns an instance of `PeriodEngine` instead of `None`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return PeriodEngine(period, len(self))
```
