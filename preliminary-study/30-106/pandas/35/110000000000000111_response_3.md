Potential error location:
The potential error in the provided function lies in the fact that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is being dropped before intended, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

Reasons behind the bug:
The weakly referenced PeriodIndex is not being handled properly, resulting in the PeriodEngine not receiving the expected input, leading to the error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the _engine function to properly handle the weakly referenced PeriodIndex.
2. Ensure that the weakref.ref(self) is maintained throughout the function call to _engine_type.
3. Implement a mechanism to retain the weakly referenced PeriodIndex until it is no longer needed by _engine.

Corrected code:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        if not hasattr(wrapper, 'value'):
            wrapper.value = func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper.value
    return wrapper

# corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
