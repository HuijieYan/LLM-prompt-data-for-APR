Potential Error Location:
The bug seems to be related to the weak reference of the `PeriodIndex` being dropped before it's intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

Reasons Behind the Bug:
The weak reference of the `PeriodIndex` is not being handled correctly, leading to its premature dropping. This results in the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained until it is no longer needed by the `PeriodEngine`.
2. Verify that the `PeriodIndex` is correctly passed to the `PeriodEngine` without being prematurely dropped.

Corrected Code:
```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
        if not hasattr(self, '_cached_engine'):
            self._cached_engine = func(self, *args, **kwargs)
        return self._cached_engine
    return wrapper

# Corrected function with proper handling of weak reference
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
