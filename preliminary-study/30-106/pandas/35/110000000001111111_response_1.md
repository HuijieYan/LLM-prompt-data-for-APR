The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of weakref.ref(self). This is causing the weakly referenced PeriodIndex to be dropped before it is intended, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is not dropped prematurely. We can achieve this by modifying the function to hold a reference to the weakly referenced PeriodIndex until it is no longer needed.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

# this is the corrected function
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self._values)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._values))
```
