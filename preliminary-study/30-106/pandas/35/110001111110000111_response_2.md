The error message indicates an AttributeError is being raised in the `is_monotonic_increasing` method of the `IndexEngine` class, specifically at the line `return super(PeriodEngine, self).vgetter().view("i8")`. This suggests that the `_engine` method, which is used to create the `IndexEngine`, is returning `None` instead of the expected engine type, causing the AttributeError.

The bug occurs because the `_engine` method is using weakref to create a weak reference to `self`, but the weak reference is not being properly handled and is being dropped before it should. This results in the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` object instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, the weak reference to `self` should be properly handled in the `_engine` method to ensure that it is not dropped prematurely. One possible approach is to use a weak reference as a parameter to the `_engine_type` method instead of creating a weak reference to `self` and then passing it to `_engine_type`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` method:

```python
import weakref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
```

By directly passing `weakref.ref(self)` to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the weak reference to `self` is handled properly within the `_engine_type` method.
