Potential error location: 
The error may be occurring due to the use of the `@cache_readonly` decorator, which is not a standard Python decorator.

Reasons behind the bug:
1. The `@cache_readonly` decorator is not a standard Python decorator, which may be causing the error.
2. The use of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` may not be the correct approach.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use a standard Python decorator such as `@property` or `@staticmethod` if appropriate.
2. Use the correct approach to create a weak reference to `self` if necessary.

Corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/pandas_35/pandas/core/indexes/period.py

from functools import cached_property

# this is the corrected function
@cached_property
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
