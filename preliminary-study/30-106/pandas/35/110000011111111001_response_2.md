The error occurs in the `_engine` method, where it returns a new instance of `self._engine_type` without passing the weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`. This causes a reference cycle and returns a `NoneType` object, leading to the AttributeError in the test function.

To fix the bug:
1. Pass a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type` to avoid the reference cycle.
2. Ensure that the returned value is not a `NoneType` object.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` method:
```python
import weakref

def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is not None:
        return engine
    else:
        raise ValueError("Failed to create engine")
```
