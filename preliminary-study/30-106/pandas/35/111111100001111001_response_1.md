The bug is likely caused by using a weak reference in the _engine function. Weak references are typically used to avoid creating reference cycles, but in this context, it seems unnecessary.

To fix the bug, the weak reference to 'self' should be removed in the _engine function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self._data))
```
