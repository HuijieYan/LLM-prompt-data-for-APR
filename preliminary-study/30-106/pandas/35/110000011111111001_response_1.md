The error message is related to the "NoneType" object and the absence of the attribute 'view'. This indicates that the `self._engine` is returning a NoneType object, leading to the AttributeError.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the implementation of the `_engine` method itself. The use of `weakref.ref` is not sufficient in this case, leading to the issue where `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` returns a NoneType object.

The bug is occurring because the weak reference creation is not capturing the actual reference to `self`, and when `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` is invoked, it returns a NoneType object, leading to the AttributeError.

A possible approach to fix the bug is to implement the correct caching mechanism for the `_engine` method. This can be achieved by using `functools.lru_cache` or a custom caching mechanism to store and retrieve the `_engine` value.

Here's the corrected code with a custom caching mechanism:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(fn):
    cache_name = f'_cached_{fn.__name__}'
    
    @property
    def cached_func(self):
        if not hasattr(self, cache_name):
            period = weakref.ref(self)
            setattr(self, cache_name, self._engine_type(period, len(self)))
        return getattr(self, cache_name)
    
    return cached_func

def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))

# As the above fix addresses caching mechanism, consider verifying it with the provided test function and reloading it if necessary.
```
By implementing the custom caching mechanism, the `_engine` method now correctly caches the result of `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` and returns the cached value when called subsequently. This should resolve the AttributeError and the bug in the original code.
