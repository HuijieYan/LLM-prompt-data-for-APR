Potential Error: Use of the @cache_readonly decorator suggests that the intention is to cache the result of the _engine function, but the code currently does not include the implementation of the cache_readonly decorator.

Reason for the Bug: The code is using a decorator @cache_readonly which suggests that it is supposed to cache the result of the function, but the implementation of the cache_readonly decorator is missing.

Approach to Fix the Bug: Implement the cache_readonly decorator to cache the result of the _engine function.

Corrected Code:
```python
from functools import lru_cache

def cache_readonly(fn):
    @property
    @lru_cache
    def wrapper(self):
        return fn(self)
    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
In this corrected code, we have added the implementation of the cache_readonly decorator using the functools.lru_cache decorator, which will cache the result of the _engine function.
