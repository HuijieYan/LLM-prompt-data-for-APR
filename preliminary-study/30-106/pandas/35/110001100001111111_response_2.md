The issue seems to be related to weak references to a PeriodIndex being dropped before intended, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained until it is no longer needed by the PeriodEngine.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In this corrected code, we're using the weakref module to create a weak reference to the PeriodIndex before passing it to the _engine_type. This ensures that the reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained until it is no longer needed by the PeriodEngine, fixing the bug.
