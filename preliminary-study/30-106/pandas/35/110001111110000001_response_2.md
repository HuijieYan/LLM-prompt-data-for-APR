1. The test case is trying to access the `is_monotonic` attribute of the `MultiIndex` object `idx2` and is encountering an AttributeError related to the `view` method.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the `_engine` method, specifically the line `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.

3. The error message is indicating that the `_engine` method is returning a `NoneType` object, which is causing the AttributeError when the `is_monotonic_increasing` attribute is accessed on this object.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine` method returns a valid object of the intended type, and that it does not return a `NoneType`. This may involve reviewing the initialization of the `_engine_type` and confirming that it is properly instantiated.

5. Corrected code for the `_engine` method:
```python
import weakref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("Engine initialization failed")
    return engine
```
