The error message indicates that there is an AttributeError because a 'NoneType' object is being accessed for an attribute 'view'. This suggests that the _engine function is not returning a valid object, resulting in the AttributeError.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the return statement in the _engine function:
```python
return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is being dropped prematurely, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving a None object instead of the PeriodIndex.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is maintained until the PeriodEngine has finished using it. This can be achieved by modifying the _engine function to properly handle the weak reference.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/pandas_35/pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine
```

By returning the 'engine' object after creating it using the weak reference 'period', we can ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is still available for the PeriodEngine to use, fixing the premature dropping of the weak reference.
