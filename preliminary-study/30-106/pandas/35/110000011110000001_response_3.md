The error message is from the test function `test_get_level_values_when_periods`. It is trying to assert that all levels of `idx2` are monotonic, but encounters an AttributeError when trying to determine whether or not the levels are monotonic.

The potential error location is likely within the `_engine` method being used to create the `idx2` object.

The reason behind the AttributeError is that the `self._engine_type` method called within the `_engine` method is returning a `NoneType` object instead of the expected engine object.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine_type` method returns the correct engine object.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` method:

```python
from functools import wraps

def cache_readonly(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
        if not hasattr(self, '_cached_engine'):
            self._cached_engine = self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
        return self._cached_engine
    return wrapper

# Corrected _engine method
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
```
