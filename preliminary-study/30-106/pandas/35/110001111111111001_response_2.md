The error occurs when a property or method is being called on a NoneType object, indicating that the _engine_type method is not returning the expected value.

The potential error location is within the _engine method, where the _engine_type method is being called.

The bug occurred because the _engine_type method is not returning the expected value, and therefore, the _engine method returns an incorrect value.

To fix this bug, ensure that the _engine_type method is returning the correct value of type `<class 'pandas._libs.index.PeriodEngine'>`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/pandas_35/pandas/core/indexes/period.py

from functools import cached_property

@cached_property
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using cached_property instead of cache_readonly, we ensure that the _engine method returns the expected value and type, addressing the bug present in the original code.
