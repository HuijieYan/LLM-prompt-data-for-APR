The error occurs when trying to access the `is_monotonic` attribute of `idx2.levels`. This attribute relies on the `_engine` attribute of the `PeriodIndex`. The error message indicates that the `_engine` attribute is None, which leads to an AttributeError when trying to retrieve the view of the attribute.

The bug likely occurs within the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class. The `_engine` method is annotated with `@cache_readonly`, which means it should return a cached value, but it seems that it returns the `_engine_type` without caching it.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` method should return the result of instantiating the `_engine_type` with a weak reference to `self` and caching the result for future calls.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` method:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    self._engine_cached = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return self._engine_cached
```
