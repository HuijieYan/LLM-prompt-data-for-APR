Potential error location: The _engine function is returning a weak reference to the period object, but it seems to be creating an issue related to attribute 'view'.

Reasons behind the bug: The weak reference is not being maintained properly in the _engine function, leading to an AttributeError when attempting to access the 'view' attribute.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Instead of returning a weak reference to the period object, return the actual reference to prevent weak reference issues.
2. Ensure that the _engine function is properly handling the reference to the period object and accessing its attributes without any weak reference-related problems.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the fixed function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
