Potential Error Location: The error seems to be originating from the _engine method of the PeriodIndex class.

Reasons behind the Bug: The bug is likely occurring because the _engine method is not returning the expected type of object, resulting in the 'NoneType' object error when trying to access its attribute 'view'.

Approach for Fixing the Bug: We need to ensure that the _engine method returns the correct type of object to avoid the 'NoneType' error.

Corrected Code:

```python
import weakref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self.indexMap))
```
In the corrected code, we create a weak reference to the 'self' object and then pass it to the _engine_type method along with the length of the indexMap. This should ensure that the correct type of object is returned, fixing the 'NoneType' error.
