The error message indicates that there is a `NoneType` object and that it does not have the attribute 'view'. This suggests that the `_engine_type` function is returning `None` instead of the expected engine object.

The potential error location is within the `_engine` method. It seems that the `_engine_type` function is not returning the expected engine object, causing the AttributeError when trying to access the 'view' attribute.

The bug is occurring because the `_engine` method is not returning the expected engine object due to the `_engine_type` function returning `None` instead.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` method should handle the case where `_engine_type` returns None and possibly handle other edge cases as well. Additionally, the `_engine_type` function should be revisited to ensure that it is returning the correct engine object.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from functools import wraps
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
        if not hasattr(self, '_cached_engine'):
            self._cached_engine = func(self, *args, **kwargs)
        return self._cached_engine
    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("_engine_type returned None")
    return engine
```

In the corrected code, the `cache_readonly` decorator has been added. This decorator is used to cache the result of the `_engine` method, ensuring that it is only computed once and then reused on subsequent calls. Additionally, it checks if the `_engine_type` function returns None and raises a ValueError in that case.
