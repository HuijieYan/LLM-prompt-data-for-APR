The error message indicates that the `_engine` method is trying to access an attribute of a `NoneType` object, which means that `_engine` is not returning the expected object of type `PeriodEngine`. This leads to the AttributeError when trying to access the `view()` method from a `NoneType` object.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine` method returns an instance of `PeriodEngine` and that it is properly initialized with the required parameters.

Based on the code provided, I will rewrite the `_engine` method to directly create an instance of `PeriodEngine` and pass the necessary parameters to its constructor.

```python
import weakref
from pandas import _libs

def cache_readonly(func):
    cached_name = "_cached_" + func.__name__
    
    def wrapped(self):
        if not hasattr(self, cached_name):
            setattr(self, cached_name, func(self))
        return getattr(self, cached_name)
    
    return wrapped

def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return _libs.index.PeriodEngine(period, len(self))

# Updated code for the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return _libs.index.PeriodEngine(period(), len(self))
```
