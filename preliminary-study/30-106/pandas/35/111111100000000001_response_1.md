The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of `weakref.ref(self)`.

The bug occurs because `weakref.ref(self)` creates a weak reference to `self`, but it is not being used properly to avoid a reference cycle.

To fix the bug, we can modify the _engine function to use weak references properly and avoid the reference cycle.

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
