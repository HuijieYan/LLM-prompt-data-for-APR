Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is within the `_engine` method where the `weakref.ref(self)` is used to create a weak reference to the `self` object, which is a PeriodIndex. This weak reference is then used to create an instance of `_engine_type`.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is being dropped before intended, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a `None` instead of the PeriodIndex.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the weak reference to the PeriodIndex object (`self`) should be held for the lifetime of the `_engine` object. This can be achieved by storing the weak reference as an instance variable of the `_engine` object. This will ensure that the PeriodEngine does not receive a `None` instead of the PeriodIndex.

Corrected Code:
```python
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    # ... (other code) ...

    # Corrected _engine method
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Hold the weak reference to self as an instance variable of _engine
        self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```

In the corrected code, the weak reference to the PeriodIndex object is stored as `self._period_weakref`. This ensures that the weak reference is held for the lifetime of the `_engine` object, preventing the bug where the PeriodEngine receives a `None` instead of the PeriodIndex.
