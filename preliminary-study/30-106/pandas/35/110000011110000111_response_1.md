1. The test case `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is trying to create a MultiIndex from a PeriodIndex and then check if all levels are monotonic. The error occurs when trying to check monotonicity, indicating an issue with the `_engine` function.

2. The potential error location within the `_engine` function is likely the return statement: `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. The error message suggests that `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` is returning a `NoneType` object, which leads to the AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute.

3. The bug occurs because the weak reference to `self` (in the line `period = weakref.ref(self)`) might not be appropriately retained, causing the `_engine_type` function to receive a `None` instead of the intended `period`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Ensure that the weak reference to `self` is retained appropriately so that it is not dropped before the intended time.
   - Check if the `_engine_type` function is handling weak references correctly and if it is returning the expected type.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
        if not hasattr(self, '_cached_value'):
            self._cached_value = func(self, *args, **kwargs)
        return self._cached_value
    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_result = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine_result is not None:
        return engine_result
    else:
        raise ValueError("Failed to initialize engine")
```
