The error message indicates that the `_engine` attribute is returning a `NoneType` object, which leads to an AttributeError when the `vgetter()` method is called on it. This suggests that there might be a problem with the implementation of the `_engine` method.

The bug occurs because the `_engine` method is not correctly returning the expected engine type, which in turn leads to a `NoneType` object being returned. This causes the subsequent `vgetter()` method call to fail with an AttributeError.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` method needs to be modified to correctly return the engine type and avoid returning a `NoneType` object.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` method:

```python
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import PeriodArray
import weakref

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/pandas_35/pandas/core/indexes/period.py

def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if isinstance(self._engine_type, type) else self._engine_type
```

In this corrected code, we're checking if `self._engine_type` is an instance of `type` before calling it. Additionally, if `self._engine_type` is not a type, we're returning it directly. This should prevent the `NoneType` object from being returned, fixing the bug.
