The error message indicates that the issue is with the `PeriodEngine` and `IndexEngine` classes. The error occurs when trying to access the `view` attribute of a `NoneType` object, meaning that the `_engine` function responsible for creating or initializing the `PeriodEngine` is not working as intended.

The bug occurs because the `_engine` method is returning a `None` object instead of the expected `PeriodEngine` object, causing subsequent method calls to fail.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that the `_engine` method returns a valid `PeriodEngine` object. This can be achieved by properly instantiating and returning an instance of `PeriodEngine` within the `_engine` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `PeriodIndex` class with the fixed `_engine` method:

```python
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    # ... other code ...

    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Instantiate and return an instance of PeriodEngine
        return PeriodEngine(self, len(self))
```

By instantiating and returning the `PeriodEngine` object, the bug should be fixed, and subsequent method calls involving the `PeriodEngine` should work as intended.
