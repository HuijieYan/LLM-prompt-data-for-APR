The error is occurring in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The function tries to create a weak reference to the `self` object, which is a `PeriodIndex` instance, to avoid a reference cycle. However, it seems that the weak reference is not working correctly, and the `PeriodEngine` is getting a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, you can modify the `_engine` function to ensure that the weak reference to the `self` object is properly created and used. Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
from weakref import ref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

In this corrected code, I have used the `ref` function from the `weakref` module to create a weak reference to the `self` object. This ensures that the reference to the `PeriodIndex` is weak and does not keep the object alive longer than necessary.

By making this change, the weak reference is now properly created, and the `PeriodEngine` will receive the expected weak reference to the `PeriodIndex`. This should resolve the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
