The error message indicates that the bug is likely in the `_engine` function of the PeriodIndex class, as it seems to be returning a NoneType object, which does not have the attribute 'view'. This is causing an AttributeError.

The bug is occurring because the weak reference to `self` (PeriodIndex) is not being properly maintained when creating `idx2`, which leads to the `_engine` function receiving a None instead of the expected PeriodIndex.

To fix this bug, the `_engine` function needs to properly maintain the weak reference to `self` when creating the engine. This can be achieved by using the `weakref` module to create a weak reference to the `self` object and then using it to create the engine.

Here is the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
import weakref

def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

By making this change, the weak reference to `self` will be maintained properly, and the bug causing the AttributeError will be fixed.
