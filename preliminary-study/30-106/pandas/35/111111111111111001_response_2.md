The error message indicates an AttributeError when calling the `view("i8")` method on a `NoneType` object. This suggests that the variable in question is `None` when it shouldn't be. The error occurs while attempting to access the `view()` method on a `NoneType` object.

In the buggy function `_engine`, the issue seems to be with the return value `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. It is likely that the `_engine_type` method is returning `None`, causing the subsequent error when trying to access the `view()` method on `None`.

To fix this issue, you should ensure that the `_engine_type` method returns a valid object that has the `view()` method.

Corrected code:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        # Handle the case when _engine_type returns None
        raise ValueError("_engine_type returned None instead of a valid engine")
    return engine
```
