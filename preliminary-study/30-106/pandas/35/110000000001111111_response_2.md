The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of weakref.ref(self) to create a weak reference to self when creating the period variable.

The bug occurs because weakref.ref(self) creates a weak reference to self, but it is assigned to period without being used. Instead, the function should directly pass a weak reference of self to _engine_type.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to pass a weak reference of self to _engine_type. 

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

This change ensures that a weak reference to self is passed to _engine_type, addressing the issue of losing weakrefs and resolving the bug.
