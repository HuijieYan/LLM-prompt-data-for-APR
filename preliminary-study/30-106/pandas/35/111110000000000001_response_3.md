Potential Error Location:
The error likely occurs in the _engine function, particularly with the use of weakref.ref(self) and self._engine_type(period, len(self)).

Reasons for the Bug:
The use of weakref.ref(self) seems unnecessary and may be causing the error. Additionally, it's possible that self._engine_type(period, len(self)) is not being used correctly.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Remove the weakref.ref(self) and see if the error resolves.
2. Ensure that the self._engine_type(period, len(self)) is being used correctly and if necessary, correct the usage.

Corrected Code:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
