The issue stems from the `_engine` method within the `PeriodIndex` class, which utilizes weakref to create a weak reference to the `self` object. However, the weak reference is not being utilized properly, leading to a `NoneType` error when the `_engine` method is called within the `is_monotonic_increasing()` method.

To resolve this issue, the weak reference should be maintained properly in the `_engine` method to ensure that it is not prematurely garbage collected. This can be achieved by creating a strong reference to the weak reference object within the `_engine` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    self._engine_weakref = period  # Creating a strong reference to the weak reference object
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By creating a strong reference to the weak reference object, the issue of premature garbage collection is resolved, and the `NoneType` error should no longer occur. This should address the problem described in the GitHub issue.
