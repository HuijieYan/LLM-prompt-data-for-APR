The bug seems to be related to weak reference handling in the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class. Since the error message suggests that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before it should be, it seems that the weak reference is not being handled properly, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` object instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained and passed correctly to the `PeriodEngine`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._data))
```

In the corrected code, we are using a weak reference to `self` and passing it to the `_engine_type` along with the length of the data. This should ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained and passed correctly to the `PeriodEngine`, fixing the bug related to weak reference handling.
