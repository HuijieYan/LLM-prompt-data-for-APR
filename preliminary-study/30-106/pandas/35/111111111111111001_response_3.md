The error occurs in the `PeriodIndex._engine` function. This function is using a weak reference to the `self` object, but it's not handling the weak reference properly. This leads to an attribute error when trying to access the weakly referenced object.

To fix this, the function should use the weak reference correctly to access the `self` object.

Here's the corrected code for the `PeriodIndex._engine` function:

```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:  # handle the weak reference correctly
        raise ValueError("Engine not created successfully")
    return engine
```
