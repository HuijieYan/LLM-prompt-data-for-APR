The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `period = weakref.ref(self)`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the weak reference `weakref.ref(self)` is assigned to a local variable `period` but it is not being used anywhere in the function. Instead, the function implementation is trying to use `self` directly as the weak reference.

To fix the bug, we should remove the line `period = weakref.ref(self)` and directly pass `weakref.ref(self)` to `_engine_type` as an argument.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
```
