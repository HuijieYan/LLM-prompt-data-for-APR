Potential error location:
The issue seems to be with the weak reference to the `self` object being passed to the `_engine_type` function. It appears that the weak reference is not being properly maintained, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

Reasons behind the bug:
The weak reference to the `self` object is not being handled properly, which leads to it being dropped before it's intended to. This results in the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the expected PeriodIndex.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix this bug, it's necessary to ensure that the weak reference to the self object is maintained throughout the `_engine` function and passed properly to the `_engine_type` function. This will prevent the PeriodEngine from receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

Corrected code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/pandas_35/pandas/core/indexes/period.py

import weakref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    weak_self = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weak_self(), len(self))
```
