Potential error location:
The potential error location is in the line `period = weakref.ref(self)`. The intention seems to be to create a weak reference to the `self` object, but the implementation is incorrect.

Reasons behind the bug:
The bug occurs because the weak reference is not used correctly. The `weakref.ref()` function should be used to create a weak reference, but it is not being utilized properly in this context.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the correct usage of `weakref.ref()` should be employed to create a weak reference to the `self` object. This can be done by passing `self` as an argument to `weakref.ref()`.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
