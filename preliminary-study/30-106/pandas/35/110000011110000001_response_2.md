1. The test case is trying to create a MultiIndex from PeriodIndex and then retrieve the level values. However, it encounters an error when checking if the values are monotonic.

2. The potential error location is within the `_engine` method, particularly in the line `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.

3. The error message indicates that the `_engine` is returning a `NoneType` object, leading to an attribute error when trying to access the `view` attribute. This suggests that the `_engine` method is not returning the expected type of object.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine` method returns the appropriate object type, which in this case is likely to be `PeriodEngine` or a similar object that has the necessary attributes and methods to support the operations being performed in the test case.

5. Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    """
    Decorator that converts a method with a single `self` argument into a 
    property cached on the instance.
    """
    propname = f'_cached_{func.__name__}'

    def cached(self):
        if not hasattr(self, propname):
            setattr(self, propname, func(self))
        return getattr(self, propname)

    return property(cached)

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Use appropriate object type here, e.g., PeriodEngine
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
