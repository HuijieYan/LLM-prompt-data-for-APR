The test case `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `MultiIndex` from an array of `PeriodIndex` objects and then tries to check if each level of the `MultiIndex` is monotonic.

The bug occurs in the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class. It seems like the method is not properly returning the engine type, which results in an AttributeError when the `is_monotonic` check is performed.

The reason for the bug could be that the `_engine` method is not returning the correct engine type. This could be due to a misconfiguration or a problem with the weak reference passed to the `_engine_type` constructor.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` method should be modified to return the correct engine type without any AttributeError. This can be done by ensuring that the weak reference is passed correctly and that the engine type is properly initialized and returned.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` method:

```python
import weakref

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/pandas_35/pandas/core/indexes/period.py

def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type()(period, len(self))
```

With these changes, the `WeakRef` of `self` is correctly passed and the engine type is initialized and returned without any issues.
