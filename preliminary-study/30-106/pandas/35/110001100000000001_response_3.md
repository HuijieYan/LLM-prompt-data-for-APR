Potential error location: The error could be occurring in the use of 'weakref.ref(self)' and its relationship with the 'self._engine_type(period, len(self))' method.

Reasons behind the bug: The use of weak references with 'self' may not be correct, and it could be leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: We can use a more standard way of creating a weak reference to 'self' and then passing it to the '_engine_type' method.

Corrected code:

```python
import weakref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```
