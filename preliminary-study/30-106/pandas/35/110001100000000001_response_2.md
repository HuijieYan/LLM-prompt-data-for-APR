In the provided code, the issue seems to be with using the @cache_readonly decorator, which is not defined in the code snippet. Additionally, the weakref module seems to be used incorrectly.

Potential error location:
The use of @cache_readonly decorator and weakref.ref() function.

Reason for the bug:
The @cache_readonly decorator is not defined in the code, and the weakref.ref() function is not used properly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Define the @cache_readonly decorator if it is a custom decorator, or use an appropriate caching mechanism.
2. Use the weakref.proxy() function instead of weakref.ref() to create a weak reference to 'self'.

Corrected code:
```python
import weakref

def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
In the corrected code, I have imported the weakref module and used the weakref.proxy() function to create a weak reference to 'self' instead of weakref.ref(). This should fix the issue related to the incorrect use of weakref.
