The error occurs when the `test_get_level_values_when_periods` function is called. It seems to be related to the `is_monotonic` method call in the `assert` statement. The error message indicates that the `view` method is being called on a `NoneType` object, which suggests that the `_engine` attribute is returning `None` instead of the expected type.

The issue likely stems from the `_engine` method implementation, where it fails to return the expected type or returns `None` unexpectedly.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` method should be modified to return the correct type and ensure that it does not return `None` unexpectedly.

Here is the corrected `_engine` method:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/pandas_35/pandas/core/indexes/period.py

from weakref import ref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = ref(self)
    return super()._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This updated implementation should ensure that the `_engine` method returns the correct type and avoids returning `None` unexpectedly.
