The potential error location within the problematic function is the usage of the weakly referenced PeriodIndex, which is getting dropped before intended. This results in the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex, causing the AttributeError.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference of self (PeriodIndex) is preserved until it is no longer needed. We can do this by making use of a weak reference proxy and ensuring that self is not garbage collected prematurely.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using weakref.proxy instead of weakref.ref, we ensure that the weak reference of self remains valid until it is no longer needed, preventing premature garbage collection and resolving the AttributeError.
