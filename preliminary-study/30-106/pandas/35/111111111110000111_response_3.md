The error occurs in the `test_get_level_values_when_periods` function, where it tries to check if all index levels in `idx2` are monotonic. However, it fails with an AttributeError because the `PeriodEngine` gets a None instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

The bug is likely occurring in the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class, which is returning a value of `None` instead of the `PeriodEngine` instance that is expected.

To fix this bug, the `_engine` method should be modified to return the correct `PeriodEngine` instance. It is likely that the weak reference to `self` (the `PeriodIndex` instance) is not being correctly utilized to create the `PeriodEngine` instance.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In this corrected code, `period()` is called to create the `PeriodIndex` from the weak reference, providing the correct reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance for the `PeriodEngine`.

Once this fix is applied, the test case `test_get_level_values_when_periods` should pass without raising the AttributeError.
