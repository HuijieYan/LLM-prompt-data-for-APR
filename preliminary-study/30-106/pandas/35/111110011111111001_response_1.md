The bug seems to be occurring in the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class. The error message indicates that there is an `AttributeError` related to `NoneType` object having no attribute 'view'. This suggests that there is an issue with accessing an attribute of an object that is expected to be of a certain type but is instead `None`.

Upon analyzing the `_engine` method, it seems that `weakref.ref(self)` is being assigned to the `period` variable, which might be causing the issue. In the context of the bug, the `self._engine_type` variable may not be behaving as expected and returning `None`, leading to the `AttributeError` when trying to access the 'view' attribute.

Possible approaches to fixing this bug include:

1. Checking the implementation of `self._engine_type` and ensuring that it returns the expected type of object.
2. Verifying the usage of weak references and how they might be affecting the behavior of `self._engine_type`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    engine_type = self._engine_type
    if engine_type is not None:
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return engine_type(period, len(self))
    else:
        raise ValueError("Engine type is not defined")
```
