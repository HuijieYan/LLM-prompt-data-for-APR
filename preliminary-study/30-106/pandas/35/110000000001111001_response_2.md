The error in the provided code is that the `@cache_readonly` decorator is not a built-in decorator in Python, so it will cause a NameError. Additionally, the use of weakref.ref function seems unnecessary in this context.

The _engine function is supposed to return an instance of the self._engine_type class, passing the self and len(self) as arguments.

To fix the bug, we can remove the @cache_readonly decorator and the weakref.ref function, and simply return an instance of the self._engine_type class.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

With this correction, the function will return an instance of self._engine_type with the appropriate arguments, as expected.
