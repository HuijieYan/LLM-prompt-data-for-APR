The potential error in the buggy function lies in the weakref.ref() function, which is not being used correctly. The weakref.ref() function returns a weak reference to the object, but it is not being assigned to any variable in this case. Additionally, the _engine() function is not correctly utilizing the weak reference to avoid a reference cycle.

To fix the bug, we need to properly use weak reference and avoid the reference cycle.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/pandas_35/pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._values))
```

In the corrected code, we properly assign the weak reference to the variable 'period' and use it when calling the _engine_type() function. This ensures that a reference cycle is avoided and the function works as intended.
