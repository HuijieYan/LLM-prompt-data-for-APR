The error occurs in the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class. The error message indicates that the method is returning a `NoneType` object, leading to an `AttributeError` when attempting to access the `view` attribute. This points to a problem with the `_engine` method returning `None` instead of the expected object.

The reason behind this bug is that the `_engine` method is not functioning as intended and is returning `None` instead of the expected result, likely due to an issue with the weak reference to `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, the `_engine` method should be modified to ensure that it returns the intended object, addressing any issues with the weak reference and the creation of the `PeriodEngine` object.

The corrected code for the `_engine` method in the `PeriodIndex` class is as follows:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine
```

In this corrected code, the `engine` object is created using the `_engine_type` class attribute, ensuring that the intended object is returned by the `_engine` method. This should resolve the issue with the weak reference and the subsequent `NoneType` error.
