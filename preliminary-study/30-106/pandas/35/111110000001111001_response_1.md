The issue in the provided code is that the _engine function is returning a new PeriodEngine instance without passing the required parameters. The expected behavior is for the _engine function to return a new PeriodEngine instance with the provided parameters.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the _engine function to pass the required parameters to the PeriodEngine constructor.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    weakref_self = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weakref_self, len(self))
```
