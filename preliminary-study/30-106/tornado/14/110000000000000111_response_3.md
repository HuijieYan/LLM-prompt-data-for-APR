Potential error location: The potential error in the code is the logic for checking if the IOLoop is already current or not.

Reason for the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the logic to check if the IOLoop is already current or not is not implemented correctly. As a result, the function does not handle the case where the IOLoop is already current properly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Check if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None and make the necessary updates accordingly.
2. Use a more streamlined approach to check if the IOLoop is current and handle the cases appropriately.

Corrected code:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected code, the logic to check if the IOLoop is current has been updated to handle the case where the IOLoop is already current. The if condition in the `elif make_current` block has been updated to check if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None, and then raise a RuntimeError if the IOLoop is already current.
