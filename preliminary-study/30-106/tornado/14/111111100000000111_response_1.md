The problem in the `initialize` function is that it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None or not before deciding whether to raise an error for "current IOLoop already exists". This is contradictory, as it first checks if the current IOLoop exists and then raises an error if it does not exist.

The bug occurs because the if-else conditions are not properly handling the logic to check if the IOLoop instance already exists.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `initialize` function to properly check if the IOLoop instance already exists and raise an error accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function first checks for the current IOLoop instance and based on that condition, it either sets the current IOLoop or raises an error if it already exists.
