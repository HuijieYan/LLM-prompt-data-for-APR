The error message indicates that the test function `test_force_current` is trying to create a new `IOLoop` with `make_current=True`, but it fails with a `RuntimeError` stating that "current IOLoop already exists". This suggests that the issue lies within the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class, specifically in the conditional statements that handle the `make_current` parameter.

The potential error location within the `initialize` method is the conditional statement that checks if `make_current` is `None`. If `make_current` is `None`, it should make the current instance only if it doesn't exist, but the logic is incorrect.

The bug occurs because of the incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter. The conditional statement is not properly checking if the current instance already exists before attempting to make it current. Additionally, the `elif make_current` block also has a logic flaw as it doesn't properly handle the case when the current instance already exists.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` method should be modified to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and check for the existence of the current instance before making it current.

Here's the corrected function/method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:  # Changed to compare for True
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Changed the condition to check if current instance exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
