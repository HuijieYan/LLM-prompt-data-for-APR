The error occurs when the `initialize` function is called with `make_current=True`. Within the `initialize` function, the code checks if there is a current IOLoop, and if not, it calls `self.make_current()`. However, if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current IOLoop, it should raise a `RuntimeError`, which is currently not being handled correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `initialize` function to properly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current IOLoop.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    else:
        # Handle the case when make_current is False
        pass
```

In the corrected function, we added an extra condition to check if `make_current` is `True`. If `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current IOLoop, it will raise a `RuntimeError` as expected. If `make_current` is `True` and there is no current IOLoop, then `self.make_current()` will be called.
