The error message indicates that the RuntimeError is being raised when make_current is set to True, even though IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None.

The issue is occurring in the initialize method. It checks if make_current is None, and if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None, then it calls self.make_current(). If make_current is not None, it checks if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None, and if it's not None, then it raises a RuntimeError.

The bug occurs because when make_current is True, it first checks if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None, and if it is, it calls self.make_current(). However, even if make_current is True, it still goes to the next condition and checks if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None, which leads to the RuntimeError being raised.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the redundant check for IOLoop.current(instance=False) when make_current is True.

Here's the corrected code for the initialize method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected code, when make_current is not None, it directly checks if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None and raises a RuntimeError if it is, otherwise, it calls self.make_current(). When make_current is None, it follows the previous behavior of checking if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None and then calling self.make_current().

This change ensures that the RuntimeError is only raised when make_current is not None and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None.
