Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the logic inside the `initialize` method. When `make_current` is not provided, it checks if the current IOLoop instance is None and then calls `make_current()`. When `make_current` is True, it checks if the current IOLoop instance is not None and then calls `make_current()`. The logic seems to be incorrect.

Reasons behind the bug: The conditional logic inside the `initialize` method is inconsistent. It does not properly handle the scenarios when `make_current` is None or when it is True.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. When `make_current` is None, only call `make_current()` if the current IOLoop instance is None. 
2. When `make_current` is True, call `make_current()` only if the current IOLoop instance is not None.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:  # If make_current is not provided
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:  # If the current IOLoop instance is None
            self.make_current()  # Call make_current
    elif make_current:  # If make_current is True
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # If the current IOLoop instance is not None
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")  # Raise a RuntimeError
        self.make_current()  # Call make_current
```

In this corrected code, the logic for handling the scenarios when `make_current` is None or True is adjusted so that the function behaves as expected.
