The problem seems to be occurring in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The error message indicates that when `make_current` is set to `True`, the method is trying to create a new current `IOLoop` when one already exists, resulting in a `RuntimeError` being raised.

The bug occurs because the logic in the `initialize` method is incorrect. When `make_current` is set to `True`, the method should check if a current `IOLoop` already exists. If it does, then a `RuntimeError` should be raised. However, if a current `IOLoop` does not exist, then `make_current` should be called to make the current instance.

To fix this bug, the `initialize` method should be updated as follows:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected code, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is checking if a current `IOLoop` does not exist, and the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` is checking if a current `IOLoop` already exists. These conditions are switched to ensure the expected behavior.

This should fix the bug and ensure that the `IOLoop` is initialized correctly.
