Potential error location: The potential error in the provided function is that it is not handling the logic for `make_current` parameter correctly. 

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The logic for checking if the IOLoop instance already exists or not is not handled properly. Additionally, the conditional statement for `make_current` is also incorrect.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Check if `make_current` is None and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None, then call `self.make_current()`.
- If `make_current` is not None and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None, then raise a RuntimeError.
- If `make_current` is False, do nothing.

Corrected code:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
