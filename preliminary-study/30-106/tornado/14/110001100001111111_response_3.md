1. The test case involves the input parameters make_current=True and an instance of the KQueueIOLoop class as self. The buggy code is attempting to check if the current IOLoop instance does not exist and then either create a new one or raise a RuntimeError if it already exists.

2. The potential error location within the initialize function is the conditional statement that checks if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None.

3. The bug occurs because the code first checks if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None, and then if it is not, it proceeds to either create a new IOLoop instance or raise a RuntimeError. This logic is flawed because if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None, the code should not proceed to try to create a new IOLoop instance. 

4. To fix the bug, the condition should be reversed so that if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None, it should raise a RuntimeError. Additionally, the code should be refactored to make the logic clearer and more concise.

5. Below is the corrected code for the initialize function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected code, the check for the current IOLoop instance being None is done first. If make_current is None, it creates a new IOLoop instance if none exists. If make_current is not None, it raises a RuntimeError if an IOLoop instance already exists and creates a new one otherwise.
