Potential error location:
The bug seems to be occurring in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. Specifically, the logic in the `initialize` method related to the `make_current` parameter seems to be causing the issue.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The `initialize` method is checking if a current `IOLoop` exists and then determining whether to make the current `IOLoop` or raise an error based on the value of the `make_current` parameter. The issue may arise due to incorrect logic in this conditional check.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the conditional check for the `make_current` parameter.
2. Ensure that the `make_current` argument behaves as expected, i.e., if `make_current=True`, it should force the new `IOLoop` to become the current one, while if `make_current=False`, it should not try to become the current one.
3. Handle the case where `make_current` is `True`, but the current `IOLoop` already exists.

Corrected code:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if not IOLoop.current(instance=False):
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False):
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
In the corrected code:
- In the `initialize` method, the condition `if not IOLoop.current(instance=False):` is used to check if there is no current `IOLoop` and then make the current `IOLoop`.
- The `elif make_current` condition is modified to check if `IOLoop` already exists; if it does, it raises a `RuntimeError`.
- The corrected code handles the case where `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` already exists, preventing a new `make_current` call from succeeding.

These changes should address the issue and fix the bug in the `initialize` method.
