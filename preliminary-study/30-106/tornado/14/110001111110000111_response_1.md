The test case `test_force_current` tries to initialize an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and then checks if the `IOLoop.current()` is the same as the initialized instance. However, when it tries to initialize a second `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, it raises a `RuntimeError` because the `IOLoop.current()` already exists.

The potential error location is within the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class, specifically in the logic that handles the `make_current` parameter.

The issue arises because the logic to check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None is providing unexpected behavior. It is meant to check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists, but the logic is flawed.

To fix the bug, we can change the `initialize` method's logic to directly check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists, instead of the current indirect logic.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=True):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the method now directly checks if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists before trying to make the current instance. If it does, it raises a `RuntimeError` as expected.
