The error is occurring when the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class is being called with `make_current=True`. The `initialize` method then checks if the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, and if not, it raises a `RuntimeError`.

The issue seems to be with the conditional check for `make_current=True`. It should only raise a `RuntimeError` if `IOLoop.current` is not `None`, but the current implementation always raises a `RuntimeError` when `make_current=True`.

To fix this bug, we should change the conditional statement in the `initialize` method to only raise a `RuntimeError` if `IOLoop.current` is not `None` when `make_current=True`.

The corrected code for the `initialize` method is as follows:

```python
# Corrected initialize method
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This correction ensures that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when `make_current=True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
