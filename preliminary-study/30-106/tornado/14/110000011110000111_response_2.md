The test case 'test_force_current' is attempting to create an IOLoop instance with make_current set to True. This should set the new IOLoop instance as the current instance. However, the error message indicates that the RuntimeError is being raised because "current IOLoop already exists". This suggests that the logic within the 'initialize' function is incorrect.

The potential error location is within the 'initialize' function, specifically in the conditional statements.

The bug occurs because the logic to check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance is not functioning as intended. The if-else conditions are not properly checking if the IOLoop instance exists or not.

To fix this bug, the conditional statements need to be adjusted to properly check if the IOLoop instance exists and handle the make_current parameter accordingly.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected function, we first store the current IOLoop instance in the 'current_instance' variable. Then we modify the conditional statements to properly check if 'current_instance' is None or not, and handle the 'make_current' parameter accordingly.

This fix should address the issue raised in the test case and prevent the RuntimeError from being incorrectly raised.
