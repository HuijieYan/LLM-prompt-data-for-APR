The issue seems to be related to the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The `initialize` method takes an argument `make_current` which by default is set to `None`. Inside the `initialize` method, there is a check to see if the `make_current` argument is `None` and if the current instance of `IOLoop` is `None`, then it makes the current instance. If `make_current` is set to `True`, then it checks if the current instance of `IOLoop` is `None` and raises an error if it already exists.

The issue seems to be arising because when `make_current` is set to `True`, it should not raise an error if the current instance is `None`.

To fix this issue, we should modify the logic inside the `initialize` method to correctly handle the `make_current` argument.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:  # If make_current is not provided
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:  # If make_current is explicitly set to True
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected code, we first store the current instance of `IOLoop` in the variable `current_instance`. Then, we check the value of `make_current`. If it is `None`, we check if the current instance is `None` and make it the current instance if needed. If `make_current` is `True`, we check if the current instance is not `None` and raise an error if it already exists. If the current instance is `None`, then it becomes the current instance.

This corrected logic should address the issue and handle the `make_current` argument appropriately.
