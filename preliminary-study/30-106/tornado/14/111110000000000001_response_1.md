The potential error in the "initialize" function is that it is trying to call methods like "IOLoop.current(instance=False)" and "self.make_current()" without having them defined within the class. This will result in a AttributeError because these methods are not defined.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the "initialize" function is trying to call methods that do not exist within the class.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to define the "IOLoop.current(instance=False)" and "self.make_current()" methods within the class.

Here's the corrected code for the "initialize" function:

```python
# this is the corrected initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
