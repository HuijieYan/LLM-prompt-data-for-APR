Potential error location: The if-else conditions and the function call self.make_current().

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. The first if condition checks if make_current is None, and if IOLoop.current() is None, then it calls self.make_current(). However, the self.make_current() method is not defined within the function itself.
2. The elif condition is supposed to check if make_current is True and IOLoop.current() is not None, but the if condition should be checking for not None and not None.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Define the make_current() method within the class containing the initialize() function.
2. Correct the if-else conditions to check for the correct scenarios.

Corrected code:
```python
# Corrected function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_loop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_loop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if current_loop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
