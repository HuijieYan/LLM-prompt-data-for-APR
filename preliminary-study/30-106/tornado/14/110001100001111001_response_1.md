Potential Error Location:
The error is likely occurring in the `initialize` function, specifically in the conditional statements that check the `make_current` parameter and the current IOLoop instance.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
In the buggy code, when `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop instance already exists, the function should raise a `RuntimeError`. However, instead of checking if `make_current` is `True`, it checks if `make_current` is not `None`, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check for the exact value of `make_current` (True or False) rather than checking if it is not None.
2. Ensure that the conditional statements correctly handle the case when an IOLoop instance already exists.

Corrected Code:
```python
class KQueueIOLoop:
    # other methods...
    
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current is True:  # Check for True explicitly
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if an IOLoop instance already exists
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
