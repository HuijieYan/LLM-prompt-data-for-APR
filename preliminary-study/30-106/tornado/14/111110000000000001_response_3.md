The potential error in the `initialize` function is the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`. This condition is checking if there is no current `IOLoop` instance, and then it calls `self.make_current()`. However, if `make_current` argument is provided and is True, it should raise an error if a current `IOLoop` already exists.

The current bug occurs because the conditional checks are not correctly handling the case when `make_current` is provided and is True. It should raise an error if a current `IOLoop` already exists, but the code is only checking if there is no current `IOLoop` instance and then calling `self.make_current()`.

To fix this bug, the `make_current` argument should be handled properly, and the condition should be updated to check for a current `IOLoop` instance before trying to make it the current `IOLoop`.

Corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
