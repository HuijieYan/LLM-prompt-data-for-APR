The `test_force_current` test function creates an instance of `IOLoop` with `make_current=True`. Then it checks if the current `IOLoop` is the one that was just created, and it should raise a `RuntimeError` when trying to create a second instance with `make_current=True`.

The potential error in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is that when `make_current` is `True`, it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`, and if so, it raises a `RuntimeError`. This behavior is incorrect because the test case is trying to force the `IOLoop` instance to become the current one.

To fix this issue, the `initialize` function should check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and then raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is set to `True`.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is None and current_instance is None:
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected code, the function checks if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, in which case it raises a `RuntimeError`. If `make_current` is `None` and there is no current instance, the new `IOLoop` will become the current one.
