Potential error location: In the initialize method, specifically in the if statement checking if make_current is None.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because if make_current is None, it checks if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None and then calls self.make_current(). However, if make_current is None, calling self.make_current() will result in an error, as self.make_current is a method that should be called using self. 

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. If make_current is None, directly call self.make_current() without checking if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None.
2. If make_current is None, initialize a new IOLoop instance.

Corrected code for the initialize method:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
