The test case "test_force_current" is trying to create a new IOLoop instance with the "make_current" flag set to True. The test then checks if the newly created IOLoop instance is set as the current instance and also ensures that a second attempt to create a new current instance fails.

The error occurs because the "initialize" function in the "IOLoop" class does not handle the case where a current IOLoop instance already exists when "make_current" is set to True.

The bug occurs because the "initialize" function does not consider the case where there is already a current IOLoop instance when "make_current" is set to True. It should raise an error in this situation rather than trying to make the new instance the current one.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the "initialize" function to check if a current IOLoop instance exists when "make_current" is set to True and raise an error if it does. Here's the corrected code for the "initialize" function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected code, the "initialize" function will correctly check if a current IOLoop instance exists when "make_current" is set to True and will raise an error if it does, addressing the bug in the original code.
