The test case is trying to initialize an `IOLoop` with `make_current=True`. The `IOLoop` class has an `initialize` method that takes `make_current` as an argument and should handle the logic of setting the current IOLoop.

The potential error location within the `initialize` method is in the `elif make_current` block where it raises a `RuntimeError` if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None.

The bug occurred because the logic in the `initialize` method is not correctly handling the case when `make_current` is True.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `initialize` method to correctly handle the logic of setting the current IOLoop based on the value of `make_current`.

Here is the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected code, we first store the current instance of IOLoop in the `current_instance` variable. Then we check the value of `make_current` and handle the logic accordingly. If `make_current` is None, we check if there is no current instance and make the current IOLoop. If `make_current` is True, we check if the current instance already exists and raise a `RuntimeError` if it does, otherwise we make the current IOLoop.
