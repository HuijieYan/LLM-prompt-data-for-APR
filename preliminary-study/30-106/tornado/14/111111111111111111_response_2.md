The error occurs because the `make_current` argument is not handled correctly in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The current logic checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` before calling `self.make_current()`, but it does not consider the case where `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`, which should always make the current `IOLoop` instance.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` method to handle the `make_current` argument properly. 

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to modify the `initialize` method to always call `self.make_current()` when `make_current` is set to `True`, without checking if an IOLoop instance is already current.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

With this fix, the `initialize` method will always call `self.make_current()` when `make_current` is set to `True`, ensuring that the current `IOLoop` instance is correctly updated.

This fix addresses the issue where the original code raised a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` was set to `True`, even if there was no current `IOLoop` instance. Now, the method will handle both cases correctly.
