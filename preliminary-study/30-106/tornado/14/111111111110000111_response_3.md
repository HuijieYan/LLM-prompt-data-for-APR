The test case attempts to create an IOLoop with make_current set to True, which means it should try to become the current IOLoop. However, the test case fails with a RuntimeError indicating that the current IOLoop already exists.

The potential error location is in the initialize method of the IOLoop class, specifically in the handling of the make_current argument.

The bug occurs because the make_current argument is not being handled properly. When make_current is True, the code checks if there is already a current IOLoop and then raises an error if so. However, in this case, the code should actually check if there is no current IOLoop and then try to make the new IOLoop current. 

One approach to fixing the bug is to modify the logic inside the initialize method to correctly check if there is no current IOLoop when make_current is True, and only then make the new IOLoop current. If there is already a current IOLoop and make_current is True, then an error should be raised.

Here's the corrected code for the initialize method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected logic, the code will first check if there is no current IOLoop when make_current is true, and only then try to make the new IOLoop current. If there is already a current IOLoop and make_current is true, an error will be raised.
