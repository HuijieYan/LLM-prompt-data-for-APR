The potential error in the provided code is the use of "self.make_current()" without defining the "make_current()" method within the class.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the "make_current()" method is being called on the class instance without being defined.

To fix the bug, we can modify the code as follows:

```python
# corrected initialize method
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current_instance()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current_instance()

# defining the make_current_instance method
def make_current_instance(self):
    # add the logic for making the current instance here
    pass
```

In the corrected code, the "make_current_instance()" method is defined separately and called within the "initialize" method. The check for an existing IOLoop instance is also corrected to ensure that the logic works as intended.
