The test case `test_force_current` is trying to create a new instance of `IOLoop` with `make_current=True`. It then checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is the same as the newly created one, and also ensures that trying to create a second `IOLoop` with `make_current=True` should raise a `RuntimeError`.

The error occurs in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class, specifically in the `initialize` function defined by the `IOLoop` class. The error is raised when `make_current` is set to `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None`, indicating that an `IOLoop` instance already exists.

The bug occurs because the logic in the `initialize` method is not correctly checking if an `IOLoop` instance already exists.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` method to correctly handle the `make_current` argument and properly check if an `IOLoop` instance already exists.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialze` method of the `IOLoop` class:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the `initialize` method will now properly handle the `make_current` argument and ensure that an error is only raised if the current `IOLoop` instance exists and `make_current` is set to `True`.
