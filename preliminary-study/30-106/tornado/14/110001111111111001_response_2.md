The test case `test_force_current` is trying to create an instance of `IOLoop` with the argument `make_current=True`. The expected behavior is to create a new instance of `IOLoop` and set it as the current instance, and if `make_current` is already set to `True`, it should raise a `RuntimeError`. However, the test case is failing with a `RuntimeError` indicating that a current `IOLoop` already exists.

The potential error location within the `initialize` function is the conditional statement `if make_current is None` and the subsequent `if make_current` block. It seems that the logic to check if a current `IOLoop` exists or not is incomplete.

The bug occurs because the `initialize` function does not properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`. It incorrectly checks if a current `IOLoop` doesn't exist; however, it should check if a current `IOLoop` already exists when trying to force a new one.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic within the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is None and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        self.make_current()
```

By modifying the conditional statements and adding the correct checks for the existence of a current `IOLoop`, the bug can be fixed.
