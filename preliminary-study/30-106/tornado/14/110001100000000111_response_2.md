Potential error location:
The issue seems to be with the check for `None` in the `initialize` function. The code is checking if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` and then raising a `RuntimeError` if it is `None`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The initialize function is checking if the current IOLoop instance exists, and if not, it is trying to create a new one. However, the logic for checking whether the IOLoop instance exists or not is incorrect.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
The if condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is checking if the current IOLoop instance is `None`, but the intention is to check if it already exists. This can be fixed by using `if make_current is not None` instead of `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` to check if the IOLoop instance has been initialized.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
# relative function's signature in this file
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is not None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
