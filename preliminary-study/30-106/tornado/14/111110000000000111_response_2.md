The bug is located in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The bug occurs because when `make_current` is not provided, the code checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` and then attempts to make the current instance. However, when `make_current` is True and the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`, it raises a `RuntimeError` even though the condition should have triggered the `make_current()` call.

To fix this bug, we can simply remove the `elif` condition and always use the `make_current()` method if `make_current` is None or True. This will ensure that the current `IOLoop` instance is made if it doesn't exist, and avoid the redundant check for `None`.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

With this correction, the code will properly handle the case when `make_current` is None or True, and only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is explicitly set to False.
