The error occurs in the `initialize` method of the `KQueueIOLoop` class. The test creates an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, which should call the `initialize` method. 

The bug is the result of a logical error in the `initialize` method. When `make_current` is True, it should check if the current IOLoop already exists and raise a `RuntimeError` if it does. However, the current implementation doesn't check if the current IOLoop exists before attempting to create a new one.

To fix the issue, we need to modify the `initialize` method to properly handle the `make_current` parameter and ensure that it correctly checks for the presence of an existing IOLoop before attempting to create a new one.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this fix, the `initialize` method properly checks for the presence of an existing IOLoop instance before attempting to create a new one, and raises a `RuntimeError` if a current IOLoop already exists when `make_current` is True.
