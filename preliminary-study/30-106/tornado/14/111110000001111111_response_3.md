The error is occurring in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class. The issue arises because the `initialize` function is checking if the current IOLoop instance exists, and based on that, it either sets the current IOLoop or raises an error. However, it is not handling the case where `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop instance already exists.

The `initialize` function should be modified to handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop instance already exists. Instead of immediately trying to make the current IOLoop, it should first check if the current instance already exists.

The corrected code for the `initialize` function is as follows:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
```
