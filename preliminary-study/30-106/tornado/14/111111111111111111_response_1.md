The error occurs because the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class attempts to check if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists using the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` call. This call always returns `None` since the `instance` parameter is set to `False`, so the conditional statement `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is always true. As a result, the `make_current` parameter is ignored, and the function proceeds to raise a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists" even when no current `IOLoop` instance truly exists.

To fix this issue, the `initialize` method should use the `make_current` parameter directly to determine whether to make the current `IOLoop` instance.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        make_current = True
    if make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    if make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected code:
- If `make_current` is not provided, it defaults to `True`.
- If `make_current` is `True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists, a `RuntimeError` will be raised.
- If `make_current` is `True`, the current instance will be set as the current `IOLoop`.

This approach ensures that the `make_current` parameter is used correctly to determine whether to make the current `IOLoop` instance.

By making these adjustments, the issue with the initial code should be resolved, and the `initialize` method will function as intended.
