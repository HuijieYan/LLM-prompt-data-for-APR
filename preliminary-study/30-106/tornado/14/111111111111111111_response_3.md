The test case `test_force_current` tries to initialize a new instance of `IOLoop` with `make_current=True` and then asserts that the new instance is the current instance using `IOLoop.current()`. It also checks whether a second instance with `make_current=True` can be created, which should raise a `RuntimeError`.

The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError` is being raised when attempting to create a second instance with `make_current=True` because the current `IOLoop` already exists.

The potential error location within the `initialize` function is the conditional statement that raises the `RuntimeError`. 

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that when `make_current` is `True`, the code should check if the current `IOLoop` exists and then set the new instance as the current one. If the current `IOLoop` already exists, it should raise a `RuntimeError`.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function should be modified to correctly handle the condition where `make_current` is `True`. The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected code, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:` is used to check if the current `IOLoop` already exists when `make_current` is `True`. If it does, a `RuntimeError` is raised, and if it doesn't, the new instance is set as the current one using `self.make_current()`.
