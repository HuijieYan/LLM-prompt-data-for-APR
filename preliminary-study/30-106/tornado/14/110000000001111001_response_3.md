Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is in the line `self.make_current()` within the `if make_current` block. This line is trying to call a method on the `self` object, but it should actually be calling a method on the class itself.

Reasons Behind the Bug:
The bug is occurring because the method `make_current()` is being called on the `self` object, which is an instance of the class `KQueueIOLoop`, rather than on the class itself. This is leading to the `RuntimeError` being raised erroneously when `make_current` is `True`.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use the class name instead of `self` to call the `make_current()` method.
2. Check if the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` condition needs any adjustment.

Corrected Code:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.__class__.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.__class__.make_current()
```
