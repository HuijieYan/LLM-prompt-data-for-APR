The bug occurs in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The `initialize` method takes an argument `make_current` which defaults to `None`. If `make_current` is not provided, it checks if there is a current `IOLoop` instance. If not, it calls the `make_current` method to set the current `IOLoop`. If `make_current` is provided and is `True`, it also checks if there is a current `IOLoop` instance and raises a `RuntimeError` if there is.

In the test function `test_force_current`, it initializes a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and then tries to initialize another instance with `make_current=True`. This results in the `RuntimeError` being raised, indicating that the current `IOLoop` already exists.

The bug occurs because the logic to check if a current `IOLoop` instance exists is flawed. It always tries to make the current `IOLoop` instance if `make_current` is `None`, even if there is already a current instance. Additionally, when `make_current` is provided and is `True`, it also tries to make the current `IOLoop` instance, which leads to the `RuntimeError` being raised.

To fix the bug, the logic for checking the current `IOLoop` instance needs to be updated. If `make_current` is not provided, it should only make the current instance if it does not already exist. If `make_current` is provided and is `True`, it should only try to make the current instance if it does not already exist.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

With this updated logic, the `initialize` method will only make the current `IOLoop` instance if it does not already exist, as expected.
