The test case `test_force_current` is trying to create an instance of `IOLoop` with `make_current` set to `True`. The expected behavior is that if there is no current IOLoop, a new one should be created and set as the current one. If there is already a current IOLoop and `make_current` is set to `True`, it should raise a `RuntimeError`.

The problem is in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class. The condition `if make_current is None` does not handle the case where `make_current` is `True`. So, even if `make_current` is `True`, it will not trigger the creation of a new IOLoop because it falls into the `None` case.

The fix for this bug is to modify the `initialize` function to handle the case where `make_current` is `True` separately.

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

After making this fix, the `initialize` function should correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`.
