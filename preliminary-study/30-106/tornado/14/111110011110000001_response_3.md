The test case calls the `IOLoop` class with the `make_current` parameter set to `True`. The `make_current` parameter is then checked within the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class, and based on its value, the method either sets the current IOLoop or raises a `RuntimeError`.

The bug occurs when `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop already exists. In this case, the `initialize` method should not attempt to make the current IOLoop, but rather raise a `RuntimeError` as it is currently doing. The bug is likely in the section of the code where `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop already exists.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` method to properly handle the case where `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop already exists.

The fixed code for the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
In the fixed code, we first save the current instance of IOLoop in the `current_instance` variable. Then, we check the value of `make_current` and the existence of the current IOLoop. Depending on these conditions, we either make the current IOLoop or raise a `RuntimeError` if it already exists.
