The error occurs in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The problem is with the conditional checks for `make_current` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. 

The current logic uses `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` to check if a current `IOLoop` instance exists, and then it tries to create one based on the value of `make_current`. However, there is a mismatch in the logic, and an error is raised even if a current `IOLoop` instance exists.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the conditional checks in the `initialize` method so that the code appropriately handles the existing `IOLoop` instance and the value of `make_current`.


Here's the corrected `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if self.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

In this corrected code, we use `self.current(instance=False)` instead of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` to check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance. Additionally, we modify the conditional check to only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

This fix ensures that the logic correctly handles the creation of a new current `IOLoop` instance based on the value of `make_current`.
