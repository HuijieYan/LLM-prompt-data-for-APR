The bug occurs because the `initialize` method is not handling the `make_current` parameter correctly. 

The `initialize` method is supposed to check if an IOLoop instance exists, and if not, make the current IOLoop. However, the logic is flawed when it comes to dealing with the `make_current` parameter.

In the provided test case, the value of `make_current` is `True`, which means the intention is to make the current IOLoop. However, the existing logic in the `initialize` method does not cater to this scenario properly.

To fix this bug, the `initialize` method can be modified to check if an IOLoop already exists and only make it current if it doesn't. If `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`, it should make the IOLoop current without checking for its existence.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
# corrected initialize method
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

With this corrected code, the `initialize` method should properly handle the `make_current` parameter and address the bug described in the provided test case.
