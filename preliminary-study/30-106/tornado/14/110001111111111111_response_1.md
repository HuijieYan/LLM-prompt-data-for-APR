The test case 'test_force_current' is trying to create an instance of 'IOLoop' with the 'make_current' parameter set to True. It then checks if the current IOLoop is the same as the one it just created. It should raise a RuntimeError when trying to create a second IOLoop with 'make_current' set to True.

The error message indicates that the RuntimeError is being raised due to the current IOLoop already existing, even though it should not exist.

The potential error location within the 'initialize' method is in the conditional statements that check if 'IOLoop.current(instance=False)' is None. It seems like the condition to check the current IOLoop's existence is not correctly implemented.

The bug occurs because the logic in the 'initialize' method is incorrect. It should be checking if the current IOLoop does not exist, but the current code is checking if the IOLoop exists, and if it does, it raises a RuntimeError.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic in the 'initialize' method to check if the current IOLoop does not exist before trying to create a new one. If 'make_current' is set to True, it should throw a RuntimeError if the current IOLoop already exists.

Below is the corrected code for the 'initialize' method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected code, I have changed the logic to check if the current IOLoop is not None when 'make_current' is True. If it's not None, it raises a RuntimeError. This change aligns with the expected behavior described in the test case.
