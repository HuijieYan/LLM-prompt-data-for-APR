The test function `test_force_current` is trying to create an instance of `IOLoop` with `make_current=True` and then asserts that the created instance is the current instance. It then attempts to create another instance with `make_current=True` and expects it to raise a `RuntimeError` because the current instance already exists.

The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError` is raised when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, which is unexpected.

The issue is within the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. In the `initialize` method, the code checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, and if it is, it tries to make the current instance using `self.make_current()`. However, if `make_current=True`, it should raise a `RuntimeError` if a current IOLoop instance already exists. The issue is that the logic is not correctly handling the case when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None.

To fix this, the logic in the `initialize` method should be updated to properly handle the cases where `make_current` is None or True. When `make_current` is None, it should make the current instance if it does not already exist. When `make_current` is True, it should raise a `RuntimeError` if a current instance already exists.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        current = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if current is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        current = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if current is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` method checks if a current instance exists when `make_current` is None, and it raises a `RuntimeError` if a current instance already exists when `make_current` is True. This should resolve the issue reported in the test case.
