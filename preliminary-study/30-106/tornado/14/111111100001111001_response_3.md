The bug in the `initialize` method occurs in the conditional statement where it checks if `make_current` is `True`. If it is `True`, it then checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`, and if so, it raises a `RuntimeError` stating that the current `IOLoop` already exists.

The error occurs because the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` is always met because it explicitly sets the `instance` parameter to `False`. This condition should check if there is already a current instance of `IOLoop` with `instance` parameter set to `True` instead.

To fix the bug, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` needs to be changed to `if IOLoop.current() is None:` and the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` should be changed to `if IOLoop.current() is None:` in both the places it occurs.

Here is the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current() is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current() is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
