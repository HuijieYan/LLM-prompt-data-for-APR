The buggy function `initialize` is intended to initialize the `IOLoop` instance and make it the current `IOLoop` if `make_current` is set to `True` and there is not already a current `IOLoop` instance. However, the current implementation contains a logical error that prevents it from functioning as intended.

The error occurs on line 42:
```python
if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
```
This condition checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, and if not, it calls `self.make_current()`. However, it's not using the `IOLoop` instance associated with the `initialize` method, leading to the error.

To fix this issue, we need to update the condition to use the `self` instance instead of calling `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function will correctly initialize the `IOLoop` instance and make it the current instance based on the value of `make_current`.
