The issue occurs in the `initialize` method of the `KQueueIOLoop` class. In the given buggy function, the `initialize` method checks if the IOLoop is already current and if not, it tries to make it current. However, when `make_current` is True, it checks if the IOLoop is not None and then raises a RuntimeError if that's the case. This is contradictory to the original intention, as it should only raise the RuntimeError if the IOLoop is already current.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic inside the `initialize` method to only raise a RuntimeError if the IOLoop is already current and `make_current` is True. Additionally, we need to handle the case where `make_current` is None and IOLoop is not current.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the revised code, we first store the current IOLoop instance in the `current_ioloop` variable. Then, we check the value of `make_current`. If it is None, we check if the `current_ioloop` is None and make the IOLoop current if that's the case. If `make_current` is True, we check if the `current_ioloop` is not None and raise a RuntimeError if it is, otherwise, we make the IOLoop current.
