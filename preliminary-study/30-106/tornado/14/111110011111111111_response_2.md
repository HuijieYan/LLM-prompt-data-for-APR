The error occurs in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The issue is that it incorrectly checks for the existence of the current IOLoop instance before either making the current instance or raising an error.

The method is expected to initialize the IOLoop, and if `make_current` is set to `True`, it should ensure that the current IOLoop does not already exist. However, the current implementation is flawed, as it first checks if the current IOLoop does not exist, and then proceeds to raise an error if `make_current` is set to `True`.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `make_current` is `True` first, and then verify if the current IOLoop exists.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is not None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

In this corrected code, we first check if `make_current` is `True`, and then verify if the current IOLoop exists. If `make_current` is not `True` but not `None`, then we check if the current IOLoop does not exist before making it the current IOLoop.

This fixes the bug and ensures that the `initialize` method behaves as expected based on the inputs.
