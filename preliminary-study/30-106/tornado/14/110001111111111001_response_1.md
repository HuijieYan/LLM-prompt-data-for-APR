The error is likely occurring in the `initialize` method of the `KQueueIOLoop` class. The error message indicates that the `current IOLoop` already exists, which suggests that the logic for checking the current IOLoop's existence in the `initialize` method is flawed.

The buggy function initializes the `IOLoop` instance with the `make_current` parameter, which should set the current IOLoop instance. However, the logic for checking the existence of the current IOLoop instance and raising an error is flawed.

To fix the bug, the logic for checking the current IOLoop instance should be revised. The `make_current` parameter should be used to set the current IOLoop instance, and if it already exists, an error should be raised.

Below is the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is not None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        if make_current:
            IOLoop.current(instance=True)  # set the current IOLoop instance
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

By revising the logic in the `initialize` method, we ensure that the `make_current` parameter is used to set the current IOLoop instance, and if it already exists, an error is raised. This should resolve the issue with the buggy function.
