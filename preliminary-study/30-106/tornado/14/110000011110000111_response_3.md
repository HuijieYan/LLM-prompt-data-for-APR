The issue is occurring in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class where the `make_current` parameter is checked. The bug seems to be related to the condition checking when `make_current` is `True`.

The `initialize` method is supposed to initialize the IOLoop instance, and if `make_current` is `True`, it should set the current IOLoop instance. However, the current logic has some issues:

1. When `make_current` is `True`, it first checks if the current IOLoop instance is `None`, and if it is, it raises a `RuntimeError`, which seems to be contradictory.
2. It also checks if `make_current` is `None` but then sets the IOLoop to current, which is also not the expected behavior.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic of the `initialize` method as follows:

```python
class IOLoop:
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
        else:
            super(IOLoop, self).initialize()
```

In this corrected code:
- We first check if `make_current` is `True`, and if it is, we then check if the current IOLoop instance is not `None` before raising a `RuntimeError`.
- If `make_current` is not provided or `False`, we call the `initialize` method of the superclass without setting the IOLoop to current.

This should address the issue and allow the `initialize` method to work as intended.
