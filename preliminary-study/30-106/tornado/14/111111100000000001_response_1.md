The potential error in the `initialize` method is in the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`. This condition is checking if there is no current instance of the IOLoop, and if so, it calls `self.make_current()`. However, the `current` method is defined with a default argument `instance=True`, so `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` will always return an instance of the IOLoop.

To fix this, we should refactor the `initialize` method to not rely on the `current` method and directly check if `self` is already the current instance of the IOLoop.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current() is not self:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current() is not None and IOLoop.current() is not self:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected code, we've removed the check for the current instance of the IOLoop and directly checked if `self` is already the current instance or not. We've also added an additional condition to raise an error if the current IOLoop already exists and is not the current instance we want to make.
