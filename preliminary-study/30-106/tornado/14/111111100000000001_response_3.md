The potential error in the `initialize` function is with the `if` condition when checking if `make_current` is None. 

The reason behind the bug is that the function is trying to reference `make_current` without checking if it exists, which can potentially lead to a NameError if `make_current` is not defined.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to check if `make_current` is not None before making the function call.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if hasattr(self, 'make_current'):  # Check if make_current method exists
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
            else:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```
