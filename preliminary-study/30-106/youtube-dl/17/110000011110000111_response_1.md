The error message indicates that the function `cli_bool_option` is failing an assert statement, specifically the `assert isinstance(param, bool)` statement. The assert statement is checking if `param` is of type bool, and it is failing.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `param` variable is being assigned the value of `params.get(param)`, which means it will be either `True`, `False`, or `None` depending on the existence of the `param` key in the `params` dictionary. This causes the assert statement to fail, as `None` is not of type bool.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case when `param` is `None` and provide a valid default value as the function signature implies that `param` should be of type bool.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def cli_bool_option(params, command_option, param, true_value='true', false_value='false', separator=None):
    param = params.get(param)
    if param is None:  # Handle the case when param is None
        param = False  # Provide a default value, assuming the absence of the param can be interpreted as False
    assert isinstance(param, bool)
    
    if separator:
        return [command_option + separator + (true_value if param else false_value)]
    return [command_option, true_value if param else false_value]
```

By providing a default value for the case when `param` is `None`, we are ensuring that it will always have a valid boolean value, hence fixing the bug.
