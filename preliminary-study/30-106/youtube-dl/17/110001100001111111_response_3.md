The buggy function `cli_bool_option` is supposed to take a dictionary `params` and a string `param` as input. It then checks if the value of `param` in `params` is a boolean and returns a list based on that check. If `separator` is provided, it concatenates `command_option` with the appropriate value based on the boolean value of `param`. If `separator` is not provided, it simply returns `command_option` and the appropriate value based on the boolean value of `param`.

The bug occurs because the function assumes that the value of `param` in `params` is always a boolean, which may not always be the case.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to first check if `param` exists in `params`. If it does, then we check if its value is a boolean. If it is, we proceed with the rest of the logic. If it's not, we can raise an error or handle the non-boolean value in a different way, based on the requirements.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
def cli_bool_option(params, command_option, param, true_value='true', false_value='false', separator=None):
    if param in params:
        if isinstance(params[param], bool):
            param = params[param]
            if separator:
                return [command_option + separator + (true_value if param else false_value)]
            return [command_option, true_value if param else false_value]
        else:
            # Handle non-boolean value in params[param]
            # For example, raise an error or handle it according to requirements
            pass
    else:
        # Handle the case where param does not exist in params
        pass
```
In the corrected function, we first check if `param` exists in `params`. If it does, we then check if its value is a boolean. If it is, we proceed with the rest of the logic as before. If it's not a boolean, we can handle it according to the specific requirements. If `param` does not exist in `params`, we can also handle this case according to the specific requirements.
