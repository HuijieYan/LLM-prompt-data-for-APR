The test case is checking the output of the `cli_bool_option` function against the expected output. The function is supposed to take a dictionary of parameters, a command option, and a parameter, and return a list representing the command line equivalent of the boolean parameter.

The potential error location in the problematic function is the `assert isinstance(param, bool)` line. This assertion assumes that the parameter retrieved from the dictionary is always a boolean, which might not be true.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function assumes the parameter retrieved from the dictionary is always a boolean, but in some cases, it might not be present in the dictionary at all.

To fix the bug, we can add a check to see if the parameter is present in the dictionary before trying to retrieve it. If it's not present, we'll assume it's False. Additionally, we should handle the special case where the `separator` is set, and the output should be a single string instead of a list.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def cli_bool_option(params, command_option, param, true_value='true', false_value='false', separator=None):
    if param in params:
        param = params[param]
    else:
        param = False

    if separator:
        return [command_option + separator + (true_value if param else false_value)]
    else:
        return [command_option, true_value if param else false_value]
```

This code checks if the parameter is present in the `params` dictionary. If it is, it uses the value from the dictionary; otherwise, it assumes the value is False. Additionally, it correctly handles the case when the `separator` is set.
