The potential error location within the problematic function is the assert statement `assert isinstance(param, bool)`. This line of code assumes that the `param` variable is always a boolean, which may not be the case in all situations.

The bug occurs because the function tries to check if the `param` variable is a boolean using the `isinstance` assertion, but it does not handle cases where the `param` variable is not a boolean. This can lead to assertion errors and unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we can remove the `assert` statement and instead handle the cases where the `param` variable is not a boolean. We can use the `bool()` function to convert the `param` variable to a boolean value, and then use conditional logic to construct the return value based on the `separator` parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def cli_bool_option(params, command_option, param, true_value='true', false_value='false', separator=None):
    param = params.get(param)
    param = bool(param)
    if separator:
        return [command_option + separator + (true_value if param else false_value)]
    return [command_option, true_value if param else false_value]
```

With this corrected code, we handle the case where the `param` variable is not a boolean by converting it to a boolean using `bool()`. This ensures that the function will not raise an assertion error and will return the expected result in all cases.
