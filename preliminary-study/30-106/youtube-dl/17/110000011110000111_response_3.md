The test case `test_cli_bool_option` includes several assertions that call the `cli_bool_option` function with different sets of parameters and checks if the returned output matches the expected output. The error message indicates that the `assert isinstance(param, bool)` statement within the `cli_bool_option` function is failing when `param` is `None`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `assert isinstance(param, bool)` line. This line assumes that `param` will always have a boolean value, but when `param` is `None`, this assumption fails.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function does not handle the case where the `param` value is `None` before checking its type. The function should first check for the existence of `param` and then verify its type.

To fix the bug, we can add a condition to check if the `param` value is `None` before asserting its type. If `param` is `None`, we can return an empty list or handle it according to the specific requirements of the function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def cli_bool_option(params, command_option, param, true_value='true', false_value='false', separator=None):
    param = params.get(param)
    if param is not None:
        assert isinstance(param, bool)
    if separator:
        return [command_option + separator + (true_value if param else false_value)]
    return [command_option, true_value if param else false_value]
```

With this correction, the function first checks if `param` is not `None` before verifying its type. If `param` is `None`, it does not check its type and handles it accordingly. This should resolve the assertion error and fix the bug.
