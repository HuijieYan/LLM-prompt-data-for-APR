The error is occurring because the `param` variable is being checked for type `bool` using the `isinstance` function. However, in the buggy code, `param` is actually the value retrieved from the `params` dictionary using the `param` variable, which is a string. This results in the `isinstance` check failing and raising an `AssertionError`.

To fix this bug, the `param` variable should be used to retrieve the value from the `params` dictionary and then checked for its truthiness (which effectively checks for boolean value).

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def cli_bool_option(params, command_option, param, true_value='true', false_value='false', separator=None):
    param_value = params.get(param)
    if param_value is not None:
        if separator:
            return [command_option + separator + (true_value if param_value else false_value)]
        return [command_option, true_value if param_value else false_value]
    return []
```

By making these changes, the function will correctly retrieve the value for the param from the params dictionary and then perform the truthiness check, which will resolve the `AssertionError` seen in the test.
