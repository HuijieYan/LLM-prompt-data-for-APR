Potential error location: The potential error in the buggy function lies in the line `assert isinstance(param, bool)`. This line checks if the value of `param` is a boolean type, which is not necessary since we are already getting `param` from the dictionary `params` and assuming it to be a boolean type.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The `assert isinstance(param, bool)` line is causing the function to throw an error for input types that are not explicitly boolean. This assertion is unnecessary and restricts the usage of the function to only boolean values.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Remove the line `assert isinstance(param, bool)` and perform the check for the existence of `param` in the `params` dictionary. Then, based on the value of `param`, construct the return value accordingly.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def cli_bool_option(params, command_option, param, true_value='true', false_value='false', separator=None):
    if param in params:
        value = params[param]
        if separator:
            return [command_option + separator + (true_value if value else false_value)]
        return [command_option, true_value if value else false_value]
    else:
        return []
```
