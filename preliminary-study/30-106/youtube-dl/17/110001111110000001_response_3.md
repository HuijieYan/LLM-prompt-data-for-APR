Potential Error Location: The error occurs because the function assumes that the 'param' key is present in the 'params' dictionary, but in the last test case, it's not present, causing 'param' to be None and further leading to the assertion error.

Reasons Behind the Bug: The buggy function does not handle the case where the 'param' key is not present in the 'params' dictionary. As a result, it assumes 'param' to be a boolean value, leading to the assertion error.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the 'param' key is present in the dictionary before attempting to access its value.
2. Provide a default value for the 'param' key if it's not present in the dictionary.
3. Perform additional validation to ensure that 'param' is actually a boolean value before the assertion.

Corrected Code:
```python
def cli_bool_option(params, command_option, param, true_value='true', false_value='false', separator=None):
    if param in params:
        param = params[param]
        if isinstance(param, bool):
            if separator:
                return [command_option + separator + (true_value if param else false_value)]
            return [command_option, true_value if param else false_value]
        else:
            # Handle the case where param is not a boolean
            raise ValueError("Parameter is not a boolean")
    else:
        # Handle the case where the param key is not present in the dictionary
        return []
```
