The bug is occurring in the `cli_bool_option` function where there is an assertion error because it's expecting the `param` to be a boolean type. However, the function is not handling cases where the `param` is not present in the `params` dictionary, which results in it being `None`. This is causing the assertion error.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where the `param` is not present in the `params` dictionary. We should also consider the case when `separator` is provided and modify the return value accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `cli_bool_option` function:

```python
def cli_bool_option(params, command_option, param, true_value='true', false_value='false', separator=None):
    param = params.get(param)
    if param is not None:
        if separator:
            return [command_option + separator + (true_value if param else false_value)]
        return [command_option, true_value if param else false_value]
    return []
```

This correction checks if the `param` is present in the `params` dictionary and handles the case where it's not present to avoid the assertion error. This should fix the bug and allow the function to work as expected.
