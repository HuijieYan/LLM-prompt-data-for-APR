The error message indicates that the `param` variable is `None`, which causes the assertion error when the `cli_bool_option` function tries to validate its type as a boolean.

Upon analyzing the test cases, it is clear that the `cli_bool_option` function is not handling the case when the `param` is not present in the `params` dictionary. This results in `param` being `None`, leading to the assertion error later in the function.

To fix this bug, the `cli_bool_option` function needs to handle the case when `param` is not present in the `params` dictionary. One approach to fix this would be to provide a default value for `param` in case it is not present in the dictionary.

Here is the corrected code for the `cli_bool_option` function:

```python
def cli_bool_option(params, command_option, param, true_value='true', false_value='false', separator=None):
    param = params.get(param, False)  # Provide a default value of False if param is not present
    assert isinstance(param, bool)
    if separator:
        return [command_option + separator + (true_value if param else false_value)]
    return [command_option, true_value if param else false_value]
```

By providing a default value of `False` when `param` is not present in the dictionary, we can ensure that the `param` variable always has a boolean value before the assertion statement. This should resolve the error encountered in the test cases.
