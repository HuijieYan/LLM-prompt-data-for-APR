The error message indicates that the function is trying to convert a number into a Unicode character using the `unichr()` function, but the number is not within the valid Unicode range.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `return compat_chr(int(numstr, base))` line. It's attempting to convert a number into a Unicode character, but the number is not within the valid Unicode range.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not handling numbers that are outside the valid Unicode range. The `unichr()` function in Python 2 is limited to the range from 0 to 0x10FFFF.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the number is within the valid Unicode range before converting it to a Unicode character.
2. If the number is outside the valid range, handle it according to the specific requirements of the application.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re
import unicodedata

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        num = int(numstr, base)
        if 0 <= num <= 0x10FFFF:
            return unicodedata.normalize('NFC', chr(num))
        else:
            # Handle the out-of-range number according to the specific requirements
            return ''

    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```

In the corrected code, we check if the number is within the valid Unicode range (0 to 0x10FFFF) before converting it to a Unicode character. If the number is outside the valid range, we handle it according to the specific requirements of the application.
