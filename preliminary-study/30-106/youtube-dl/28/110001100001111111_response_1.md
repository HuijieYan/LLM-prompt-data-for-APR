Potential Error Location:
The error seems to be occurring within the "_htmlentity_transform" function, specifically when attempting to use the "compat_chr" function to convert an integer to a Unicode string.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug seems to be related to trying to convert a large number (in this case, '#2013266066') to a Unicode string, causing a "ValueError: unichr() arg not in range(0x110000)".

Possible Approaches:
One possible approach to fixing this bug is to handle large numbers differently, for example by using Python 3's "chr" function, which can handle larger Unicode code points. Alternatively, it might be necessary to handle such cases as a special exception and provide a workaround.

Corrected Code:
```python
import sys

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10

        # Check if the number is too large for the system to handle
        if int(numstr, base) > sys.maxunicode:
            return 'NUM_TOO_LARGE'
        else:
            return compat_chr(int(numstr, base))

    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```
