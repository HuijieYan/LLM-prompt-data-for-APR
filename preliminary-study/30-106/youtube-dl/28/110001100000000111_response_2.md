The error occurs in the `_htmlentity_transform` function. The `compat_chr` function being called is using `unichr`, which is trying to create a character from a code point that is too large (outside the valid range) for the current Python build.

The issue is that the function is not handling large HTML entity values correctly, causing the `compat_chr` function to fail when trying to create a character from a code point that is outside the valid range.

To fix this, we should modify the function to handle large HTML entity values by using a conditional statement to check if the entity value is within the valid range. If it is, then we can use the `compat_chr` function to create the corresponding character. If it's not within the valid range, we should handle it appropriately, such as returning a placeholder value or raising an error.

Here's the corrected code for the `_htmlentity_transform` function:

```python
def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        code_point = int(numstr, base)
        if code_point <= 0x10FFFF:  # Valid range for unicode code points
            return compat_chr(code_point)
        else:
            # Handle out of range code points
            return '[INVALID CODE POINT]'

    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```
