Potential error location:
The issue seems to be with the `compat_html_entities` module, as it is referring to some variables and methods that are not defined within the provided function.

Reasons for the bug:
The code is attempting to use the `compat_html_entities` module without importing it or defining it within the function, leading to NameError.

Possible approach to fix the bug:
1. Import the required module `compat_html_entities` within the function.
2. Define the `compat_chr` function that is being used within the function.
3. Import the `re` module, as it is required for the regular expression matching.

Corrected code:

```python
import re
import html.entities

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
    compat_html_entities = html.entities
    def compat_chr(i):
        return chr(i)

    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        return compat_chr(int(numstr, base))

    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```
In the corrected code, I imported the `html.entities` module and assigned it to `compat_html_entities`. I also defined the `compat_chr` function to fix the reference error. Additionally, I imported the `re` module to fix the missing reference error for the regular expression matching.
