1. The error message indicates a ValueError raised when trying to convert a number to a character using the `chr()` function. The problematic input is '&#2013266066;', and the expected result is also '&#2013266066;'.

2. The potential error location is within the `_htmlentity_transform` function, specifically in the block that handles non-numeric HTML entities.

3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the value '&#2013266066;' is being treated as a numeric HTML entity, but it's beyond the Unicode range and cannot be represented as a character using the `chr()` function.

4. To fix the bug, we need to handle this specific case where the HTML entity refers to a numeric value that is outside the valid Unicode range. One approach could be to check the numeric value and return the entity literal representation if it's beyond the valid range.

5. Corrected code for the `_htmlentity_transform` function:

```python
def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        try:
            num = int(numstr, 16 if numstr.startswith('x') else 10)
            return chr(num) if 0 <= num <= 0x10FFFF else '&#{};'.format(num)
        except ValueError:
            return '&#{};'.format(numstr)

    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```
