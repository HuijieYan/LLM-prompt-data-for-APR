The error message is a ValueError that occurs when trying to retrieve the character representation of the HTML entity '&#2013266066;'. This error is occurring due to the chr() function being provided with a value that is out of the allowable Unicode range (0x110000).

The potential error location within the function is the section that handles numeric HTML entities. Specifically, the line `return compat_chr(int(numstr, base))` is likely causing the ValueError.

The reason behind this bug is that the function is attempting to convert HTML entities that represent Unicode code points that are not within the valid range of Unicode characters.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to handle this specific case by checking if the provided entity is within the valid Unicode range. If it is outside the range, we can return the HTML entity as it is, without attempting to convert it to a character.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        code_point = int(numstr, base)
        if code_point <= 0x10FFFF:  # Check if code point is within valid range
            return compat_chr(code_point)
        else:
            return '&#' + numstr + ';'  # Return the original entity if code point is out of range

    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```
