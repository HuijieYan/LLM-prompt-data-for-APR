The test case seems to be checking the unescaping of various HTML entities, such as '%20;', '&#x2F;', '&#47;', '&eacute;', and '&#2013266066;'. The error message indicates a ValueError occurring in the _htmlentity_transform function when trying to unescape '&#2013266066;', leading to the conclusion that the bug lies within the _htmlentity_transform function.

The bug occurs because the existing code is attempting to convert the HTML entity '&#2013266066;' to a character using the chr() function. However, the chr() function only supports Unicode code points from 0 to 1114111 (0x10FFFF in hex), so it is not capable of handling a large value like 2013266066. This results in the ValueError.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the _htmlentity_transform function to properly handle HTML entities that exceed the range supported by the chr() function. One approach could be to return the original HTML entity in these cases, as it is not representable as a character.

Here's the corrected code for the _htmlentity_transform function:

```python
import re

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        code_point = int(numstr, base)
        if code_point <= 1114111:
            return compat_chr(code_point)
    
    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```
In the corrected code, we first check if the code point extracted from the HTML entity is within the valid range (0 to 1114111) before attempting to convert it to a character. If it's within the valid range, we use the compat_chr function to convert it to a character. If it's outside the valid range, we return the original HTML entity.
