The problematic function, _htmlentity_transform, is meant to transform an HTML entity to a character. The function first checks if the entity is a known non-numeric HTML entity and returns its corresponding character if so. If the entity matches a numeric pattern, it uses regular expressions to extract the number and convert it to a character. If the entity is unknown, it returns its literal representation.

The bug is likely in the section that matches the numeric pattern, as the numstr is not always correctly converted to a character. This is likely due to the incorrect handling of the base when converting the number string to an integer.

To fix the bug, the base for converting the number string to an integer needs to be handled correctly.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import re

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = numstr[1:]  # remove the 'x'
        else:
            base = 10
        return compat_chr(int(numstr, base))

    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```
