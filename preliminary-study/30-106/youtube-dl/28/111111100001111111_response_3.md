The error occurs in the `_htmlentity_transform` function, specifically in the line `return compat_chr(int(numstr, base))`. The error message "ValueError: unichr() arg not in range(0x110000) (wide Python build)" indicates that the integer being passed to `unichr()` is out of range for the supported Unicode characters.

The reason for the bug is that the function is not handling large integer values correctly when converting them to Unicode characters.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle large integer values. One approach is to use the `unescape` function from the `html` module in Python, which can handle HTML entities and convert them to their corresponding characters. We can also update the function to handle large integer values by checking if the integer is within the valid Unicode range.

Here's the corrected code for the `_htmlentity_transform` function:

```python
import html

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
    return html.unescape(entity)
```

By using the `html.unescape` function, we can handle HTML entities and convert them to characters without encountering the ValueError for large integers.
