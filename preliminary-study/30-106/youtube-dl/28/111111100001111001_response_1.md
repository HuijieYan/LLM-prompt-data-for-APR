The potential error in the code is in the calculation of the `numstr` variable. The code checks if the number starts with 'x', and if it does, it adds a '0' in front of the number. However, this is unnecessary and leads to incorrect results.

The suggested approach for fixing the bug is to remove the code that adds '0' in front of the number if it starts with 'x', and instead directly convert `numstr` to an integer without modifying it.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            numstr = numstr[1:]  # Remove the 'x' from the beginning of the string
            base = 16
        else:
            base = 10
        return compat_chr(int(numstr, base))

    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```
