The error message indicates that there is an issue with the `compat_chr()` function, specifically in the `_htmlentity_transform()` method of the youtube-dl project. The error message "ValueError: unichr() arg not in range(0x110000) (wide Python build)" suggests that the argument passed to `compat_chr()` is not within the valid range.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line that calls `compat_chr()` after parsing the HTML entity.

The bug occurred because the `compat_chr()` function is used to convert a Unicode code point to a character, but in this case, the code point is not within the valid range.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to validate the Unicode code point before passing it to `compat_chr()`. If the code point is not within the valid Unicode range, we can handle it accordingly.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

# this is the corrected function
def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        code_point = int(numstr, base)
        
        # Validate the code point
        if 0 <= code_point <= 0x10FFFF:
            return compat_chr(code_point)
        else:
            return ''  # Handle code points that are out of range

    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```

In the corrected code, we added a validation step for the code point obtained from the HTML entity. If the code point is not within the valid Unicode range (0-0x10FFFF), we handle it accordingly.
