The test case 'test_unescape_html' is checking the functionality of the 'unescapeHTML' function. It is passing different types of HTML entities and checking whether the function correctly transforms them to their corresponding characters. The error message indicates that there is a ValueError in the 'unescapeHTML' function when the input entity is '&#2013266066;'. This error is likely related to the '_htmlentity_transform' function.

The error is occurring because the value of the entity '&#2013266066;' is beyond the valid Unicode code point range, which is from 0 to 0x10FFFF. The 'chr()' function used inside the '_htmlentity_transform' function expects its argument to be a valid Unicode code point, and it raises a ValueError when the code point is out of range.

To fix this issue, the '_htmlentity_transform' function should first check if the entity is within the valid range of Unicode code points and handle it accordingly. If the code point is within the valid range, the function should return the corresponding character. If not, it should handle the out-of-range entity separately, for example, by returning the entity itself as its literal representation.

Here's the corrected code for the '_htmlentity_transform' function:

```python
def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        code_point = int(numstr, base)
        if 0 <= code_point <= 0x10FFFF:
            return compat_chr(code_point)
        else:
            return entity

    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```

In the corrected code, 'code_point' is checked to be within the valid Unicode code point range before using it to generate the corresponding character. If the code point is out of range, the function returns the original entity as its literal representation. This fix ensures that the function handles all HTML entities correctly and prevents the ValueError caused by out-of-range code points.
