The error occurs in the `_htmlentity_transform` function and is specifically related to converting the HTML entities into their respective characters. The function seems to be handling the hexadecimal and decimal numeric HTML entities incorrectly, leading to a ValueError.

The bug occurs because the function is not correctly handling the entities of type `'#2013266066'` and potentially other large numeric entities. The issue is related to the `compat_chr` function or the way the numeric entity is being converted to a character.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_htmlentity_transform` function to handle large numeric entities properly. We can also ensure that the conversion of the numeric entities to characters is within the valid range.

Here's the corrected code for the `_htmlentity_transform` function:

```python
import re
import html.entities as compat_html_entities

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        base = 16 if numstr.startswith('x') else 10
        try:
            return chr(int(numstr, base))
        except ValueError:
            return ''

    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```

In the updated code, we are using the `chr` function instead of `compat_chr` for converting the numeric entities to characters. Additionally, we have added a `try-except` block to handle possible `ValueError` when converting large numeric entities and return an empty string in such cases. This should resolve the ValueError issue occurring for large numeric entities.
