The test function test_unescape_html contains multiple assertions for the unescapeHTML function, which is expected to transform HTML entities to their corresponding characters. The error message shows that the test case unescapeHTML('&#2013266066;') is failing, raising a ValueError: chr() arg not in range(0x110000). This error occurs because the value passed to the chr() function is outside the valid Unicode range.

The issue is likely located in the _htmlentity_transform function, specifically in the line return compat_chr(int(numstr, base)). This line is attempting to convert the numeric HTML entity to a character using the int() function and then passing the result to chr(). However, the value of numstr might be too large, leading to the ValueError.

To fix the bug, the _htmlentity_transform function should be modified to handle large numeric values by checking if the converted value is within the valid Unicode range. If it is not, an appropriate action should be taken, such as returning a placeholder or an error message.

Here's the corrected code for the _htmlentity_transform function:

```python
def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        try:
            num = int(numstr, base)
            if 0 <= num <= 0x10FFFF:
                return compat_chr(num)
            else:
                return ''  # Placeholder for out-of-range values
        except ValueError:
            return ''  # Placeholder for non-numeric values

    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```

In the corrected code, after converting the numeric value, a check is included to verify if it is within the valid Unicode range (0x0 - 0x10FFFF). If the value is out of range, a placeholder (in this case, an empty string) is returned. This prevents the ValueError from occurring and handles out-of-range values appropriately.
