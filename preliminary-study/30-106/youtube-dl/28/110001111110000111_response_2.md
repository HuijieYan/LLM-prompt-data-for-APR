According to the error message, the issue occurs in the `_htmlentity_transform` function at line 399. The error is due to the `ValueError: unichr() arg not in range(0x110000)`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `int` function is trying to convert a number that is not within the valid Unicode range.

To fix the bug, we can modify the code to handle the case when the number is not within the valid Unicode range. We can return a placeholder character in such cases.

Here's the corrected code for the `_htmlentity_transform` function:

```python
def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        try:
            return compat_chr(int(numstr, base))
        except ValueError:
            return '\uFFFD'  # Replace with placeholder character

    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```

In the corrected code, I added a `try...except` block to handle the case when the `int` conversion raises a `ValueError`. When this happens, I return the Unicode replacement character `\uFFFD` as a placeholder.
