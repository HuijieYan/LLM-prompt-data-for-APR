The test case "test_unescape_html" is comparing the output of the "unescapeHTML" function against expected values for different HTML entities. The error message indicates that there is a ValueError of "unichr() arg not in range(0x110000)" when processing the HTML entity "&#2013266066".

The potential error location within the problematic function is the "compat_chr(int(numstr, base))" line. This line tries to convert the numeric HTML entity to a character using the "compat_chr" function. The error occurs because the numeric value of "&#2013266066" is out of range for the "compat_chr" function.

The bug occurs because the original implementation does not handle numeric HTML entities that are too large, resulting in a ValueError when trying to convert them to characters.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the "_htmlentity_transform" function to handle large numeric HTML entities and address the out of range issue in the "compat_chr" function.

```python
import re
import html
import sys
from collections import namedtuple

# Define a namedtuple for compatibility with existing code
compat_html_entities = namedtuple('compat_html_entities', 'name2codepoint')
compat_html_entities.name2codepoint = html.entities.html5

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])
        
    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        num = int(numstr, 0)
        try:
            return compat_chr(num)
        except ValueError:
            return entity

    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```

In the corrected code:
- The "compat_chr(int(numstr, base))" line has been replaced with "try/except" block to handle the ValueError and return the original entity if the value is out of range.
- The "compat_html_entities" object has been defined to provide the mapping of HTML entities to their corresponding characters.
- The "compat_html_entities.name2codepoint" attribute is assigned the HTML entity to character mapping from the "html.entities.html5" module, ensuring compatibility with the existing code and providing a comprehensive set of HTML entity mappings.
