The error message "ValueError: unichr() arg not in range(0x110000) (wide Python build)" indicates that the `unichr()` function is receiving an argument that is out of range. This is likely caused by the `_htmlentity_transform` function, which is responsible for transforming an HTML entity to a character.

The bug occurs because the `compat_chr()` function seems to be used incorrectly or it might be returning an incorrect value, leading to the ValueError. The bug is triggered when the `int` value generated from `numstr` is outside the valid range for `unichr()`.

To fix this bug, you can update the `_htmlentity_transform` function to handle cases where the `compat_chr()` function returns a value that is out of range for `unichr()`. One approach to fixing this is to replace `compat_chr()` with `chr()`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        char_code = int(numstr, base)
        if char_code > 0x10FFFF:  # Check if the character code is out of range
            return ''
        return chr(char_code)

    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return '&%s;' % entity
```

In the corrected code, I replaced `compat_chr()` with the built-in `chr()` function, and also added a check to ensure that the character code is within the valid range before returning the character. This should prevent the ValueError and resolve the issue.
