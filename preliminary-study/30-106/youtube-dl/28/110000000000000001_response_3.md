The potential error in the given function is that it references `compat_html_entities` and `compat_chr` without these being defined in the function. Additionally, the `re` module is used for regular expressions but has not been imported.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the required modules and functions are not defined within the function. The function is trying to access variables and functions that are not in its scope.

To fix the bug, the `re` module needs to be imported at the beginning of the function, and the `compat_html_entities` and `compat_chr` variables should be passed as arguments to the function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def _htmlentity_transform(entity, compat_html_entities, compat_chr):
    """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        return compat_chr(int(numstr, base))

    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```

In this corrected code, the `re` module is imported, and the `compat_html_entities` and `compat_chr` variables are now passed as arguments to the function, allowing the function to access these variables and operate properly.
