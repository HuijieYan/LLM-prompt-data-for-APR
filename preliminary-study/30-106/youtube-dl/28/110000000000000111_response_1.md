The error message "ValueError: unichr() arg not in range(0x110000) (wide Python build)" indicates that the `unichr()` function is receiving a value that is not within the valid Unicode range.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `return compat_chr(int(numstr, base))`, where the `int` conversion is generating a value that is not within the valid Unicode range.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is attempting to convert HTML entities to characters, and in some cases, it is generating values that are not valid Unicode characters.

To fix the bug, a possible approach is to add a check to ensure that the converted values are within the valid Unicode range, and if they are not, handle those cases accordingly, for example by returning a default value or an error message.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        num = int(numstr, base)
        if num < 0 or num > 0x10FFFF:
            return ''  # Handle values outside the valid Unicode range
        return compat_chr(num)

    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```
