The error message "ValueError: unichr() arg not in range(0x110000) (wide Python build)" indicates that the unichr function is receiving an argument that is outside the valid range for Unicode characters.

The potential error location within the function is the line:
```python
return compat_chr(int(numstr, base))
```

This line attempts to convert the HTML entity into a character, but it is not handling cases where the entity corresponds to a code point that is outside the valid Unicode range.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function does not handle the case where the code point is outside the range of valid Unicode characters, leading to the ValueError.

One approach to fixing the bug is to handle the error condition when the code point is outside the valid range of Unicode characters. This can be done by checking if the code point is valid before attempting to convert it to a character.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        code_point = int(numstr, base)
        if 0x0 <= code_point <= sys.maxunicode:  # Check if the code point is in the valid Unicode range
            return compat_chr(code_point)
        else:
            # Handle the case where the code point is outside the valid range
            return ''  # Or any other appropriate action

    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```

In the corrected code, the function first checks if the code point is within the valid Unicode range before attempting to convert it to a character. If the code point is outside the valid range, the function can handle the error condition appropriately, for example, by returning an empty string or another suitable action.
