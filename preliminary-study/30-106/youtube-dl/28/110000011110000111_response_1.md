The error is occurring in the `unescapeHTML` function when it tries to unescape the HTML entity '&#2013266066;'. The error message indicates that the `chr()` function is receiving an argument that is out of its valid range. This suggests that the value being passed to `chr()` is not a valid Unicode code point.

The potential error location is in the `_htmlentity_transform` function, specifically in the block of code that handles numeric HTML entities. The error is likely due to the conversion of a numeric HTML entity to a character using the `compat_chr` function, which in turn uses the `chr()` function. 

The bug occurred because the `int(numstr, base)` value is greater than 0x110000 (the upper limit for Unicode code points) and outside of the valid range for the `chr()` function.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the numeric HTML entity is within the valid Unicode code point range.

Here's the corrected code for the `_htmlentity_transform` function:

```python
import re

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = numstr[1:]  # remove the leading 'x'
        else:
            base = 10
        codepoint = int(numstr, base)
        if 0 <= codepoint <= 0x10FFFF:  # Ensure the codepoint is within the valid range
            return compat_chr(codepoint)
        else:
            return '&#%s;' % numstr  # Return the original entity if the codepoint is out of range

    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```

With this corrected code, we ensure that the numeric HTML entity is within the valid Unicode code point range before converting it to a character. If the codepoint is out of range, we return the original entity to handle the exceptional case.
