The error message "ValueError: unichr() arg not in range(0x110000) (wide Python build)" suggests that the issue is likely related to attempting to convert a Unicode code point that is outside the valid range.

Upon reviewing the provided code, it appears that the issue may be related to the conversion of HTML entities to characters using the `unichr` function.

The bug occurs because older versions of Python (such as Python 2.x) have a smaller maximum Unicode code point limit of 0x10FFFF. However, the code is attempting to convert entities that result in code points greater than 0x10FFFF, leading to the ValueError.

To fix this bug, the code needs to be modified to handle converting HTML entities to characters using a method that supports the larger Unicode code point range.

Here's the corrected code for the `_htmlentity_transform` function:

```python
import html

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
    return html.unescape(entity)
```

By using the `html.unescape` function from the `html` module in the standard library, it will correctly handle the conversion of HTML entities to characters, including those with code points beyond 0x10FFFF. This approach addresses the bug and ensures that the code is compatible with the wider Unicode build.
