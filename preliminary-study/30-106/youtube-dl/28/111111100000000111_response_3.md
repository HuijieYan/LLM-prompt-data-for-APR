The error message "ValueError: unichr() arg not in range(0x110000) (wide Python build)" indicates that there is an issue with the unichr() function, which is used to convert a Unicode code point into a Unicode character.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line that uses the `compat_chr` function, which seems to be responsible for converting the numeric HTML entity into a character.

The bug occurs because the `compat_chr` function is attempting to convert a Unicode code point that is outside the valid Unicode range (0x110000). This could happen if the input HTML entity is not properly handled or if there is a discrepancy in the interpretation of the HTML entity.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that the input HTML entity is correctly parsed and converted into a valid Unicode character. This could involve checking the validity of the numeric HTML entity and handling it appropriately, possibly by replacing it with a valid character representation.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        codepoint = int(numstr, base)
        if codepoint < 0x110000:
            return compat_chr(codepoint)
        else:
            return ''  # Return an empty string for invalid code points

    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to ensure that the code point obtained from the numeric HTML entity is within the valid Unicode range (0x0 to 0x10FFFF). If it is outside this range, we return an empty string to indicate that the code point is invalid. This prevents the ValueError related to the unichr() function.
