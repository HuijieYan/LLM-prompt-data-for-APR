The potential error in the given buggy function is likely occurring in the construction of the HTTP request string `s`. The bug seems to be related to how the `Host` header is being constructed. It should be based on the parsed netloc/netlocation, instead of the hostname.

The bug occurs because the `hostname` attribute of the parsed result is not being used to populate the `Host` header in the HTTP request string. Instead, an empty string is being used.

To fix the bug, we need to replace the `to_bytes(parsed.hostname)` with `to_bytes(parsed.netloc)` in the construction of the `Host` header.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    netloc = parsed.netloc or parsed.hostname
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(netloc) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
