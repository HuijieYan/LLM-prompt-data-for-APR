Potential error location: The error could occur in the line where the `to_bytes` function is being used, as it is not a built-in Python function and might not be imported.

Reasons behind the bug: The `to_bytes` function is not a built-in Python function, and it seems to be a custom utility function that is not defined in the provided code. This will cause a NameError when the function is called.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Import the `to_bytes` function from the appropriate module.
2. Define the `to_bytes` function within the current module.

Corrected code:

```python
# fix the import for to_bytes
from some_module import to_bytes

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
