Potential error location:
The error is likely occurring in the `urlparse_cached` and `urlunparse` functions, as they are not defined within the provided code snippet.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The `urlparse_cached` and `urlunparse` functions are not defined within the provided code, so they need to be imported or implemented for the code to work properly. Additionally, the `to_bytes` function is not defined, so it also needs to be addressed.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
1. Import the necessary functions (e.g., `urlparse_cached` and `urlunparse`) from their respective modules.
2. Implement the `to_bytes` function if it is custom or not already provided by a library.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Assuming the necessary functions are imported from their respective modules
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request)  # Using urlparse instead of urlparse_cached
    path = urlunparse(('', '') + parsed[2:])  # Using urlunparse with necessary parameters
    s = request.method.encode('utf-8') + b" " + path.encode('utf-8') + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"  # Using encode() to convert strings to bytes
    s += b"Host: " + parsed.hostname.encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n"  # Using encode() to convert strings to bytes
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string().encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n"  # Using encode() to convert strings to bytes
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
