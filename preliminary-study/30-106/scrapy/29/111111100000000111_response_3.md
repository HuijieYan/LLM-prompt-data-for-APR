The potential error in the provided function is that the urlparse_cached and urlunparse functions are not defined within the function. This means that the function will raise a NameError when called because it cannot find these functions.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is trying to use the urlparse_cached and urlunparse functions, but they are not imported or defined within the function scope.

To fix the bug, we need to import the required functions from the appropriate module and ensure that they are available within the function scope.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from scrapy.utils.url import urlparse_cached, urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In this corrected code, we import the urlparse_cached and urlunparse functions from the appropriate module, so that they are available within the function scope. This should fix the bug and allow the function to work as intended.
