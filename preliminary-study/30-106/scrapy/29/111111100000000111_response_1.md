Potential error location: The error is most likely occurring in the line `s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"` as it is trying to concatenate `bytes` with the result of `to_string()`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because `to_string()` method is returning a string, and when trying to concatenate it with `bytes`, it's causing a type error.

Approaches for fixing the bug: To fix this bug, we need to ensure that any strings are encoded to bytes before concatenating them with other bytes.

Corrected code:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += to_bytes(request.headers.to_string()) + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
