The error message indicates a TypeError in the `to_bytes()` function, specifically when it is receiving a `NoneType` object instead of a unicode, str, or bytes object.

The potential error location within the `request_httprepr` function is the line `s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"`. The `parsed.hostname` seems to be None, causing the `to_bytes()` function to raise a TypeError.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `parsed.hostname` is not properly handled when it is None, leading to the `to_bytes()` function receiving a NoneType object and raising a TypeError as a result.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `parsed.hostname` is None and handle it properly to avoid passing a NoneType object to the `to_bytes()` function.

```python
from six.moves.urllib.parse import urlparse as urlparse_cached, urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected code, we added a check for `parsed.hostname` to ensure it's not None before attempting to concatenate it with the byte strings. This should prevent the TypeError from occurring.
