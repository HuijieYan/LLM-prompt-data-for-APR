The error seems to occur at line 82 of the `request_httprepr` function, where there is an attempt to concatenate the `hostname` attribute of the `parsed` object. The error message suggests that the `hostname` attribute is `None`, which causes an error when trying to convert it to bytes using the `to_bytes` function.

The reason for the bug is that the `hostname` attribute of the `parsed` object is None, which is not handled in the function.

To fix the bug, we can check if `parsed.hostname` is None, and if so, use the `netloc` attribute instead. Additionally, we can also handle the case where `parsed.path` is an empty string, which is the case for the 'file' scheme.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    if parsed.scheme == 'file':
        path = parsed.path or '/'
        netloc = ''  # For 'file' scheme, netloc should be empty
    else:
        path = parsed.path or '/'
        netloc = parsed.netloc

    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(netloc) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
``` 

With these changes, the function should handle the `file` scheme and `ftp` scheme properly, and it should not raise an error as indicated in the test.
