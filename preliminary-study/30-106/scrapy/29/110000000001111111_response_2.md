Potential error location: The issue most likely lies in the `urlparse_cached` and `urlunparse` functions. It seems that `urlparse_cached` is not properly parsing the URL, resulting in incorrect paths and hostnames being extracted.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug is caused by incorrect parsing of the URL, leading to the wrong path and hostname being used in the HTTP representation.

Approach for fixing the bug: Use Python's built-in `urllib.parse` module to properly parse and construct the URL components.

Corrected code:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request.uri)  # Using urlparse instead of urlparse_cached
    path = parsed.path or '/'  # Using parsed.path directly
    s = request.method.encode() + b" " + path.encode() + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + parsed.hostname.encode() + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected code, `urllib.parse.urlparse` is used to properly parse the URL, and `urlunparse` is removed as it's not necessary for generating the raw HTTP representation. The corrected code uses the parsed components directly and properly encodes string literals.
