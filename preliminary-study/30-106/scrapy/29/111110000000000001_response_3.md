Potential error location: 
The error is likely occurring on the line `path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))` as the `urlunparse` function is not defined.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The `urlunparse` function is not defined in the code snippet provided. It should be imported from the `urllib.parse` module in order to properly parse the URL.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Import the `urlunparse` function from the `urllib.parse` module to properly parse the URL.
2. Ensure that the parsed components of the URL are being concatenated and formatted correctly to generate the raw HTTP representation.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
