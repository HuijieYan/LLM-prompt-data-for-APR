The error occurs in the function `request_httprepr` on line 82, where it tries to concatenate the "Host" string with the parsed hostname using the `to_bytes` function, which throws a TypeError because the `parsed.hostname` is None.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where the parsed URL does not contain a hostname. This causes the `to_bytes` function to receive a NoneType, resulting in the TypeError.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the parsed URL contains a hostname before trying to use it in the `request_httprepr` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes
from scrapy.http.request import urlparse_cached, urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body if request.body else b""  # ensure request.body is not None
    return s
```

In this corrected code, we have added a check for `parsed.hostname` to ensure it's not None before trying to use it. Additionally, we added a check for `request.body` to ensure it's not None before concatenating it to the `s` string.
