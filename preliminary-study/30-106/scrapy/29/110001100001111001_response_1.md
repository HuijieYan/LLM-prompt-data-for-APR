The buggy function `request_httprepr` is supposed to return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request. Based on the provided test cases and the error in the code, it seems that the function is not handling the 'file' scheme properly.

The potential error location within the function is when constructing the 'Host' header. The code currently uses `parsed.hostname` to construct the 'Host' header, but for the 'file' scheme, `parsed.hostname` might be empty, leading to an incorrect 'Host' header.

The bug occurs because the code does not account for the 'file' scheme, which does not have a 'hostname'. As a result, it tries to use an empty string for the 'Host' header when it should not be included at all.

To fix the bug, the code should check for the 'file' scheme and handle it separately from other schemes.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    if parsed.scheme == 'file':
        host_header = b''
    else:
        host_header = b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += host_header
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
