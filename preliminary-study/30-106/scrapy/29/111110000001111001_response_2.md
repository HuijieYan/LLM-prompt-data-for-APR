The potential error location within the function is in the line `s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"`. This line concatenates the `parsed.hostname` value with the string "Host: " and a carriage return ('\r\n'). 

The bug occurs because when the `parsed.hostname` is empty, it does not add the actual hostname to the request. This will lead to incorrect requests being sent.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is empty. We can use the `netloc` attribute of the parsed URL to retrieve the hostname.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse as urlparse_cached, urlunparse
from twisted.web.http_headers import Headers
from twisted.python.compat import to_bytes

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    
    hostname = parsed.netloc  # Get the hostname from the netloc attribute

    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

By using `parsed.netloc` to get the hostname, the corrected code ensures that the actual hostname is included in the request, even if `parsed.hostname` is empty.
