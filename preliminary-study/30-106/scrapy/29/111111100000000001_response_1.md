The potential error in the given function is that it is trying to concatenate bytes and strings together, which would result in a TypeError. This is because the `to_bytes()` function is converting the input to bytes, but some parts of the code are already in bytes.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that all the strings are encoded to bytes before concatenating them in the `request_httprepr` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = request.method.encode('utf-8') + b" " + path.encode('utf-8') + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + parsed.hostname.encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string().encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In this corrected code, we have used the `encode()` method to convert the strings to bytes before concatenating them. This ensures that we are working with bytes throughout the function.
