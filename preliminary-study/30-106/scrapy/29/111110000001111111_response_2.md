The bug in the given function is that it incorrectly creates the HTTP request line by using the path from the URL as the path in the request, and it does not include the scheme in the HTTP request line.

The potential error location is in the concatenation of the 's' variable, where the path is not being constructed correctly.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not taking into account the scheme (e.g., http, https, ftp) in the URL when constructing the HTTP request line. Additionally, the 'Host' header is not being constructed correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the 's' variable to include the scheme and construct the 'Host' header properly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from twisted.web.http_headers import Headers

def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    scheme = parsed.scheme.encode('utf-8')
    host = parsed.netloc.split('@')[-1].encode('utf-8')
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + scheme + b"://" + host + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + host + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In this corrected code, we have added the scheme to the HTTP request line along with the host properly extracted from the parsed URL. We also encode the strings to bytes for concatenation. The 'Host' header is constructed using the host extracted from the parsed URL.
