Potential error location: 

The error is likely due to the `urlparse_cached` and `urlunparse` functions not being imported or defined in the code. These functions are necessary for parsing and constructing URLs but are not being used correctly or imported.

Reason behind the bug:

The `urlparse_cached` and `urlunparse` functions are not imported or defined in the code, leading to a NameError when trying to call these functions. 

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

1. Import the necessary functions if they already exist in a module.
2. Define the necessary functions if they don't already exist.

Corrected code:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = request.method.encode('utf-8') + b" " + path.encode('utf-8') + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + parsed.hostname.encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string().encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
