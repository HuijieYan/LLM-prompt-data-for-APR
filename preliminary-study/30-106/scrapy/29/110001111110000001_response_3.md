The error message indicates that the script is trying to convert a 'NoneType' object to bytes, which is causing a TypeError in the function 'to_bytes'. This occurs when the 'parsed.hostname' is None, and the function 'to_bytes' is unable to handle this NoneType object.

To fix this bug, we need to check if 'parsed.hostname' is None before trying to convert it to bytes. If it is None, we can replace it with an empty string or handle it in a way that won't cause an error when converting to bytes.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from six import string_types
from six.moves.urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse
from scrapy.http import Request

def to_bytes(text, encoding=None, errors='strict'):
    """Return the binary representation of `text`. If `text`
    is already a bytes object, return it as-is."""
    if isinstance(text, bytes):
        return text
    if not isinstance(text, string_types):
        raise TypeError('to_bytes must receive a unicode, str or bytes '
                        'object, got %s' % type(text).__name__)
    if encoding is None:
        encoding = 'utf-8'
    return text.encode(encoding, errors)

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname or '') + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With the corrected code, we check if 'parsed.hostname' is None, and if it is, we replace it with an empty string before converting it to bytes. This ensures that we don't encounter a TypeError when converting to bytes.
