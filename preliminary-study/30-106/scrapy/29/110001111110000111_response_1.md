The error message indicates a TypeError in the `to_bytes()` function on line 82 of the `request_httprepr` function. The error is caused by the fact that `parsed.hostname` is returning a `None` value, and the `to_bytes()` function is not handling this case properly.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `to_bytes()` function to handle the case when `text` is `None` and return an empty bytes object. This will prevent the TypeError from occurring.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes
from scrapy.http.request import Request  # assuming this import is correct

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) if parsed.hostname else b"" + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In this corrected code, we added a check for `parsed.hostname` to handle the case when it is `None`. If `parsed.hostname` is `None`, it will return an empty bytes object instead of raising a TypeError.
