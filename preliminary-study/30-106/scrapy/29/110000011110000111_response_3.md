The error message indicates that the `to_bytes` function is receiving a `NoneType` object, which it cannot handle. The issue is likely in the line `parsed.hostname`, where `parsed` might not have a `hostname` attribute, leading to `None`.

To fix this issue, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` might be `None`. We can achieve this by using the `getattr` function with a default value.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from six.moves.urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse
from scrapy.http.request import Request
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(getattr(parsed, 'hostname', '')) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected function, we replaced `urlparse_cached` with `urlparse` (since `urlparse_cached` is not defined) and used `getattr(parsed, 'hostname', '')` to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` might be `None`. This would prevent the `to_bytes` function from receiving a `NoneType` object and resolve the TypeError.
