The test case is trying to call the `request_httprepr` function with a request that has a non-HTTP URL (`file:///tmp/foo.txt` and `ftp://localhost/tmp/foo.txt`). The error message indicates that the `to_bytes` function is receiving a `NoneType` instead of the expected `str` or `bytes` object.

The potential error location within the `request_httprepr` function is the line that concatenates the "Host" header. This line is trying to convert the `parsed.hostname` to bytes using the `to_bytes` function.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `parsed.hostname` might be `None` when the URL is not an HTTP or HTTPS URL. This causes the `to_bytes` function to raise a `TypeError` when trying to convert `None` to bytes.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` before passing it to the `to_bytes` function. We can set a default value for the hostname in such cases.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
