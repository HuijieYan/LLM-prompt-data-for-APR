The potential error in the provided buggy function is in the line `s += b"\r\n" + request.body`. This is because the `request.body` might not always be present and can result in a TypeError when attempting to concatenate it to a byte string.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to first check if `request.body` exists before trying to concatenate it to the byte string.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    if request.body:
        s += b"\r\n" + request.body
    return s
```
