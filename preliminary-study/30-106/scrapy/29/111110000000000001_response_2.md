Potential error location: 
The issue in the given function is that the `urlparse_cached` and `urlunparse` functions are not defined. These functions appear to be custom or imported from a library that is not included in the code snippet.

Reasons behind the bug:
The `urlparse_cached` and `urlunparse` functions are not defined or imported in the provided code. This causes the NameError when these functions are used in the `request_httprepr` function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Import the required modules that contain the `urlparse_cached` and `urlunparse` functions.
2. If these functions are custom, ensure that they are defined within the code or in a separate module that is imported.

Corrected code:
```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse
import requests  # Assuming urlparse_cached is a custom function 

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
