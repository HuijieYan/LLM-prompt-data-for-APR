Potential error location: The error may be occurring in the `urlparse_cached` function, which is not provided in the source code. This function is used to parse the URL of the request.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug appears to be related to the incorrect parsing of the URL, specifically in how the hostname is being extracted and used in the `s` variable.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Instead of using `parsed.hostname`, we can use `parsed.netloc` to correctly extract the hostname from the parsed URL.

Corrected code:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes
from scrapy.http.request import Request

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.netloc) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected code, we use `parsed.netloc` to correctly extract the hostname from the parsed URL, fixing the bug. Additionally, we import the necessary functions and modules used in the function.
