Potential Error Location: 
The issue seems to be with the `urlparse_cached` and `urlunparse` functions, as well as the `to_bytes` function.

Reasons behind the Bug: 
The `urlparse_cached` and `urlunparse` functions are not defined in the provided code, which would cause an error. Additionally, the `to_bytes` function is also not defined, so it would also cause an error.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Import the necessary functions from the appropriate libraries (e.g., `from urllib.parse import urlparse as urlparse_cached, urlunparse`).
2. Define the `to_bytes` function if it is a custom function used for encoding strings to bytes.

Corrected Code:
```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse as urlparse_cached, urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled by Twisted).
    """
    path = urlparse_cached(request).path or '/'
    s = request.method.encode() + b" " + path.encode() + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + urlparse_cached(request).hostname.encode() + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string().encode() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
