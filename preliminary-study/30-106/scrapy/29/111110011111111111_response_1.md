Potential error location within the problematic function: The error seems to occur at the line `s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The `parsed.hostname` is being passed directly to the `to_bytes()` function, but in the case of a `'file://'` URI, the `parsed.hostname` is `None`. This causes the `to_bytes()` function to throw a `TypeError` as it does not handle `NoneType` inputs.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
We need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None`. This can be achieved by modifying the line `s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"` to:
```
if parsed.hostname:
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
```
This will only add the "Host" header if `parsed.hostname` is not `None`.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
# this is the corrected function
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
