The potential error in the function `request_httprepr` is the use of `urlparse_cached` and `urlunparse` functions. These functions are not imported or defined within the scope of the provided code.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the necessary functions for parsing and unparsing URLs are not available for use in the given code.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to import `urlparse` and `urlunparse` from the `urllib.parse` module, and then use them to parse and unpase the URL.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = request.method.encode('utf-8') + b" " + path.encode('utf-8') + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + parsed.hostname.encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
