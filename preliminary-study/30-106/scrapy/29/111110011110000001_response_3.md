Potential error location: The error is occurring at the line `s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"` in the `request_httprepr` function.

Reasons behind the bug: The `parsed.hostname` is resulting in a `None` value because the `urlparse_cached` method is not being called correctly, resulting in a `NoneType` error when trying to convert it to bytes.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the `parsed.hostname` is `None` before trying to convert it to bytes.
2. Ensure that the `urlparse_cached` method is being called correctly and returning the expected values.
3. Review the construction of the raw HTTP representation to ensure that all components are properly included.

Corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes
from scrapy.http import Request
from scrapy.utils.url import urlparse_cached, urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body if request.body else b""
    
    return s
```

In the corrected code:
1. The `urlparse_cached` method is called with `request.url` instead of just `request`, ensuring that the URL is properly parsed.
2. Checking if `parsed.hostname` is not `None` before adding it to the `s` string.
3. Proper conditions are added to handle cases where the `request.headers` or `request.body` might be empty.
