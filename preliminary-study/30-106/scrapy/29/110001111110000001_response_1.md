The error message indicates a TypeError in the `to_bytes` function within the `request_httprepr` function. The `to_bytes` function is being called on `parsed.hostname`, which seems to be returning a `NoneType`, causing the error.

The reason behind the bug is that the `parsed.hostname` is not being correctly parsed from the URL, leading to it being `None` and causing the `to_bytes` function to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where the `parsed.hostname` is `None`. This can be done by checking if `parsed.hostname` is `None` and providing a default value for the host if it is.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
from six.moves.urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse
from scrapy.http import Request
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname if parsed.hostname else 'localhost') + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this correction, the code now checks if `parsed.hostname` is `None` and provides a default value of 'localhost' in that case, preventing the TypeError from occurring.
