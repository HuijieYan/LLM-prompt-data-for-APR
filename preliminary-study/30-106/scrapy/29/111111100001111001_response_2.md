Potential error location: The error seems to be within the concatenation of the "Host" header in the s variable. The buggy code is not adding the parsed hostname to the "Host" header.

Reason for the bug: The parsed hostname is not being added to the "Host" header, causing the bug in the HTTP representation of the request.

Approach for fixing the bug: Include the parsed hostname in the "Host" header when building the s variable.

Corrected code:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
