Potential error location: 
The error lies in the line `s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"`. It seems to be incorrectly concatenating the request method with the path.

Reason for the bug:
The bug occurs because the URL scheme is not being considered when constructing the raw HTTP representation. This leads to incorrect concatenation of the request method and path.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use the parsed.scheme to include the URL scheme in the raw HTTP representation.
2. Use the parsed.netloc to include the network location in the raw HTTP representation.

Corrected code:

```python
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes
from scrapy.http import Headers
from scrapy.utils.url import urlparse_cached

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if parsed.scheme:
        s = to_bytes(parsed.scheme) + b"://" + s  # include scheme in the raw HTTP representation
    if parsed.netloc:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.netloc) + b"\r\n"  # include network location in the raw HTTP representation
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
