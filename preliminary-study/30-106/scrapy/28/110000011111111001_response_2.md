The error is likely occurring in the `request_seen` method of the `RFPDupeFilter` class, which is not provided in the buggy code. It seems that the `request_seen` method is not working as expected, leading to an assertion error in the test case.

The issue might be that the `request_seen` method is not correctly identifying whether a given request has been seen before. This could be due to the `fingerprints` set not being correctly updated with the fingerprints of the requests.

To fix the issue, the `request_seen` method should calculate the fingerprint of the request and check if it's in the `fingerprints` set. If it's not in the set, it should be added to the set.

Below is the corrected code for the `__init__` method as well as an example of how the `request_seen` method might work.

```python
import os
import logging

class RFPDupeFilter:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
            self.fingerprints = {x.strip() for x in self.file}  # update fingerprints set

    def request_seen(self, request):
        fp = request_fingerprint(request)  # calculate request fingerprint
        if fp in self.fingerprints:
            return True
        self.fingerprints.add(fp)  # add fingerprint to set
        return False
```

In this corrected code, the `request_seen` method uses the `request_fingerprint` function to calculate the fingerprint of the request and then checks if it's in the `fingerprints` set. If it's not in the set, it adds the fingerprint to the set and returns False, indicating that the request has not been seen before.
