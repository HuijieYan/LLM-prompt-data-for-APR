Potential error location: 
The issue could be with the opening of the file and reading its contents. 

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: 
The bug is occurring because the file is being opened in "a+" mode, which means it is opened for reading and appending. However, the contents of the file are being read and used to update the "fingerprints" set. 

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Open the file in "r" mode for reading only.
2. Check if the file exists before attempting to open it.

Corrected code:

```python
import os
import logging

class DupeFilters:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            if os.path.exists(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen')):
                with open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'r') as file:
                    self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in file)
            else:
                self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'w')

# Usage of the fixed function
# dupe_filters = DupeFilters('/path/to/directory', debug=True)
```
