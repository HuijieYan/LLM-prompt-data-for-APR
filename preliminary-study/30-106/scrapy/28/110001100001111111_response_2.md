The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the class `RFPDupeFilter`. This method is intended to initialize the instance variables of the class, including `self.file`, `self.fingerprints`, `self.logdupes`, `self.debug`, and `self.logger`.

The potential error in the function could be that the `path` parameter is used to open a file, but it does not handle the file properly. This could lead to potential resource leaks if the file is not closed properly. Additionally, there is a missing import statement for the `os` module, which is likely to cause a NameError when trying to call `os.path.join`.

To fix the bug, we can add a try-finally block to ensure that the file is closed properly, and we need to import the `os` module to use `os.path.join`.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
import logging
import os

class RFPDupeFilter:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            try:
                self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
                self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
            finally:
                if self.file:
                    self.file.close()
```

With these changes, we ensure that the file is properly closed, and we import the `os` module to use `os.path.join` for opening the file.
