The issue in the `__init__` method of the `RFPDupeFilter` class seems to be related to the `path` argument, which is used to open a file and update the `self.fingerprints` set with the contents of the file. However, the `fingerprints` set is not being updated correctly, leading to the failing test case.

The reason for this bug is that the file's cursor position is at the end (due to the 'a+' mode), so when reading the file, it starts at the end and doesn't read anything. This results in an empty set of fingerprints.

To fix this issue, the file cursor position needs to be set to the beginning of the file before reading its contents to update the `self.fingerprints` set.

Corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
class RFPDupeFilter(BaseDupeFilter):
    """
    Request Fingerprint duplicates filter
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            file_path = os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen')
            if os.path.exists(file_path):
                with open(file_path, 'r') as f:  # Open the file in read mode
                    self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in f)
            else:
                open(file_path, 'a').close()  # Create the file if it doesn't exist
                self.file = open(file_path, 'r+')
```

With these changes, the file cursor is set to the beginning while reading its contents to update the `self.fingerprints` set. This should fix the bug and address the failing test case.
