Potential error location: the line `self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)` is causing the issue because it tries to iterate over the file before reseting the cursor to the beginning of the file.

Reason for the bug: When the file is opened, the cursor is positioned at the end of the file. Therefore, the `self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)` line tries to iterate over the file contents but finds nothing to iterate over since the cursor is at the end of the file.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Reset the file cursor to the beginning before iterating over the file contents.
2. Use a different approach to read the file contents such as `self.fingerprints.update([x.rstrip() for x in self.file])`.

```python
def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
    self.file = None
    self.fingerprints = set()
    self.logdupes = True
    self.debug = debug
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    if path:
        self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
        self.file.seek(0)  # Reset file cursor to the beginning
        self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```
