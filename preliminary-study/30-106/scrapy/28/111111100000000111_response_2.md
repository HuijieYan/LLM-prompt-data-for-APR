Potential error location: 
The issue seems to be with the initialization of the `self.fingerprints` set. The code attempts to initialize the set with lines read from a file, but it does not handle the case when the file does not exist.

Reason behind the bug:
If the file does not exist, the code will throw an error when attempting to read from it, or it may fail to create the file if it is opened in write mode.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the file exists before attempting to read from it.
2. Handle the case where the file does not exist and create it if needed.
3. Use a try-except block to catch any potential file-related errors.

Corrected code:
```python
def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
    self.file = None
    self.fingerprints = set()
    self.logdupes = True
    self.debug = debug
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    if path:
        self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
        try:
            if os.path.exists(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen')):
                self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
            else:
                open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'w').close()
        except IOError:
            print("Error: Unable to read/write file.")
```
