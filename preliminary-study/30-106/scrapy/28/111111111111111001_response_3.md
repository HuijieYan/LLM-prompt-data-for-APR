The error message occurs during the assertion `assert df2.request_seen(r1)` in the `test_dupefilter_path` test function. This suggests that the `request_seen` method is not properly handling duplicate requests.

Upon reviewing the code, it is evident that the bug lies in the `__init__` method of the `RFPDupeFilter` class. The bug occurs because the `fingerprints` set is being updated with the `requests.seen` file content at the time of object initialization. However, this update only happens once, and subsequent changes to the `requests.seen` file are not reflected in the `fingerprints` set.

To fix this bug, the `__init__` method should be updated to read the `requests.seen` file content every time a new instance of `RFPDupeFilter` is created, ensuring that the `fingerprints` set is always up to date with the file content.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method of the `RFPDupeFilter` class:

```python
class RFPDupeFilter(BaseDupeFilter):
    """
    Request Fingerprint duplicates filter
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.path = path  # save path for later use
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        self._load_fingerprints_from_file()  # load fingerprints from file

    def _load_fingerprints_from_file(self):
        if self.path:
            try:
                with open(os.path.join(self.path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+') as file:
                    self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in file)
            except FileNotFoundError:
                pass  # File not found, fingerprints set will remain empty
```

In the corrected code, a new method `_load_fingerprints_from_file` is introduced to load the `requests.seen` file content and update the `fingerprints` set. This method is called from the `__init__` method. Additionally, the `self.path` attribute is saved for later use when reading the file. This ensures that the `fingerprints` set is updated every time a new instance is created, thereby fixing the bug.
