The potential error in the provided code is that the file is being opened in 'a+' mode, which means it is opened for reading and appending. However, the code later attempts to read from the file without first seeking to the beginning, which may lead to unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, we should seek to the beginning of the file after opening it, before reading its content.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
    self.file = None
    self.fingerprints = set()
    self.logdupes = True
    self.debug = debug
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    if path:
        self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
        self.file.seek(0)  # Move the file pointer to the beginning
        self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```

By adding `self.file.seek(0)` after opening the file, we ensure that the file pointer is positioned at the beginning of the file before reading its content.
