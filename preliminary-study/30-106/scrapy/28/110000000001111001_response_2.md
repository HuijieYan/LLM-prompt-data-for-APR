Potential Error Location:
The error may be related to the line `self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)`. This line attempts to update the fingerprints attribute with the contents of the file, but it is not handled properly.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the file is opened in 'a+' mode, which only allows appending to the file. In this case, the file pointer is already at the end of the file, so attempting to read from it will result in an empty result.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the following approach can be taken:
1. Open the file in read mode to read its contents.
2. Use a try-except block to handle any file operation exceptions and ensure that the file is closed properly.
3. Initialize fingerprints as an empty set and then update it with the file contents.

Corrected Code:
```python
import os
import logging

class YourClass:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            try:
                with open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'r') as file:
                    self.fingerprints = {x.rstrip() for x in file}
            except FileNotFoundError:
                # Handle the file not found exception
                pass
            except Exception as e:
                # Handle other exceptions and log them
                self.logger.error(f"An error occurred: {e}")
            finally:
                if file:
                    file.close()
```
This corrected code properly handles reading the file using a context manager to ensure that the file is closed after reading. It also initializes `self.fingerprints` as an empty set and then updates it with the file contents.
