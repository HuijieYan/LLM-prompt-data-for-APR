The given test case creates a temporary directory, instantiates an `RFPDupeFilter` object with that directory path, and performs various operations on it. The error occurs when checking if the second `RFPDupeFilter` object has seen the same request as the first one.

The potential error in the `__init__` function is with the line `self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)`. This line reads from the file object `self.file` and updates the `fingerprints` set. However, when the second `RFPDupeFilter` object is created, it does not read the file again. Therefore, it does not contain the data from the previous filter object, causing unexpected behavior.

The bug occurs because the `__init__` function does not re-initialize the `fingerprints` set for each new `RFPDupeFilter` object. Instead, it retains the fingerprints from the previous object, leading to unexpected behavior in subsequent operations.

To fix this bug, the `__init__` function should open and update the file for reading in the case where the file is not empty. This ensures that each new `RFPDupeFilter` object starts with a fresh set of fingerprints from the file.

Here is the corrected code for the `__init__` function in the `RFPDupeFilter` class:

```python
def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
    self.file = None
    self.logdupes = True
    self.debug = debug
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    if path:
        self.path = path
        filepath = os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen')
        if os.path.exists(filepath):
            with open(filepath, 'r') as f:
                self.fingerprints = {x.rstrip() for x in f}
        else:
            self.fingerprints = set()
```

By checking if the file exists and then reading its contents, the `__init__` function ensures that each new `RFPDupeFilter` object starts with the correct set of fingerprints.

This should resolve the bug and make the `RFPDupeFilter` class behave as expected.
