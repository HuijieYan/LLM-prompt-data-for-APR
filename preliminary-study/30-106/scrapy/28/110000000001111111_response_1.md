The potential error in the problematic function is the way the file is being read and stored in the `self.fingerprints` set. The function may not be correctly reading the file contents and updating the `self.fingerprints` set.

The bug occurs because the function is not properly handling the file read and the subsequent updates to the `self.fingerprints` set. It reads the file but does not properly update the set with the file contents.

To fix the bug, the function should read the file properly and update the set with its contents.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import logging
import os

# this is the corrected function
def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
    self.file = None
    self.fingerprints = set()
    self.logdupes = True
    self.debug = debug
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    if path:
        file_path = os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen')
        if os.path.exists(file_path):
            with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
                self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in file.readlines())
        self.file = open(file_path, 'a+')
```

In the corrected code, the file is checked if it exists, and then it is opened and its contents are read line by line and updated in the `self.fingerprints` set using the `update` method. This ensures that the file contents are properly read and updated in the set.
