The bug in the provided function is that when the file is opened, the lines are not being read and stored in the fingerprints set.

To fix this bug, the `__init__` function needs to read the lines from the file and store them in the `fingerprints` set.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# class declaration containing the fixed function
class RFPDupeFilter(BaseDupeFilter):
    """
    Request Fingerprint duplicates filter
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # this is the fixed function
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file.readlines())
```
