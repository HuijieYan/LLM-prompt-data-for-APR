The potential error in the given function is that the `open` function is used to open a file, but it is not being closed after its use, which can lead to resource leaks.

To fix this issue, it is necessary to ensure that the file is closed after being used to prevent resource leaks.

Corrected code:

```python
import logging
import os

class ExampleClass:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
        # Close the file
        if self.file:
            self.file.close()
```
