The error occurs when the second `RFPDupeFilter` object (`df2`) requests was seen according to the test function `test_dupefilter_path`. This suggests that the `request_seen` method in the `RFPDupeFilter` class is not functioning as expected. 

The bug is likely caused by the `__init__` method only updating the fingerprints from the file if the path is provided. If the file is empty or doesn't exist, the fingerprints remain empty, resulting in incorrect behavior when checking for duplicates.

To fix the bug, the `__init__` method should update the `self.fingerprints` set with the existing fingerprints from the file, regardless of whether the file is empty or not. This ensures that the `fingerprints` set always contains the existing fingerprints.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method of the `RFPDupeFilter` class:

```python
class RFPDupeFilter(BaseDupeFilter):
    """
    Request Fingerprint duplicates filter
    """

    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            try:
                with open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'r') as file:
                    self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in file)
            except FileNotFoundError:
                pass
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
```

By using a `try` statement and handling the `FileNotFoundError`, the code ensures that the `self.fingerprints` set is always updated with the existing fingerprints from the file, even if the file is empty or does not exist. This should resolve the bug and make the `request_seen` method work as intended.
