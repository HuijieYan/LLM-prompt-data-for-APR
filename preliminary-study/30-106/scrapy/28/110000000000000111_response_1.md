Potential error location: The `__init__` method should be inside a class, and the `logging` and `os` modules need to be imported.

Reasons behind the bug: The `__init__` method is not defined inside a class, and the required modules are not imported.

Approach for fixing the bug: 
- Define the `__init__` method inside a class and include the required imports for `logging` and `os`.
- Initialize the `file` attribute as `None`, and the `fingerprints` attribute as an empty set.
- Open the file if a path is provided and update the `fingerprints` attribute.

The corrected code is as follows:

```python
import logging
import os

class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```
