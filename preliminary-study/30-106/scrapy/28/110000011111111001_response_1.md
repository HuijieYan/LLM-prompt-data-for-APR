The error seems to be occurring in the `RFPDupeFilter` class when the `request_seen` method is called. This method is likely not properly checking for duplicate requests.

The bug occurs because the `open` method does not correctly populate the `fingerprints` attribute with the previously seen requests. As a result, when `request_seen` is called, it does not correctly check for duplicate requests.

To fix the bug, the `open` method needs to properly populate the `fingerprints` attribute with the previously seen requests.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method and a possible fix for the `open` method:

```python
import os
import logging

class RFPDupeFilter:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.path = path

    def open(self):
        if self.path:
            file_path = os.path.join(self.path, 'requests.seen')
            if os.path.exists(file_path):
                with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
                    self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in file)

    # add remaining methods here
```

In this corrected code, the `open` method now populates the `fingerprints` attribute with the contents of the 'requests.seen' file. This ensures that when `request_seen` is called, it correctly checks for duplicate requests.
