The bug in the provided code is that the file is not being properly closed after it is opened. This can lead to potential issues with the file not being written to or read from properly.

To fix the bug, the file should be properly closed using the `with` statement. This will ensure that the file is closed regardless of whether an exception is raised during the processing of the file.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            with open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+') as file:
                self.file = file
                self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```
