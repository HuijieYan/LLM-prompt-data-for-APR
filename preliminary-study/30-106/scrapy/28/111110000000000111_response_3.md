Potential error location: The bug seems to be in the `__init__` method, particularly in the line `self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')`. This line is supposed to open a file for reading and writing, but it doesn't handle the case where the file does not exist, which could lead to an error.

Reason for the bug: The bug is caused by the possibility that the file might not exist at the given path. If the file does not exist, the `open` function will raise a `FileNotFoundError` or `IOError`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: We should add error handling to check if the file exists at the given path and create it if it does not. We can use a `try-except` block to catch any potential errors when opening the file.

Corrected code:

```python
import os

class RFPDupeFilter(BaseDupeFilter):
    """
    Request Fingerprint duplicates filter
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            try:
                self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
                self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
            except (FileNotFoundError, IOError) as e:
                # Handle the error, e.g., create the file if it does not exist
                print(f"Error: {e}")
```
