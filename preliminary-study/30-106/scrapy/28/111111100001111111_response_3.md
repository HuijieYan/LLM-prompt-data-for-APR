The bug occurs in the initialization of the RFPDupeFilter class where the `__init__` method is not populating the `self.fingerprints` set correctly when reading from a file. The code used to open the file, read its contents, and update the set of fingerprints is not handling the file pointer properly.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the file pointer is properly positioned before reading the contents of the file.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method of the RFPDupeFilter class:

```python
import os

class RFPDupeFilter(BaseDupeFilter):
    """
    Request Fingerprint duplicates filter
    """

    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            file_path = os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen')
            if not os.path.exists(file_path):
                open(file_path, 'w').close()  # Create the file if it doesn't exist
            with open(file_path, 'r+') as file:
                self.file = file
                self.fingerprints = {line.rstrip() for line in self.file.readlines()}
```

In the corrected code:
- We use `os.path.join` to join the path and file name.
- We check if the file exists and create it if it doesn't.
- We use `with open` to open the file and automatically close it after reading its contents, ensuring that the file pointer is handled properly.
- We read the file line by line using `readlines()` and populate the `fingerprints` set correctly.
