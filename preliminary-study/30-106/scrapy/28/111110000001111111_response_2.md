The issue with the current implementation of the `__init__` method in the `RFPDupeFilter` class is that it does not handle reading from the file properly. The code attempts to update the `self.fingerprints` set by reading from the file, but it only gets the empty lines from the file and does not properly handle file reading.

To fix this issue, the file should be read line by line and the non-empty lines should be added to the `self.fingerprints` set.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
import os

class RFPDupeFilter(BaseDupeFilter):
    """
    Request Fingerprint duplicates filter
    """

    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

        if path:
            requests_seen_path = os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen')
            if os.path.exists(requests_seen_path):
                with open(requests_seen_path, 'r') as file:
                    for line in file:
                        line = line.strip()
                        if line:
                            self.fingerprints.add(line)
            else:
                with open(requests_seen_path, 'w'):
                    pass
            self.file = open(requests_seen_path, 'a+')
```

In the corrected code:
1. We use `os.path.join` to handle path concatenation.
2. We use `os.path.exists` to check if the file exists before reading from it.
3. We read the file line by line, strip each line to remove leading/trailing whitespaces, and only add non-empty lines to the `self.fingerprints` set.
4. We also handle the case where the file does not exist by creating it and immediately closing it with `with open(requests_seen_path, 'w'): pass`.

These changes will ensure that the file reading is handled correctly, and the non-empty lines are added to the `self.fingerprints` set.
