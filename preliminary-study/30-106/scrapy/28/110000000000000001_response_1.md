Potential error location: 
The potential error is with the `open` function where the file is opened but not closed. This can lead to resource leaks and potential issues when running the program for a longer period of time.

Reasons behind the bug:
The bug occurs because the file is opened but not closed, leading to potential resource leaks and issues with file handling.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use the `with open` statement to ensure the file is automatically closed after its suite finishes, even if an exception is raised.
2. Explicitly close the file using the `close` method after reading the contents.

Corrected code:
```python
import os
import logging

class ClassName:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            with open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+') as file:
                self.file = file
                self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```
