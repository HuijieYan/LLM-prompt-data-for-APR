The bug occurs in the `__init__` method of the `RFPDupeFilter` class. When the `__init__` method is called with a `path`, it is expected to open a file, and update `self.fingerprints` with the contents of the file.

The bug occurs because the file is not being closed after it is opened for reading. This can cause resource leaks and potentially result in unexpected behavior. 

To fix the bug, the file should be closed after reading its content. One approach for fixing the bug would be to use the `with` statement to automatically close the file after reading its content.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
    self.file = None
    self.fingerprints = set()
    self.logdupes = True
    self.debug = debug
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    if path:
        with open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+') as file:
            self.file = file
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```
