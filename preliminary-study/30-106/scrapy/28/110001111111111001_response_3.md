The error occurs within the `test_dupefilter_path` function on line 43, where it's asserting that `df2.request_seen(r1)` should be False, but it's True instead.

The bug is likely to be in the `request_seen` method of the `RFPDupeFilter` class, where the `request_seen` method is not working correctly to detect duplicate requests.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of the `request_seen` method to correctly identify duplicate requests based on their fingerprints.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_seen` and `__init__` methods:

```python
class RFPDupeFilter:

    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a')
            self.fingerprints = set(x.strip() for x in self.file)
            self.file.close()

    def request_seen(self, request):
        fingerprint = request_fingerprint(request)
        if fingerprint in self.fingerprints:
            return True
        self.fingerprints.add(fingerprint)
        if self.file:
            self.file.write(f'{fingerprint}\n')
        return False
```
