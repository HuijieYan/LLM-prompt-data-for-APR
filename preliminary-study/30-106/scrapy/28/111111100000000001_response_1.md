Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the `open` function where the file is not properly closed after it has been opened.

Reasons for the bug: The file is opened but never closed, which can lead to resource leaks and potential issues with file operations.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: The file should be properly closed after it is opened to prevent resource leaks. This can be achieved by using the `with` statement or explicitly calling the `close` method on the file object.

Corrected code:

```python
def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            with open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+') as file:
                self.file = file
                self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```
