The potential error location within the problematic function is the `__init__` method, specifically the part where it opens the file and updates the fingerprints.

The error is occurring because the `__init__` method is not handling the case where the file at the given path does not exist. This results in an AttributeError when trying to update the fingerprints from the file.

To fix the bug, we need to add proper error handling to check if the file exists before trying to update the fingerprints.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import os
import logging

class RFPDupeFilter:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            if os.path.exists(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen')):
                self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
                self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
            else:
                self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'w+')

    # other methods for RFPDupeFilter here...
```

With this correction, the `__init__` method will check if the file exists at the given path, and if it does not exist, it will create the file. This will prevent the AttributeError from occurring and resolve the bug.
