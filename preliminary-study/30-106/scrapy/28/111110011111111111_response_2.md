The test case `test_dupefilter_path` creates two requests, `r1` and `r2`, and then creates an instance of `RFPDupeFilter` using a temporary directory path. It then checks if the requests have been seen or not. However, the `assert df2.request_seen(r1)` fails, indicating a potential issue with the `request_seen` method in the `RFPDupeFilter` class.

The potential error location is the `request_seen` method, which is not available in the provided code. The error occurs because the `request_seen` method is not correctly implemented to check if a request has been seen or not.

To fix the bug, the `request_seen` method should be implemented to check if a request's fingerprint (which is a unique identifier for a request) is already present in the `fingerprints` set. If it is present, the method should return True, indicating that the request has been seen before. If it is not present, the method should add the request's fingerprint to the set and return False.

Here's the corrected code for the `RFPDupeFilter` class:

```python
class RFPDupeFilter(BaseDupeFilter):
    """
    Request Fingerprint duplicates filter
    """
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)

    def request_seen(self, request):
        fp = request_fingerprint(request)
        if fp in self.fingerprints:
            return True
        self.fingerprints.add(fp)
        if self.file:
            self.file.write(fp + os.linesep)
        return False
```

The `request_seen` method now calculates the request's fingerprint using `request_fingerprint` function (not provided) and checks if it's present in the `fingerprints` set. If it's not present, it adds the fingerprint to the set and the `requests.seen` file if it exists. It then returns False, indicating the request has not been seen before.
