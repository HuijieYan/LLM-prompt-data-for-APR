The test case 'test_dupefilter_path' creates two requests 'r1' and 'r2', and then creates an instance of 'RFPDupeFilter' with a 'path' and checks if the requests are seen or not.

The potential error in the 'RFPDupeFilter' class is in the '__init__' function where it opens a file and updates the 'fingerprints' set with the contents of the file. This operation is not being performed correctly, leading to the error in the test case.

The reason for the bug is that the file is opened in 'a+' mode, which appends data to the file. When the file is opened, the file pointer is at the end of the file and there are no contents to be read to update the 'fingerprints' set.

To fix the bug, the file should be opened in 'r+' mode, which allows for both reading and writing. This way, the file pointer is positioned at the beginning of the file, and the contents of the file can be read and updated to the 'fingerprints' set.

Here's the corrected code for the '__init__' function:

```python
class RFPDupeFilter(BaseDupeFilter):
    """
    Request Fingerprint duplicates filter
    """

    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'r+')
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```
