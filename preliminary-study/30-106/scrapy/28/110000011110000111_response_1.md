The error message is indicating an AssertionError at line 43 in the test_dupefilter_path function. It suggests that the df2.request_seen(r1) call is failing.

Upon analyzing the code, the potential error location is in the __init__ method for the RFPDupeFilter class. The issue might be related to the way the 'requests.seen' file is being opened and read, leading to incorrect behavior in the request_seen method.

The bug is likely occurring because when the 'requests.seen' file is opened, the cursor position is at the end of the file due to the 'a+' mode used. This can lead to the fingerprints not being read correctly and causing unexpected behavior in the request_seen method.

To fix the bug, we should modify the __init__ method to reset the file cursor to the beginning of the file after opening it, so that the fingerprints are read from the beginning.

Here's the corrected code for the __init__ method:

```python
import os
import logging

class RFPDupeFilter:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
            self.file.seek(0)  # Reset file cursor to the beginning of the file
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```

By adding the line `self.file.seek(0)`, we ensure that the file cursor is reset to the beginning of the file after opening it. This should fix the bug and prevent unexpected behavior in the request_seen method.
