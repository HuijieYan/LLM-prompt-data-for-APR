The error occurs because the `RFPDupeFilter` class does not correctly handle the file operations. The `__init__` function initializes the `file` attribute, but it does not close the file. This causes the file to remain open when a new instance of `RFPDupeFilter` is created with the same path, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, the `file` attribute should be closed in the `__del__` method of the class, which is called when the object is deleted. Additionally, the `fingerprints` attribute should be updated after the file is read to ensure that it contains the correct values.

Below is the corrected code for the `RFPDupeFilter` class:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class RFPDupeFilter(BaseDupeFilter):
    """
    Request Fingerprint duplicates filter
    """

    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.path = path
            self.open()

    def open(self):
        if not self.file or self.file.closed:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(self.path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)

    def close(self, reason):
        if self.file and not self.file.closed:
            self.file.close()

    def __del__(self):
        if self.file and not self.file.closed:
            self.file.close()

    # ... other methods ...
```

With these changes, the file is opened and closed when necessary, and the `fingerprints` attribute is properly updated with the values from the file. This should resolve the issue and prevent the error in the test case.
