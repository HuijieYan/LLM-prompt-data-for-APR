Potential Error Location: 
The error might be with the `__init__` method, specifically with the use of `self.file` and `self.fingerprints`.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug is likely occurring because the `__init__` method is not properly setting up the `file` and `fingerprints` attributes. Additionally, there is a possibility of missing imports for `os` and `logging`.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Properly initialize the `file` and `fingerprints` attributes to avoid NoneType errors.
2. Import the necessary modules `os` and `logging` if they are not already imported.

Corrected Code:
```python
import os
import logging

class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
            self.fingerprints = set(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
        else:
            self.file = None
            self.fingerprints = set()
```
