The error occurs in the `RFPDupeFilter` class where the `__init__` method is defined. The problem seems to be with the `self.file` attribute being set to `None` and then being used without proper initialization.

The bug occurs because the `self.file` attribute is not properly set when the `__init__` method is called. This means that when the `open` method is called, it throws an error as `self.file` has not been initialized with a file object.

To fix this bug, we need to properly initialize the `self.file` attribute with the file object created by opening the file located at the given path.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
import logging
import os

class RFPDupeFilter:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)

    # Other methods of the class can follow...
```

With this correction, the `self.file` attribute will be properly initialized, and the error should be resolved.
