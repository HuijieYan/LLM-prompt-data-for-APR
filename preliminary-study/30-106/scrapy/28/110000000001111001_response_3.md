The error in the given function is that it is missing the necessary imports for `os` and `logging`. Additionally, it is good practice to close the file after its use.

The missing import statements need to be added to the code. Additionally, the file variable should be closed after initializing the fingerprints set.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import os
import logging

class ClassName:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

        if path:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
            self.file.close()
```
