The bug in the given code is that the file is not being properly closed after it has been opened. This can lead to resource leakage and possibly errors when trying to access the file again.

To fix this bug, we need to add a `close` method to the file after its last use:

```python
def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
    self.file = None
    self.fingerprints = set()
    self.logdupes = True
    self.debug = debug
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    if path:
        self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
        self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
        self.file.close()
```
With this change, the file will be properly closed after it has been used, preventing any resource leakage.
