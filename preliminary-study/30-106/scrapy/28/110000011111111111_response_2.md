The problem occurs when the `request_seen` method is called. The issue seems to be related to the initialization of the `self.fingerprints` attribute in the `__init__` method. When the `path` parameter is provided, the function opens a file, reads its contents, and updates the `fingerprints` attribute with the read values. However, the file is not being closed after reading its contents, which might lead to unexpected behavior when the `request_seen` method is called.

To fix this issue, the `file` object should be closed after reading its contents. Additionally, it's a good practice to use a context manager to ensure the file is properly closed, even if an error occurs.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
import os
import logging

class RFPDupeFilter:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

        if path:
            with open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+') as file:
                self.file = file
                self.fingerprints = {x.rstrip() for x in self.file}

    def open(self):
        pass  # Implement the open method if necessary

    def request_seen(self, request):
        pass  # Implement the request_seen method if necessary

    def close(self, reason):
        pass  # Implement the close method if necessary
```

This corrected code uses a context manager (`with open(...) as file`) to open the file, read its contents into `self.fingerprints`, and automatically close the file when the block is exited. This ensures that the file is properly closed after its contents are read.
