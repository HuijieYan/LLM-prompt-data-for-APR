Potential Error:
The potential error in the given code is that the __init__ method is not properly defined. It seems like it is intended to be a class constructor, but it is missing the class definition.

Reason for the Bug:
The __init__ method is not properly defined as a class constructor because it is missing the class declaration. It should be part of a class, but it is currently written as a standalone function.

Approach to Fix the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to define a class and then put the __init__ method inside that class. This will properly create a constructor for the class.

Corrected Code:

```python
import logging
import os

class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```

In this corrected code, we define a class called `MyClass` and then put the `__init__` method inside the class. This properly defines the constructor for the class.
