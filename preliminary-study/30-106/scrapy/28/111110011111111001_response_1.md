The error occurs in the `test_dupefilter_path` test case when it asserts `df2.request_seen(r1)`. The function should return `False` since `r1` has already been seen once before. However, it seems like the function is not correctly checking for duplicate requests.

The bug seems to be located in the `request_seen` function, which is not provided in the code snippet. This function should iterate over the stored fingerprints and check if the request's fingerprint already exists. It should return `True` if the request has been seen before, and `False` otherwise. However, the current implementation of the `request_seen` function seems to have a bug causing it to return the wrong response.

To fix the bug, the `request_seen` function should be modified to correctly check if the request's fingerprint exists in the set of stored fingerprints. Additionally, the `request_seen` function might also need to calculate and store the fingerprint of the request correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `RFPDupeFilter` class with the assumption that `request_seen` function is provided elsewhere:

```python
class RFPDupeFilter(BaseDupeFilter):
    """
    Request Fingerprint duplicates filter
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)

    def request_seen(self, request):
        # Assuming request_seen function is provided elsewhere
        fingerprint = request_fingerprint(request)  # Replace with actual function to generate request fingerprint
        if fingerprint in self.fingerprints:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

The corrected code assumes that there is a `request_fingerprint` function to calculate the fingerprint of a request. This function needs to be replaced with the actual code to generate request fingerprints.
