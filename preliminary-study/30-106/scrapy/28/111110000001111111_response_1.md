The issue with the given code is that it is not reading from the file correctly. The set of fingerprints is initialized as an empty set, but it should be updated with the content of the file. However, the code `self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)` does not read from the file correctly. 

To fix this, the code should read each line from the file and add it to the set of fingerprints.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class RFPDupeFilter(BaseDupeFilter):
    """
    Request Fingerprint duplicates filter
    """

    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
            lines = self.file.readlines()
            self.fingerprints.update(x.strip() for x in lines)
```
