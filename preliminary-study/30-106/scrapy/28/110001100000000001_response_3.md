The potential error in the code is that the `__init__` function is missing the `self` parameter which is necessary for any instance method in Python.

The error occurred because the `__init__` function is missing the `self` parameter, which is required for any instance method in Python. This means that the function cannot access the instance's attributes and methods.

To fix the bug, we need to add the `self` parameter to the `__init__` function so that it can access the instance's attributes and methods.

```python
# Corrected function
def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
    self.file = None
    self.fingerprints = set()
    self.logdupes = True
    self.debug = debug
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    if path:
        self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
        self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```
