The issue with the provided `__init__` method is that it tries to access a file using the 'path' parameter without handling any potential exceptions that may occur during file access. If the file does not exist, it will throw an error or exception.

To fix this, we need to add exception handling to properly open the file and handle any potential errors.

Here's the corrected code for the __init__ method:

```python
import os

def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
    self.file = None
    self.fingerprints = set()
    self.logdupes = True
    self.debug = debug
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    if path:
        try:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
        except FileNotFoundError:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'w+')
```

In this corrected code, we added a try-except block to handle the potential FileNotFoundError when trying to open the file. If the file does not exist, it will be created.
