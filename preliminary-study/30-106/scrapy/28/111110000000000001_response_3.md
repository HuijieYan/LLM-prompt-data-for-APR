Potential Error: It appears that the code is attempting to read from a file that may not exist, and then update the set `self.fingerprints` based on the contents of the file.

Reason for the bug: The bug occurs because the code is trying to read from a file that might not exist, and it is not handling the scenario where the file doesn't exist.

Possible approach to fixing the bug: To fix the bug, we can add error handling to check if the file exists before trying to read from it. If the file exists, then we can update the set `self.fingerprints` based on the file contents.

Corrected code:
```python
import os

class RFPDupeFilter(BaseDupeFilter):
    """
    Request Fingerprint duplicates filter
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            filepath = os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen')
            if os.path.exists(filepath):
                with open(filepath, 'r') as file:
                    self.file = file
                    self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```
In the corrected code, we first check if the file exists using `os.path.exists()`. If it exists, we then open the file and update the set `self.fingerprints` based on its contents. This solution adds error handling and ensures that the code does not break if the file does not exist.
