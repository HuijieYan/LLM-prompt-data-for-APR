Potential error location: 

The potential error location is at the line `self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)`. It seems like the intention is to read the contents of the file and update the set of fingerprints, but the code as written does not do that.

Reason for the bug:

The code does not correctly read the contents of the file and update the set of fingerprints. The statement `self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)` only creates a generator expression, but it doesn't execute it to obtain the actual values.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:

To fix the bug, the code needs to iterate over the lines in the file and update the set of fingerprints with the contents of the file.

Corrected code:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class RFPDupeFilter(BaseDupeFilter):
    """
    Request Fingerprint duplicates filter
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file.readlines())
```
