The potential error location within the problematic function is the `__init__` method. 

The reason behind the bug is that the `__init__` method is not properly initializing the `file` attribute. It should be opened in read mode to retrieve existing fingerprints, and opened in append mode to add new fingerprints. Additionally, the `path` variable provided should be used to create the file if it does not exist.

To fix the bug, the `__init__` method should be modified to ensure that the file is opened correctly for reading, writing, and appending. Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
import os
import logging

class RFPDupeFilter:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

        if path:
            file_path = os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen')
            # Open file in read mode to retrieve existing fingerprints
            if os.path.exists(file_path):
                with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
                    self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in file)

            # Open file in append mode to add new fingerprints
            self.file = open(file_path, 'a+')

    def request_seen(self, request):
        # implementation of request_seen method
        pass

    def open(self):
        # implementation of open method
        pass

    def close(self, reason):
        # implementation of close method
        pass
```

With this corrected code, the file is properly opened in read mode to retrieve existing fingerprints and in append mode to add new fingerprints. This should resolve the issue encountered in the test case.
