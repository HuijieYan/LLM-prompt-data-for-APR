The error occurs at the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` within the `copy` method of the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` class. The error is a `TypeError` because the `self.columns` is of type `NoneType` and it cannot be used with the `len` function.

The bug occurred because the `columns` parameter is set to `None` in the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` instance created in the test function `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns`. 

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. We can either check if `self.columns` is not `None` before getting its length, or provide a default value for `self.columns` if it is `None`.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In this corrected code, we added a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to ensure that we only try to access the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`. If it is `None`, the condition `if self.columns` short circuits and prevents the check for length.
