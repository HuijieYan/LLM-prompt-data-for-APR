1. The test case is attempting to run a Redshift COPY job with columns set to None. This results in a TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len(), indicating that the program is trying to call len() on a NoneType object.

2. The potential error location within the copy function is the if statement checking the length of self.columns.

3. The reason for the bug is that the code does not check if self.columns is None before attempting to get its length. When columns is None, it should be handled differently than when it is an empty list.

4. To fix the bug, we can modify the if statement to check if self.columns is not None before checking its length. We can also provide a default empty list in case columns is None.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check for self.columns is not None before checking its length, we ensure that we don't try to get the length of a NoneType object. This should fix the TypeError issue encountered in the test case.
