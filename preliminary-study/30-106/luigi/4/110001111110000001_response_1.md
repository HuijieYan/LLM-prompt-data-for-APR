The error message indicates that the code is trying to get the length of a NoneType object, which is not allowed in Python.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `self.columns` variable is None, and the `len()` function cannot be called on a NoneType object.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''

    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In this corrected code, we added a check for `self.columns` to ensure it's not None before attempting to get its length. If it's not None and has a length greater than 0, then the `colnames` variable will be populated accordingly.
