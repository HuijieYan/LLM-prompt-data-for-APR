Based on the given input parameters and the error message provided in the GitHub issue, the potential error location within the buggy function is the following condition:

```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the error is that when `self.columns` is `None`, the code tries to check the length of `None`, which raises a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.

One possible approach for fixing this bug is to modify the condition to check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length. This can be achieved by using the following condition:
```python
if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
```

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
# corrected function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)

    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
