Potential error location: The line `options=self.copy_options` is missing a function call.

Reason for the bug: The `copy_options` function is not being called in the `COPY` query, so the function is not being used as intended.

Approach for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options` function in the `COPY` query.

Corrected code:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```
