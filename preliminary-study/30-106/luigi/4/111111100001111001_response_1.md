The bug in the provided code is in the `self.copy` method. The `self.copy` method is trying to execute a Redshift `COPY` command using the `cursor.execute` method, but there are issues with how the `COPY` command is constructed and passed to `cursor.execute`.

The bug occurs because the `COPY` command is not constructed correctly, and the `self.copy_options` method is not called. Also, the `cursor.execute` method is not called correctly with the `COPY` command.

To fix the bug, we need to make the following changes:
1. Call the `self.copy_options` method to get the copy options.
2. Change the way the `COPY` command is constructed to include the returned value from `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options`.
3. Correct the way `cursor.execute` is called to pass the constructed `COPY` command.

Here's the corrected code for the `self.copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    copy_options = self.copy_options()  # Call self.copy_options to get the copy options

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),  # Call self._credentials to get the credentials
        options=copy_options)  # Pass the copy options to the 'options' placeholder
    )
```

With these changes, the `self.copy` method should now construct and execute the `COPY` command correctly.
