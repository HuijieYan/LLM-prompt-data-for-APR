The error message indicates that the issue is related to a `NoneType` object not having a length. This occurs inside the `copy` method when it tries to check the length of `self.columns`.

The issue occurs because the `columns` argument is set to `None` in the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task, but the `copy` method does not handle this case. 

To fix this issue, we can modify the `copy` method to check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length, and if it is `None`, set `colnames` to an empty string.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns is None:
        colnames = ''
    else:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this modification, the code will first check if `self.columns` is `None`, and if it is, it will set `colnames` to an empty string. This will prevent the TypeError when trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.
