The issue seems to be related to the handling of the `self.columns` attribute. When `self.columns` is `None`, the code is trying to iterate over it to form the `colnames` string, leading to a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.

To fix this issue, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to iterate over it to form the `colnames` string.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In this corrected code, we added a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to form the `colnames` string.
