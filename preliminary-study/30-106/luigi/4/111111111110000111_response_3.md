The test case passes a `columns` value of `None` to the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task, and when the `copy` method is called within the task, it attempts to call `len` on `self.columns`, which results in a `TypeError` because `None` has no length.

The potential error location is identified as the line within the `copy` method:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```

The reason behind the bug is that when `columns` is `None`, calling `len(self.columns)` directly results in a `TypeError`.

To fix the bug, we should check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns and` condition, we ensure that we only attempt to get the length of `self.columns` when it is not `None`, thereby fixing the bug.
