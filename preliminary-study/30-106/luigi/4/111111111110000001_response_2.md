The error occurs because the 'columns' attribute in the 'DummyS3CopyToTableKey' class is assigned a value of 'None', causing the 'len' function to throw a TypeError as it cannot determine the length of a NoneType object.

To fix this bug, the 'copy' function should first check if the 'columns' attribute is not None before attempting to find its length.

Here's the corrected code for the 'copy' function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if columns is not None and has length greater than 0
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```
