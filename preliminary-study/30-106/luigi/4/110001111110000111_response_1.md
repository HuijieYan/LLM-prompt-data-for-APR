The test case is trying to run the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task, which calls the `copy` method from the `luigi.contrib.redshift` module. The error message indicates a `TypeError`, specifically stating that an object of type 'NoneType' (in this case, the `self.columns`) has no length, which occurred when the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` was evaluated.

Upon analyzing the code, it seems that the issue lies in the `copy` method where the length of `self.columns` is checked without first ensuring that `self.columns` is not None. This leads to the `TypeError` when trying to get the length of a NoneType object.

To fix the bug, the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` needs to be modified to account for the case when `self.columns` is None. The fix should ensure that `self.columns` is not None before checking its length to avoid the `TypeError`.

Here's the corrected `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the code first checks if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length. This change should prevent the `TypeError` and resolve the issue where Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided.
