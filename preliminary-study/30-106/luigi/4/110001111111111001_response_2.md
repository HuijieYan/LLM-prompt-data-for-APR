The error occurs at line 338 in the `run` method of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` class. It calls the `copy` method with the `cursor` and `f` parameters. Inside the `copy` method, the error occurs at line 356 when it tries to check the length of `self.columns`, and it fails because `self.columns` is of type `None`.

The reason for this bug is that the `self.columns` parameter is not being checked for None before trying to retrieve its length. This results in a `TypeError` when the code tries to get the length of None.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length. If it is None, we can default `colnames` to an empty string, as it seems to be the intended behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
