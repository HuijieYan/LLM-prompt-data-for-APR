The error occurs in the `copy` method of the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` class. The error is caused by the `if len(self.columns) > 0` line, which tries to get the length of `self.columns`, but since `self.columns` is `None`, it raises a `TypeError`. This is consistent with the error message.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
In this corrected code, we added `if self.columns and` before `len(self.columns) > 0` to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding with the length check.
