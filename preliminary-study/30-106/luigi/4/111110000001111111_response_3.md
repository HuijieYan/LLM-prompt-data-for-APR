The error is occurring because the code is checking the length of the `self.columns` attribute without first checking if it is not None. This causes a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is None.

To fix the bug, the code should first check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length. 

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected code, I added a check `if self.columns` before checking its length to avoid the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is None.
