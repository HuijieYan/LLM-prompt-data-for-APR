In the provided code, the issue is in the `copy` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class. The error message suggests that the problem arises when `self.columns` is `None` and the `len()` function is called on it. This indicates that the bug occurs when the `columns` attribute is not provided and is set to `None`.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. We can do this by modifying the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`. This will ensure that the length is only checked if `self.columns` is not `None`.

Here is the corrected code for the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With this change, the `copy` method will check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length, thereby fixing the bug identified in the issue description.
