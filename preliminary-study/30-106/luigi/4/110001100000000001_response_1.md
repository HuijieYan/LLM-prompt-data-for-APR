The potential error location within the problematic function is in the cursor.execute() statement, specifically in the use of self.copy_options. It seems like self.copy_options is meant to be a method call, but it is not being treated as such in the current code.

The bug occurs because the self.copy_options method is not being called correctly in the cursor.execute() statement. It should be invoked as a method, but it is missing parentheses after the method name.

To fix the bug, we need to call the self.copy_options method properly by adding parentheses after the method name.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())  # Corrected the method call by adding parentheses
    )
```
