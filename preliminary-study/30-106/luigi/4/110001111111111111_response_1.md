Potential error location: The error is occurring in the `copy` method of the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` class in the `luigi.contrib.redshift` module. Specifically, the issue is with the conditional check `if len(self.columns) > 0`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The error occurs because when `columns=None` is passed, it causes `self.columns` to be of type None, and you cannot call `len()` on a NoneType object. As a result, it throws a TypeError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: The conditional check `if len(self.columns) > 0` needs to be modified to handle the case when `self.columns` is None. This can be done by checking for the existence of `self.columns` before comparing its length. We can change the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` which will first check if `self.columns` exists and then proceed to check its length.

Corrected code for the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Modified conditional check
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
