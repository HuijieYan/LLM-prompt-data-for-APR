Potential error location: The error is occurring in the `copy` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi.contrib.redshift` module. The error is happening when the `len` function is called on `self.columns` when `self.columns` is None. 

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The error is occurring because when the `self.columns` attribute is set to None, the code does not handle this case properly and directly calls the `len` function on `self.columns`. This triggers a `TypeError` because `NoneType` does not have a length.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is None before calling the `len` function on it. We can use a conditional check to ensure that `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
