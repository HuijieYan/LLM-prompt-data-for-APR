Potential error location:
The error may be occurring in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where the code is trying to get the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is None.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug is occurring because the code does not check if `self.columns` is None before trying to get its length. If `self.columns` is None, then calling `len` on it will result in a TypeError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
The code should first check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```
In the corrected code, we added a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to ensure that `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length and use it in further operations.
