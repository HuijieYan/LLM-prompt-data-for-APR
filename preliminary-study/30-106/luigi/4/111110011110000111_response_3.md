The error occurs because the `self.columns` attribute is None, and the code is trying to calculate the length of a NoneType object in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:`.

To fix this bug, we can modify the condition to also check if `self.columns` is not None before calculating its length.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Modified condition to check if self.columns is not None
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

By making this change, the code will first check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to calculate its length, thus preventing the TypeError when `self.columns` is None.
