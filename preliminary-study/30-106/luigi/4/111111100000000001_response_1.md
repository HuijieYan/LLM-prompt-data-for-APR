The potential error in the `copy` function lies in the `cursor.execute` statement. It seems that there are missing parentheses after `self.copy_options` which suggests that `copy_options` should be called as a function rather than just being referenced.

The reason for the bug is that `self.copy_options` is being referenced as a function without being called. Therefore, the correct approach for fixing the bug is to call `self.copy_options()` to execute the function.

Here is the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```
