The potential error location within the problematic function is the line:

```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that when `self.columns` is None, the code tries to call len() on a NoneType, which results in the TypeError.

To fix this bug, you can modify the code to check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length. Here's the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected code, we added the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to ensure that `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length. This prevents the TypeError when `self.columns` is None.
