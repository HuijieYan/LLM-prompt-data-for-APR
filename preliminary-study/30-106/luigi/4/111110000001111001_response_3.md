The potential error in the `copy` method is in the following line:

```python
options=self.copy_options)
```

The error occurs because `self.copy_options` is being treated as a function object, but it should have been called as a method to get the actual value returned. Another potential issue is that the `copy_options` method is not being called at all.

To fix this issue, we need to call the `copy_options` method to get its actual value. We also need to change `self._credentials` to `self._credentials()`, as it is a method and should be called to get its return value.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```
