Potential error location: The error occurs at the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` within the `copy` method. The error is caused when the `columns` attribute of the instance `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` is set to `None`, leading to a `TypeError` when the length of `None` is checked.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The error occurs because the code explicitly checks the length of `self.columns` without first ensuring that `self.columns` is not `None`. When `self.columns` is set to `None`, the `TypeError` is raised.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Update the if statement to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to retrieve its length. This can be achieved using the `and` logical operator.
- Alternatively, use the Pythonic approach of checking if `self.columns` exists and is non-empty.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns exists and is non-empty
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```
