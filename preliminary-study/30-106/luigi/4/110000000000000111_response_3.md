Potential error location:
The error lies in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where it attempts to check the length of `self.columns` without ensuring that `self.columns` is not None.

Reason behind the bug:
The error occurs because the code does not handle the case where `self.columns` is None. It assumes that `self.columns` will always have a value, leading to a TypeError when it is None.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to access its length.
2. Handle the case where `self.columns` is None separately.

Corrected code:

```python
# Corrected function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected code, we added a check for `self.columns` to ensure it is not None before attempting to access its length. If `self.columns` is None, the `if` condition will fail, and `colnames` will remain empty, which is the desired behavior.
