Potential error location: The error is occurring in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The error is happening on the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The error is caused by checking the length of `self.columns` without first checking if `self.columns` is not None. When `columns` is `None`, the `len` function cannot be applied directly, resulting in a `TypeError`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, it's necessary to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length. This can be done by changing the condition to `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:`.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fixed condition to check for None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```
