The bug is occurring because the code is not properly handling the case when `self.columns` is `None`. This is causing the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error.

To fix the bug, the code needs to be modified to explicitly check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to access its length.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
# this is the fixed function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, the code explicitly checks if `self.columns` is not None before trying to access its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring and the function should work as intended.
