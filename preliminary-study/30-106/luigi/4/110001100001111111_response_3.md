The error in the provided function is likely occurring due to the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` when `self.columns` is None.

The reason behind the bug is that when `self.columns` is None, the code is trying to get the length of a NoneType object, which leads to the TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len().

To fix this bug, you can update the condition to first check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, the code will first check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length, avoiding the TypeError when `self.columns` is None.
