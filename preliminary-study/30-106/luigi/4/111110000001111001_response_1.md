The potential error in the `copy` function is in the `cursor.execute` statement where the `copy_options` should be called as a method, but it is missing parentheses, and instead, it is being referenced as an attribute. This causes the `copy_options` to be treated as a method, which leads to an error.

To fix this bug, you should call `copy_options` as a method by adding parentheses after `self.copy_options` in the `cursor.execute` statement.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}()
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```
