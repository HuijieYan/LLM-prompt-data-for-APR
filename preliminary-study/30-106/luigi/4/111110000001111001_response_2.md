Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is in the `cursor.execute` statement within the `copy` method. The `copy_options` variable is not being called as it should be a method, but instead, it's being referenced as an attribute.

Reason for the Bug:
The `copy_options` method is not being properly invoked with `()` in the `cursor.execute` statement. This results in `copy_options` being passed as a method object instead of calling the method to retrieve the appropriate options.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
Call the `copy_options` method to retrieve the options and use these options in the `cursor.execute` statement.

Corrected Code:
```python
# this is the corrected function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    # Call the copy_options method to retrieve the options
    options = self.copy_options()

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=options)
    )
```
