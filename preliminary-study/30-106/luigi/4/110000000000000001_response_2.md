Potential error location: The potential error location is within the `cursor.execute` block where the SQL query is being formatted.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug is occurring because the SQL query string is not being properly formatted. There are missing closing brackets for the `colnames` variable and the `options` variable.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add a closing bracket for the `colnames` variable after the format call.
2. Add a closing bracket for the `options` variable after the format call.

Corrected code:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options
        ))
