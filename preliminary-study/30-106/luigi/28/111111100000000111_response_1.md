The issue here is that the `table_exists` function is case-sensitive when checking for the existence of tables in Hive. This means that if the table name is different in case from what is stored in Hive, the function will return False.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to be case insensitive when checking for the existence of tables in Hive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output of the Hive command to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected code, both the `table` and the `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison. This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive, and the function will return the correct result regardless of the case of the table name.
