Error location: 

The issue is in the `table_exists` method of the `HiveCommandClient` class. When the `partition` parameter is not None, the `run_hive_cmd` function is using the `self.partition_spec(partition)` method, which is not defined in the class.

Reason for the bug:

The `partition_spec` method is not defined in the `HiveCommandClient` class, so calling this method will result in an AttributeError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

One approach to fix the bug is to define the `partition_spec` method within the `HiveCommandClient` class, or modify the code to use an existing method that serves the same purpose.

Another approach is to refactor the code to remove the need for the `partition_spec` method altogether, if it is not necessary for the functionality of the `table_exists` method.

Corrected code:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # This is the fixed function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_string = 'partition ({0})'.format(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} {2}'.format(database, table, partition_string))

            return bool(stdout)  # Return True if stdout is not empty, False otherwise
```
