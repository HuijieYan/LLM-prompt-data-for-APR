The issue here is with the `table_exists` method in the `HiveCommandClient` class. The method should be able to correctly determine if a table or a partition exists in the specified database. The bug is causing incorrect results and failing the test cases.

Upon reviewing the provided test cases and the error messages, it seems that the bug is causing the `table_exists` method to incorrectly determine whether tables or partitions exist. The method is not parsing the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function correctly, causing it to return incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the method can be modified to properly parse the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and then determine whether the table or partition exists.

Here's the corrected `table_exists` method:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        tables = stdout.split('\n')
        return table in tables
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        partitions = stdout.split('\n')
        return bool(partition in partitions)
```

In this corrected method:
1. For the case where `partition is None`, the method splits the output by newline and checks if the table exists in the list of tables.
2. For the case where `partition` is not None, the method splits the output by newline and checks if the specified partition exists in the list of partitions.

With this modification, the `table_exists` method should now correctly determine if a table or partition exists and pass the provided test cases.
