The error is occurring in the `table_exists` method of the `HiveCommandClient` and `ApacheHiveCommandClient` classes. The error message indicates that the test cases are failing, leading to assertions being raised.

The issue in the `table_exists` method is likely due to the comparison of the table name in the `stdout` variable. When the `table_exists` method checks if the `stdout` contains the table name, it does an exact word match. However, the `stdout` string may contain additional information, new lines, or other characters, which can cause exact word matching to fail.

To fix the bug:
- Instead of checking if the table name is in the `stdout` with an exact word match, it should check if the table name exists in the `stdout` string as a substring.
- It may also be necessary to consider case insensitivity when comparing table names, as indicated by the test case for "MyTable".

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` method:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By using the `lower()` method to convert both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase, we ensure case insensitivity and increase the chances of successful matching.

After making these changes, the test cases for the `table_exists` method should pass without raising any assertions.
