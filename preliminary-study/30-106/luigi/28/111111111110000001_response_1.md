The error message suggests that the `table_exists` function is returning `False` when it should be returning `True`. Looking at the code, the problematic line appears to be `self.assertTrue(returned)` in the test case for the `table_exists` function.

Upon further analysis, it seems that the issue lies in the `table_exists` function when checking for the existence of a table with a certain name. The bug occurs when checking the existence of a table with a specific partition.

The bug occurs because if the partition is not `None`, the function incorrectly constructs the command to check for the existence of the table with the specified partition.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to correctly handle the case when a partition is specified. The function should correctly build the command to check for the existence of the table with the specified partition.

Here's the corrected `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_query = ','.join(["{0}={1}".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, partition_query))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected function, the query to check for the existence of the table with the specified partition is constructed correctly. The `partition_spec` function is no longer used because the partition specification is built directly in the `table_exists` function, thus resolving the bug.
