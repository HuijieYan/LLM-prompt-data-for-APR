The buggy function `table_exists` seems to have an issue with how it constructs the Hive command and checks the output. 

The issue seems to be with the second part of the if-else statement in the function, where it runs a Hive command to show partitions. It is not properly handling the case when `partition` is not None.

The bug occurs because in the if-else statement, when the `partition` is not None, it incorrectly constructs the Hive command.

To fix the bug, it would be best to construct the Hive command for checking table existence and showing partitions separately, and properly handle the `partition` parameter in both cases.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        command = 'use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table)
    else:
        command = 'use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))
    
    stdout = run_hive_cmd(command)
    
    return table in stdout if stdout else False
```
