Potential Error Location: The bug is likely occurring in the `table_exists` method where the comparison between the table and the stdout is done without considering case sensitivity.

Reasons behind the Bug: The bug occurs because the comparison between the table name and the stdout is case-sensitive. This means that if the table name is in a different case than the one returned by Hive, the comparison will fail and the function will return a false negative.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: One possible approach to fix this bug is to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them. This will make the comparison case-insensitive.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` method:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```
In this corrected code, the table name and the stdout are both converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, fixing the bug.
