The potential error in the table_exists function is the use of self.partition_spec(partition) which looks like it should be a method of the same class but is not defined within the class.

The reason for the bug is that the partition_spec method is being called as a method of the class, but it has not been defined within the class. 

To fix this bug, the partition_spec method should be defined within the class, or the code should be modified to use the appropriate method to get the partition specification.

Here's the corrected code for the table_exists function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        if partition is not None:
            partition_str = "partition ({})".format(','.join(["{}='{}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()]))
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} {2}".format(database, table, partition_str))
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1}".format(database, table))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
