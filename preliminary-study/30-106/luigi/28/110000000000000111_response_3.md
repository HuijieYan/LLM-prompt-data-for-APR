Potential error location: The bug is likely occurring in the comparison between the table name and the table names returned in the stdout. It seems that the comparison is case-sensitive, causing the function to incorrectly return False when the table exists but with a different case.

Reason for the bug: The function is not handling case sensitivity when comparing the table names obtained from the hive command with the input table name.

Approach for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, we need to handle the case sensitivity issue by converting both the table name and the table names obtained from the hive command to lowercase for comparison.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout)
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected code, the comparison between the table name and the table names obtained from the hive command is case insensitive, allowing the function to correctly identify whether the table exists.
