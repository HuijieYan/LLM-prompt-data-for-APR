The error in the `table_exists` method is that it does not account for case sensitivity when comparing the table name from the command output with the input table name. This results in the test failures where the function is expected to be case insensitive.

The bug occurs because the function does not convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the tables listed in the `stdout`. As a result, when the input table name has different cases than the tables listed in `stdout`, the comparison fails.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` method should convert both the input table name and the tables listed in `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` method:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` method will now perform case-insensitive matching for the input table name with the tables listed in the `stdout`, resolving the test failures related to case sensitivity.
