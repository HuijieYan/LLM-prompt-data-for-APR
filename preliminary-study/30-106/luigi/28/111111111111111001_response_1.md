Issue:
The issue seems to be with the `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` and `ApacheHiveCommandClient` classes. The test cases are failing because the `table_exists` function is not handling the case insensitivity for table names correctly.

Reason:
The `table_exists` function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and check if a table exists. When the table name is provided as input, the function should handle both upper and lower case table names to ensure case insensitivity. This is not being done in the current implementation leading to the failure of test cases.

Approach:
To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should convert the table name to lowercase before checking for its existence in the Hive command output. This will ensure that case insensitivity is handled correctly. Additionally, the function should handle the case when the partition is not None and use the correct query format for showing partitions with a specified partition specification.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    table = table.lower()  # Convert table name to lowercase
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.lower()  # Check for table existence in case-insensitive manner
    else:
        partition_filter = ' and '.join([f"{k}='{v}'" for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_filter})")

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this corrected code, the `table_exists` function should handle case insensitivity for table names and correctly handle the showing of partitions with a specified partition specification. This should resolve the failing test cases.
