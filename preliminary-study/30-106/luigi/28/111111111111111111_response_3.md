The error occurs due to the case sensitivity of the table names when checking for table existence. The bug is located in the `table_exists` function, where it compares the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function without considering the case sensitivity.

To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` needs to be made case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This change will ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` is case insensitive, fixing the bug and allowing the test cases to pass successfully.
