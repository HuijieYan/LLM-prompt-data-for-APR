The error message "AssertionError: False is not true" indicates that the test is failing because the expected value is not being returned by the `table_exists` function.

Upon analyzing the code, the potential error location seems to be in the `table_exists` function, specifically in the else condition where the `run_hive_cmd` is being invoked with incorrect arguments, and the return value is not being handled correctly.

The bug occurs because in the else condition of the `table_exists` function, the `run_hive_cmd` is being used with incorrect arguments. The `show partitions` command is not being constructed properly, leading to incorrect behavior when checking for the existence of a table with a specific partition.

To fix this bug, the `run_hive_cmd` function invocation in the else condition of the `table_exists` function needs to be corrected to construct the `show partitions` command properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)  # Get partition spec
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_spec))

        if stdout: 
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With these changes, the bug involving the incorrect construction of the `show partitions` command in the `table_exists` function should be resolved.

Additionally, the test function should be updated to use the corrected function `test_apacheclient_table_exists` instead of `test_table_exists`, and the respective client instance `apacheclient` should be used instead of `self.client` to reflect the changes made in the function name.
