Based on the provided test cases and the associated error messages, it seems that the bug is occurring in the `table_exists` method of the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi.contrib.hive` module. The error message indicates that the test is failing when trying to check if the table exists in a case-insensitive manner.

The issue seems to stem from the fact that the `table_exists` method does not handle case sensitivity properly. It is comparing the table name directly without considering the case. As a result, the test case fails when trying to check for the existence of a table with a different casing.

To fix this bug, the `table_exists` method should convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it to the stdout from the `run_hive_cmd`. This would ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` method:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By making these changes, the `table_exists` method will now handle the table name in a case-insensitive manner and should resolve the test failures.
