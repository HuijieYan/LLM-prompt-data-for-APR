The test case provided is testing the `table_exists` method of the `HiveCommandClient` class. It uses mock objects to simulate the behavior of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

The error message indicates that the assertion `self.assertTrue(returned)` failed, suggesting that the `table_exists` method did not return `True` as expected.

Upon analyzing the `table_exists` method, it's apparent that the bug is related to the logic inside the `else` block. When a partition is specified, the method constructs a command to execute using `run_hive_cmd`, but the construction of the command appears to be incorrect. Additionally, there may be issues with how the `partition_spec` method is used.

The bug occurs because the string formatting in the `else` block is incorrect, leading to an incorrect command being executed. Additionally, the usage of `self.partition_spec(partition)` appears to be incorrect.

To fix the bug, the formatting of the command and the usage of `self.partition_spec(partition)` needs to be corrected. Additionally, the condition for checking the output of the command should be adjusted.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic `table_exists` method:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_clause = ' and '.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            query = 'use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition_clause)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(query)

            return bool(stdout)
```
