The code appears to be attempting to check whether a table exists in a Hive database. The `table_exists` function should check for the existence of a table in the database, and the current implementation uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive queries and then parse the output to determine whether the table exists.

The bug occurs when the function tries to parse the partition specification in the case where a partition is provided. This likely stems from the way the `stdout` is being handled after running the Hive commands.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for parsing the `stdout` after executing the Hive commands to properly determine the existence of the table. We should also handle both the cases where `partition` is provided and where it is not.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, ', '.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])))
        
        return len(stdout.strip()) > 0
```
