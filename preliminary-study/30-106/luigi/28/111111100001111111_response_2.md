The issue is with the `table_exists` method in the `HiveCommandClient` class. The method checks for the existence of a table in Hive, but it is case sensitive. This means that if a table name is provided in a different case than what is in the Hive metadata, the method will not work as expected.

The reason behind the bug is that the method compares the table name directly with the output from Hive, without considering the case.

To fix this bug, the method should convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` method:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # ... other methods ...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

The correction involves converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them. This ensures that the table name is compared in a case-insensitive manner with the output from Hive.
