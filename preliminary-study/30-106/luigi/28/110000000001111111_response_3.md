The bug in the provided function is that it does not handle the case sensitivity of table names in the Hive database. When the function checks for the existence of a table, it does not convert the table name to lowercase, leading to false negatives if the table name is in a different case than expected.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to compare the lowercase version of the table name with the output from the Hive command, after converting the output to lowercase as well.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected function, we use `table.lower()` to convert the table name to lowercase, and `map(str.lower, stdout.split())` to convert each table name in the output to lowercase as well. This ensures that we are performing a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command.

With this modification, the function will now correctly handle case sensitivity in table names and return the expected results.
