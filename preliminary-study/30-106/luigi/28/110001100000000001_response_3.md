Potential error location: 
The `run_hive_cmd` function is called without referencing it properly which could lead to a NameError.

Reason for the bug:
The `run_hive_cmd` function is being called directly without referencing it properly, which could lead to a NameError. 

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Import the `run_hive_cmd` function from the same module and use it properly.
2. Check if the `run_hive_cmd` function is defined in another module and import it from there.

Fixed code:
```python
# Import the run_hive_cmd function from the same module
from luigi.contrib.hive import run_hive_cmd

class ClassName:
    # other methods...
    
    # Corrected table_exists method
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            # Correctly calling the run_hive_cmd function
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```
