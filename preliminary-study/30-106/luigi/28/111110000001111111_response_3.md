The buggy function `table_exists` has a bug in the comparison of table names. It does not handle case insensitivity, so it fails to match tables if their case does not match exactly with the input table name.

The function compares the input table name with the tables returned in the `stdout`, but the comparison is case-sensitive. If the input table name is in a different case than the one returned by Hive, the comparison will fail.

To fix this bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the input table name and the tables in `stdout` to lowercase for the comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this fix, the comparison of table names will be case insensitive, and the function will return the correct result regardless of the case of the table names.
