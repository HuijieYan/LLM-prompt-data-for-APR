The potential error in the `table_exists` function is in the line where the `stdout` variable is assigned within the else block. The `run_hive_cmd` function is called with the arguments that include `%s`, which is intended to be replaced with the values of `database`, `table`, and `self.partition_spec(partition)`, but it is not being replaced correctly. 

The bug occurs because the string formatting in the `run_hive_cmd` function is not being done correctly. The `%s` placeholders are not being replaced with the correct values, which leads to incorrect command execution.

To fix the bug, we can use the `format` method for string formatting in Python. Additionally, we need to check whether the partition is None before trying to construct the command for showing partitions.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_str = ''
        if partition:
            partition_str = 'partition ({})'.format(self.partition_spec(partition))

        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} {2}".format(database, table, partition_str))

        return bool(stdout)
```
