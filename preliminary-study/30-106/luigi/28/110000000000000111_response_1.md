The bug in the provided function is that it doesn't handle the case sensitivity of table names correctly when checking for table existence in a database. The bug occurs because the function compares the table name directly with the output from the Hive command, without considering the case sensitivity of the table names.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to be case insensitive when checking the existence of a table. We can do this by converting both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lower case before comparing them.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This fix ensures that the table existence check is case insensitive, allowing the function to correctly detect the existence of tables regardless of their case.
