The bug in the `table_exists` method is causing the test cases to fail. The bug occurs because the method is not case insensitive when checking if a table exists in the database. This means that if the table name provided to the method is in a different case than the actual table name in the database, the method will fail.

To fix this bug, the `table_exists` method should convert both the table name and the stdout to lower case before comparing them.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` method:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` method will be case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in the database.

The corrected code should now pass the test cases without any assertion errors.
