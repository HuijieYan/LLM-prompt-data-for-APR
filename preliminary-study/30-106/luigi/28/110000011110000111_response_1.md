Based on the error message from the test function and the provided buggy function, it seems that the issue is related to case sensitivity. The test case "Issue #896 test case insensitivity" fails, indicating that the table_exists function is case sensitive.

The potential error in the problematic function is the comparison between the input table name and the tables returned from the hive command. When comparing the input table name to the tables returned from the hive command, the comparison should be case insensitive to handle different cases of table names.

The bug occurs because the comparison of the table name is case sensitive. Hive returns the table names in lowercase, and the comparison doesn't account for the case difference.

To fix the bug, the comparison should be case insensitive. Adjust the comparison to compare the lowercase version of the input table name with the lowercase version of the tables returned from the hive command.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

The corrected function uses the lowercase version of the input table name and the tables returned from the hive command for comparison, making the comparison case insensitive. This should resolve the issue with case sensitivity in the table_exists function.
