The bug in the provided code is with the use of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function `run_hive_cmd` is not defined, and it is assumed to be available in the environment where the code is executed. 

The `run_hive_cmd` function should be a mock object because it is being used in testing, and its return value should be set for different test cases. Additionally, the `self` argument should be explicitly passed in the `table_exists` method.

To fix the bug, the `run_hive_cmd` function needs to be mocked appropriately in the test cases. The `table_exists` method should also be modified to properly handle the `self` argument.

Here is the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
# corrected table_exists function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = self.run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = self.run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected code, `run_hive_cmd` is now assumed to be a method of the object, so it is called using `self.run_hive_cmd`, which makes it possible to mock it for testing.

Additionally, the `test_table_exists` and `test_apacheclient_table_exists` tests should use `self.client.run_hive_cmd` and `self.apacheclient.run_hive_cmd` respectively to mock the `run_hive_cmd` method of the client object.

```python
@mock.patch("luigi.contrib.hive.HiveCommandClient.run_hive_cmd")
def test_table_exists(self, run_command):
    # test cases

@mock.patch("luigi.contrib.hive.ApacheHiveCommandClient.run_hive_cmd")
def test_apacheclient_table_exists(self, run_command):
    # test cases
```

With these changes, the tests should pass without any assertion errors.
