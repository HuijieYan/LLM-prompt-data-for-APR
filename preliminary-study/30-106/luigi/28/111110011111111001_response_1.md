The bug in the `table_exists` method seems to be related to how the stdout is handled when `partition` is not None. The function does not properly handle the case when partition is not None, which leads to incorrect results in some test cases.

The bug occurs because the `table_exists` function is not correctly using the `partition` parameter when it is not None. It uses the `partition_spec` method, but the way it is being passed is incorrect.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to properly format the query when a partition is provided. The function should construct the query using the `partition` parameter directly, rather than trying to use the `partition_spec` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` method:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_query = " AND ".join([f"{k}='{v}'" for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_query))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected code constructs the query for the partition case using the `partition` parameter directly and handles the results accordingly. After applying this fix, the test cases provided should pass without any errors.
