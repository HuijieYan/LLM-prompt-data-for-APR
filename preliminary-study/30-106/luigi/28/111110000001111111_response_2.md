The buggy function `table_exists` is failing to correctly determine if a table exists in the database due to case sensitivity issues. The function checks if the table name is present in the output of a Hive command, but it does not handle the case sensitivity of the table name.

This is evident from the GitHub issue description, where it is mentioned that tables defined with capitalized names are returned as lower case by Hive, leading to test failures.

To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table name and the output of the Hive command to lower case for comparison. This will make the comparison case insensitive and ensure that the function can correctly determine if the table exists.

The corrected code for the `table_exists` function is as follows:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version, both the `table` name and the `stdout` output are converted to lower case using the `lower()` method before comparison. This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive and resolves the bug.
