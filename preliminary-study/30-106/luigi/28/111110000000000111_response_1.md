Potential Error Location:
The bug seems to be in the table_exists method of the HiveCommandClient class. The bug occurs when the code checks for the existence of a table in Hive, as it does not take into account the case sensitivity of the table name.

Reasons for the Bug:
Hive is case insensitive, so when checking for table existence, the method should account for case differences in table names. Currently, the method only checks for an exact match, leading to failures when the case of the table names does not match.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the code should convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase (or uppercase) before comparing them. This would ensure that the comparison is case insensitive and works regardless of the case of the table name.

Corrected Code:
```python
# corrected table_exists method
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, partition_spec))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected code, the table name is converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method, and both the table name and the stdout from Hive are compared in lowercase to make the comparison case insensitive. Additionally, the code for the else block is modified to return a boolean value directly based on the existence of stdout.
