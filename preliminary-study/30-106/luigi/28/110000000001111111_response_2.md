The bug in the provided function is that it is case sensitive when checking if a table exists in the Hive database. This means that if the table name is provided in a different case than how it is stored in Hive, the function will incorrectly report that the table does not exist.

To fix this bug, the function needs to be modified to make the table existence check case insensitive.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before performing the comparison. This will ensure that the comparison is case insensitive.

Here is the corrected code for the table_exists function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

The modified function checks for the existence of the table in a case-insensitive manner by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparing them. This will ensure that the function correctly identifies the table's existence regardless of the case in which the table name is provided.
