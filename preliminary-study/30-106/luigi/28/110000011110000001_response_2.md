The error message indicates that the test case is failing because the `table_exists` function is returning False when it should be returning True. This suggests that there is a bug in the `table_exists` function that is causing it to return incorrect results.

Upon analyzing the `table_exists` function, it appears that there are issues with the conditionals and the use of the `run_hive_cmd` function. 

The first conditional in the function checks if `partition` is None. If it is None, it uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute a Hive command and return whether the table exists or not. However, the logic inside the conditional is incorrect, and it does not handle the case where the table does not exist properly.

The second conditional handles the case where `partition` is not None, but the logic inside this conditional is also incorrect. It does not properly handle the case where the partition does not exist, which could lead to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to properly handle the case if the table or partition does not exist and return the correct result.

Here's the corrected `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected function, the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function is directly checked for table and partition existence, and the result is returned accordingly. The conditions are simplified to return the result of the check directly, and the `bool` function is used to convert the `stdout` to a boolean value.
