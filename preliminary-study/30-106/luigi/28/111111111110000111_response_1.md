The error occurs in the test function `test_table_exists` of the file `contrib/hive_test.py`. When the function calls `self.client.table_exists("MyTable")`, it expects the result to be True but receives False instead, leading to an AssertionError.

The potential error location within the `table_exists` function is in the `if partition is None` block and specifically in the comparison `table in stdout`. The comparison might be case-sensitive, causing the test to fail when trying to match "mytable" with "MyTable".

The reason behind the bug is that the comparison is not case-insensitive, leading to incorrect results when checking if a table exists in Hive.

To fix the bug, we can modify the comparison to be case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this change, the comparison will be case-insensitive, and the test case should pass without any AssertionError.
