The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the use of the `run_hive_cmd` function to check if a table exists in a specific database. The function is using `run_hive_cmd` to execute Hive commands and check the output to determine if the table exists.

The bug appears to be in the way the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function is being checked. The function is expecting the output to be the exact table name if the table exists, which may not always be the case. Additionally, the function does not seem to handle the case where the table name appears in the middle of a string.

A possible approach to fix the bug is to modify the way the function checks the output of `run_hive_cmd` to more accurately determine if the table exists. This could involve parsing the output to look for the specific table name and database combination.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
        return any(table == t.strip() for t in stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout != ""
```

In the corrected code, for the case where `partition` is None, the function fetches all tables in the database and checks if the specific table exists. For the case with a `partition` specified, the function checks if the output is not an empty string, indicating that the table exists. This approach should provide more accurate results when checking if a table exists in a database.
