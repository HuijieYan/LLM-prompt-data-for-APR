The bug is in the `table_exists` method of the `HiveCommandClient` and `ApacheHiveCommandClient` classes. The bug occurs when the `stdout` variable is checked using `table in stdout` and `stdout` is also checked directly without any conditional.

The potential error location is the `if` condition where `stdout` is checked. The reason for the error is that the `stdout` is not being properly processed before comparison. It may contain unwanted characters like newline, tab, or spaces which are not being handled.

To fix the bug, we can strip the `stdout` before checking it and modify the conditions to handle both scenarios.

Here is the corrected code for the `table_exists` method:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout.strip()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout.strip())
```
