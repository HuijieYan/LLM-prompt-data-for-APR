The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing the test cases to fail. The main issue seems to be that the function is not handling case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database.

The bug is occurring because the function is not considering case sensitivity when comparing the table name. This causes the function to return incorrect results, leading to test failures.

To fix this bug, the `table_exists` function should convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them. This will ensure that the comparison is case insensitive and will correctly determine the existence of the table in the Hive database.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this fix, the `table_exists` function will correctly handle case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. This should resolve the test failures and ensure the correct behavior of the function.
