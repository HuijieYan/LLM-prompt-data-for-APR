The potential error in the provided function is the use of the `run_hive_cmd` function without importing it or defining it within the function. This is likely causing an error when running the function.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `run_hive_cmd` function is not defined or imported within the provided function, and therefore the function cannot be executed properly.

To fix the bug, the `run_hive_cmd` function needs to be properly defined or imported within the function so that it can be used to execute the Hive commands.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        # Assuming run_hive_cmd is properly defined or imported
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        # Assuming run_hive_cmd is properly defined or imported
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected code, it is assumed that the `run_hive_cmd` function has been properly defined or imported, allowing it to be used within the function to execute the necessary Hive commands.
