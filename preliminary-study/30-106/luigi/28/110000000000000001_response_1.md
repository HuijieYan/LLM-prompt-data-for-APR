The potential error in the function is related to the condition checking for the presence of the table in the database. 

The reason behind the bug is that in the else block, the condition "if stdout" is checking for the presence of any string in the stdout, but it should actually be checking for the presence of the table in the stdout.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition in the else block to check for the presence of the table in the stdout.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return table in stdout
```
