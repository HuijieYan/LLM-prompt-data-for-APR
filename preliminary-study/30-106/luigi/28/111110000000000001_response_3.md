The bug in the `table_exists` function is in the else block when `partition` is not None. There is a formatting issue and a missing `show tables` command in the else block.

The reason for the bug is that the string formatting in the else block is not done correctly and the `show tables` command is missing.

To fix the bug, we need to change the formatting and add the `show tables` command in the else block as well.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}" partition ({2});'.format(database, table, ", ".join(self.partition_spec(partition))))
        return stdout and table in stdout
```
