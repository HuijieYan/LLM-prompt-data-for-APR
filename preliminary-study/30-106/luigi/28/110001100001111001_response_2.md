The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is using the `run_hive_cmd` function without the correct scope. The function `run_hive_cmd` is a standalone function and needs to be called using its full path. 

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to update the function to correctly call the `run_hive_cmd` using its full path, and to also correct the formatting of the command when `partition` is not None.

Below is the corrected `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = luigi.contrib.hive.run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = luigi.contrib.hive.run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, ','.join(["%s=%s" % (key, value) for key, value in partition.items()])))
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
