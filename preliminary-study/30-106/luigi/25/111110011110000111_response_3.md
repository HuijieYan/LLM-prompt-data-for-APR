The error occurs when the `run` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class is called, specifically at the line `path = self.s3_load_path()` which raises a `TypeError: 'str' object is not callable`. This means that `s3_load_path` is being treated as a method or function, but it is actually a string attribute.

The reason for this error is that in the `run` method, `self.s3_load_path` is being called as a function, but it is defined as a string attribute.

To fix the bug, the `s3_load_path` attribute should be accessed without the parentheses, as it's not a method to be called.

Here is the corrected `run` method:

```python
def run(self):
    """
    If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
    will be called to attempt to create the table.
    """
    if not self.table:
        raise Exception("table needs to be specified")
    
    path = self.s3_load_path  # Fixed: Removed the parentheses
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)
    
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()
    
    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```

This change should resolve the `TypeError` and correctly access the `s3_load_path` attribute.
