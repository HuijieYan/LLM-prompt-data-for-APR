The error occurs in the `S3CopyToTable` class's `run` method where the `s3_load_path` method is being called with parentheses, but it is actually a property.

The bug occurs because the `s3_load_path` is being accessed as a method, but it is actually a property. This causes a TypeError because it is trying to call a string object as a function.

To fix this bug, the `s3_load_path` should be accessed as a property without parentheses.

Here's the corrected code for the `run` method:

```python
def run(self):
    """
    If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
    will be called to attempt to create the table.
    """
    if not (self.table):
        raise Exception("table need to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```
