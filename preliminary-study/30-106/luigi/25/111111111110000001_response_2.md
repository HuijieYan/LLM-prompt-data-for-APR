The error message indicates that a 'TypeError' occurred at line 166 of the file 'luigi/contrib/redshift.py' in the 'run' method of the 'S3CopyToTable' class. The error specifically mentions that a string object is being called as a function, which is not allowed.

The potential error location is within the line `path = self.s3_load_path()` in the 'run' method of the 'S3CopyToTable' class.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the variable 'self.s3_load_path' is being mistakenly called as a function, when it is actually a string.

To fix this bug, the 's3_load_path' attribute should be defined as a string variable instead of a method/function.

Here's the corrected code for the 'S3CopyToTable' class:

```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable):
    """
    Template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from s3.
    ...
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    s3_load_path = "path_to_s3_here"
    
    # ... omitted code ...

    def run(self):
        """
        If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
        will be called to attempt to create the table.
        """
        if not (self.table):
            raise Exception("table need to be specified")
    
        path = self.s3_load_path  # Use the variable directly
        connection = self.output().connect()
        if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
            # try creating table
            logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
            connection.reset()
            self.create_table(connection)
        elif self.do_truncate_table():
            logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
            self.truncate_table(connection)
    
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        self.init_copy(connection)
        self.copy(cursor, path)
        self.output().touch(connection)
        connection.commit()
    
        # commit and clean up
        connection.close()
```

By making the 's3_load_path' attribute a string, the issue with calling a string as a function is resolved.
