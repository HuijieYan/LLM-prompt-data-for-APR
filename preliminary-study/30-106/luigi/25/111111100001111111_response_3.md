The error occurs in the `S3CopyToTable.run` method at the line `path = self.s3_load_path()`. The error message indicates a TypeError: 'str' object is not callable, which means that `self.s3_load_path` is being treated as a string rather than a method or function. This suggests that `self.s3_load_path` is incorrectly defined or assigned as a string instead of being a method or function.

To fix this issue, you should ensure that `self.s3_load_path` is defined as a method or function within the `S3CopyToTable` class. 

Here's the corrected method for `S3CopyToTable.run`:

```python
def run(self):
    """
    If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
    will be called to attempt to create the table.
    """
    if not (self.table):
        raise Exception("table need to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path  # Remove the parentheses to avoid calling it as a method
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```

By removing the parentheses after `self.s3_load_path`, we are now referencing the method or function itself, rather than trying to call it like we were previously.
