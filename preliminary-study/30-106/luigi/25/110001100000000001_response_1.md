The error in the code is that the function "run" is not properly defined and is missing the necessary parameters to execute the code.

The potential error location is in the "run" function where it is trying to call other functions such as create_table, truncate_table, s3_load_path, etc. without passing the necessary parameters.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the "run" function is trying to call other functions without passing the required parameters, leading to errors.

To fix the bug, we need to pass the necessary parameters to the functions being called within the "run" function.

Here's the corrected code for the "run" function:

```python
def run(self, table, connection):
    """
    If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
    will be called to attempt to create the table.
    """
    if not (table):
        raise Exception("table needs to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```
