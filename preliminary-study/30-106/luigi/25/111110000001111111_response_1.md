The error occurs on line 166, where the `self.s3_load_path()` method is being called. However, it seems that this should be a property instead of a method. The error message "TypeError: 'str' object is not callable" indicates that the `s3_load_path` property is being treated as a method and called with parentheses, but it is actually a string.

To fix this bug, the `s3_load_path` property should be accessed directly without using parentheses to call it.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def run(self):
    """
    If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
    will be called to attempt to create the table.
    """
    if not (self.table):
        raise Exception("table need to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path  # Accessing the property directly
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```

By making this change, the `s3_load_path` property will be accessed directly, addressing the TypeError that occurred when it was mistakenly called as a method.
