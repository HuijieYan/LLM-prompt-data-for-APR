The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError` at line 166 of the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The error message specifically states that a 'str' object is not callable, which means that a string is being used as a function, leading to this TypeError.

Looking at the provided code, the error seems to be occurring at the line `path = self.s3_load_path()`. The error message points towards the `self.s3_load_path` being of type string and being used as a function.

The reason this error occurs is likely due to a misunderstanding or misplacement of the `s3_load_path` attribute within the `S3CopyToTable` class. It seems like `s3_load_path` is being mistakenly treated as a method (function) instead of an attribute.

To fix this bug, the `s3_load_path` should be treated as a string attribute and accessed directly without calling it as a method.

Here's the corrected code for the `S3CopyToTable` class:

```python
def run(self):
    """
    If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
    will be called to attempt to create the table.
    """
    if not (self.table):
        raise Exception("table need to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path  # Fix: access s3_load_path as an attribute
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```
