The error message indicates that the code is trying to call a string as a function in the `run` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class. This is occurring at line 166 of the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file.

The reason for this error is that `self.s3_load_path` is being assigned a string value instead of a function. Later in the `run` method, the code is trying to call `self.s3_load_path` as a function, which results in a `TypeError` because a string is not callable.

To fix this bug, the `s3_load_path` attribute in the `S3CopyToTable` class should be assigned a function, not a string. Once the correct attribute is assigned, the `run` method should be able to call it as intended.

Here is the corrected code for the `S3CopyToTable` class:

```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable):
    """
    Template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from s3.
    
    Usage:
    
    * Subclass and override the required attributes:
      * `host`,
      * `database`,
      * `user`,
      * `password`,
      * `table`,
      * `columns`,
      * `aws_access_key_id`,
      * `aws_secret_access_key`,
      * `s3_load_path`.
