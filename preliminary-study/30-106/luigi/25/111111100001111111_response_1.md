The error is occurring on line 166 of the run function in the S3CopyToTable class. It is calling the s3_load_path method as a function, but it should be called as a method instead.

The reason for the bug is that the s3_load_path is being called as a function, but it is actually a method of the class S3CopyToTable. This is causing a TypeError because a string is not callable like a function or method.

To fix the bug, the s3_load_path method should be called without the parentheses, treating it as a method of the class rather than a function.

Here's the corrected code for the run function:

```python
def run(self):
    """
    If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
    will be called to attempt to create the table.
    """
    if not (self.table):
        raise Exception("table need to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path  # Call the method without parentheses
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```

With this change, the s3_load_path method is called correctly without causing a TypeError.
