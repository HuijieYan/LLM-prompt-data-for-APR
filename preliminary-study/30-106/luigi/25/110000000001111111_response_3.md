The error is occurring at `path = self.s3_load_path()` within the `run` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class. The error message "TypeError: 'str' object is not callable" indicates that `self.s3_load_path` is being treated as a method when it is actually a string.

The function is attempting to invoke `self.s3_load_path()` as if it were a method, resulting in a TypeError because `self.s3_load_path` is a string and not a callable object.

To fix this bug, the code should be modified to access the `s3_load_path` property directly without attempting to call it as a method.

```python
# Corrected function
def run(self):
    """
    If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
    will be called to attempt to create the table.
    """
    if not (self.table):
        raise Exception("table need to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path  # Modify this line
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```

By making this change, the code will correctly access the value of `self.s3_load_path` without attempting to call it as a method. This will resolve the TypeError that was occurring.
