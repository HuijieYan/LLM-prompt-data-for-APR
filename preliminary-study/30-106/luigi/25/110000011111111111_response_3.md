Based on the error message and the provided code, the issue is occurring because `self.s3_load_path` is being called as a function when it is actually a string. This causes the "TypeError: 'str' object is not callable" error.

To fix this issue, the `self.s3_load_path` should be referenced as a string instead of calling it as a function. The line `path = self.s3_load_path()` should be changed to `path = self.s3_load_path`.

Here's the corrected code for the `run` method:

```python
def run(self):
    """
    If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
    will be called to attempt to create the table.
    """
    if not (self.table):
        raise Exception("table needs to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path  # Fix: Removed the parentheses
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```

With this change, the code should no longer attempt to call `self.s3_load_path` as a function and should instead use it as a string.
