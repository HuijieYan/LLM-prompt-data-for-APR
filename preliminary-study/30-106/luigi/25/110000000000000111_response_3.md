Potential error location: The error seems to be related to the `TypeError: 'str' object is not callable` when trying to call `self.s3_load_path()`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `TypeError` occurs because `self.s3_load_path` is being treated as a method (callable) instead of an attribute. This is likely because `self.s3_load_path` was mistakenly defined as a parameter in the `MyRedshiftTask` class.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Modify the definition of `s3_load_path` in the `MyRedshiftTask` class to be an attribute instead of a parameter, as it is being used as an attribute and not a method.
2. Remove the `s3_load_path` definition from the `MyRedshiftTask` class altogether and use it as an attribute inherited from the `S3CopyToTable` class.

Corrected code:
```python
# this is the corrected function
def run(self):
    """
    If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
    will be called to attempt to create the table.
    """
    if not self.table:
        raise Exception("table needs to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path  # Changed self.s3_load_path() to self.s3_load_path
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```
