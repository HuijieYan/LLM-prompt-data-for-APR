The error "TypeError: 'str' object is not callable" is occurring at the line `path = self.s3_load_path()` in the `run` method of the `DummyS3CopyToTable` class.

The reason for this error is that `self.s3_load_path` is being called as a method, but it is actually a string attribute. This means that `self.s3_load_path` cannot be called like a function, hence the "str object is not callable" error.

To fix the bug, we need to replace `self.s3_load_path()` with `self.s3_load_path` in the `run` method of the `DummyS3CopyToTable` class.

Here's the corrected `run` method:

```python
def run(self):
    """
    If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
    will be called to attempt to create the table.
    """
    if not (self.table):
        raise Exception("table need to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path  # Corrected line
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```
