Potential Error Location:
The error seems to be occurring in the run() method where it is not able to handle the table parameter properly and there are some issues with the connection object as well.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The run() method is not properly handling the table parameter and is not checking if it is empty or not. Additionally, there are issues with the connection object where it is not being handled properly throughout the method.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the table parameter is empty before proceeding with the method.
2. Ensure that the connection object is properly handled and closed after its usage.

Corrected Code:

```python
def run(self):
    """
    If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
    will be called to attempt to create the table.
    """
    if not self.table:
        raise Exception("table needs to be specified")
    
    path = self.s3_load_path()
    connection = self.output().connect()
    
    try:
        if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
            # try creating table
            logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
            connection.reset()
            self.create_table(connection)
        elif self.do_truncate_table():
            logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
            self.truncate_table(connection)
        
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        self.init_copy(connection)
        self.copy(cursor, path)
        self.output().touch(connection)
        connection.commit()
    
    finally:
        # commit and clean up
        cursor.close()
        connection.close()
```
