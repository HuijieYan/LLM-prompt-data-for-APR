The error occurs on line 166 in the `run` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class. The error is a TypeError: 'str' object is not callable.
The issue is likely due to the fact that `self.s3_load_path` is being treated as a method/function and called like one, when it is actually defined as a string attribute.

To fix this issue, the `s3_load_path` method should be renamed to `get_s3_load_path` and defined as a property, not as a regular method. Then, the `run` method should access it using `self.get_s3_load_path` (as both a method and as a regular attribute).

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable):
    """
    Template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from s3.
    
    Usage:
    
    * Subclass and override the required attributes:
      * `host`,
      * `database`,
      * `user`,
      * `password`,
      * `table`,
      * `columns`,
      * `aws_access_key_id`,
      * `aws_secret_access_key`,
      * `s3_load_path`.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    @property
    def get_s3_load_path(self):
        return self.s3_load_path

    # this is the corrected function
    def run(self):
        if not self.table:
            raise Exception("table needs to be specified")
    
        path = self.get_s3_load_path()
        connection = self.output().connect()
        if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
            # try creating table
            logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
            connection.reset()
            self.create_table(connection)
        elif self.do_truncate_table():
            logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
            self.truncate_table(connection)
    
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        self.init_copy(connection)
        self.copy(cursor, path)
        self.output().touch(connection)
        connection.commit()
    
        # commit and clean up
