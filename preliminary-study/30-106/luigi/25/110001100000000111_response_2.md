The error occurs due to the line `path = self.s3_load_path()` in the `run` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class. The error message "TypeError: 'str' object is not callable" indicates that `self.s3_load_path` is being treated as a string and being called as a function, which is not the intended behavior.

This error occurs because `self.s3_load_path` is being accessed as a class property rather than a method. The correct syntax to access a class property is just `self.s3_load_path` without the parentheses.

To fix the bug, remove the parentheses when accessing the `s3_load_path` property in the `run` method. This will ensure that it is treated as a property rather than a callable method.

Here's the corrected code for the `run` method:

```python
def run(self):
    """
    If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
    will be called to attempt to create the table.
    """
    if not (self.table):
        raise Exception("table need to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path  # Remove the parentheses
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```
