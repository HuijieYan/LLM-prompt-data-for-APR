The potential error in the provided code is that the function `s3_load_path` is not returning any value. It is defined as a method but does not have any code inside its body.

The error occurs because when the function `s3_load_path` is called in the `run` method, it does not return a value, causing potential issues with the subsequent code that depends on the output of `s3_load_path`.

To fix this, the `s3_load_path` method should be modified to return the path value.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# corrected run function
def run(self):
    """
    If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
    will be called to attempt to create the table.
    """
    if not (self.table):
        raise Exception("table needs to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path()  # calling the s3_load_path method to get the path value
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```
