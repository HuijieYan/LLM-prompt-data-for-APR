The error message 'TypeError: 'str' object is not callable' is likely caused by calling the `self.s3_load_path()` method with parentheses, which implies that `s3_load_path` is a method, but it is actually defined as a parameter in the `MyRedshiftTask` class. This leads to the TypeError because `s3_load_path` is a string and cannot be called as a function.

To fix this issue, you need to remove the parentheses when accessing `self.s3_load_path` in the `run` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class.

Here is the corrected code for the `run` method:

```python
def run(self):
    """
    If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
    will be called to attempt to create the table.
    """
    if not self.table:
        raise Exception("table needs to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path  # Remove parentheses
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```

By removing the parentheses, the code will correctly access the `s3_load_path` attribute of the class, and the TypeError should be resolved.
