The error "TypeError: 'str' object is not callable" indicates that the variable `self.s3_load_path` is being treated as a function and called, but it is actually a string. This is evident in the error message as it says "path = self.s3_load_path()".

#### Reason for the bug:
The bug occurs because the `self.s3_load_path` attribute is being treated as a callable function, but it is actually a string. This is a logical error in the code.

#### Approach to fix the bug:
To fix the bug, the `self.s3_load_path` should be accessed as an attribute, not called as a function.

#### Corrected code:
```python
def run(self):
    """
    If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
    will be called to attempt to create the table.
    """
    if not self.table:
        raise Exception("table needs to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path  # corrected code
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```
