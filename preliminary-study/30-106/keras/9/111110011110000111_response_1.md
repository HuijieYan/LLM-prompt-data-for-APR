The error message indicates a discrepancy between the expected and actual HTML representations of the docstrings. The bug seems to be related to the formatting of lists and bullet points in docstrings.

The potential error in the problematic function is likely the logic for processing and reformatting the list blocks within the docstring. It seems that the function is not handling the transformation of the list items into HTML bulleted lists correctly, resulting in the assertion error in the test case.

The bug is caused by the function not properly reformatting the list items in the docstring into HTML bulleted lists. As a result, the expected and actual representations of the docstrings are not matching, leading to the assertion error.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly identify list items, transform them into HTML bulleted lists, and then update the docstring accordingly. Additionally, the function needs to properly handle the removal of leading white spaces and the transformation of list roots.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else ending_point - 1)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    # Format list items into HTML bulleted lists
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)', r'- __\1__:\2', line) for line in lines]
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ', '', line) if not re.match(r'- __\w+__:.+', line) else line for line in lines]
    # Fix text lines after lists
    indent = 0
    text_block = False
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        spaces = re.search(r'\S', line)
        if spaces:
            # If it is a list element
            if line[spaces.start()] == '-':
                indent = spaces.start() + 1
                if text_block:
                    text_block = False
                    lines[i] = '\n' + line
            elif spaces.start() < indent:
                text_block = True
                indent = spaces.start()
                lines[i] = '\n' + line
        else:
            text_block = False
            indent = 0
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
```

This corrected code includes updated logic to properly format list items into HTML bulleted lists and handle the removal of leading white spaces. After making these improvements, the function should be able to process the docstrings correctly and resolve the formatting issue observed in the test case.
