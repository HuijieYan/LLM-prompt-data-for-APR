The error occurs because the function `process_list_block` does not properly handle lists in the input `docstring`. The function is supposed to process a block of text and extract and manipulate the lists within it. However, the current implementation fails to correctly handle the lists, leading to the assertion error in the test case.

The potential error location within the function is the handling of list elements and their respective indentation levels.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function fails to correctly identify and process list elements and their indentation levels. This leads to incorrect processing of the input `docstring`, resulting in the assertion error in the test case.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly identify and handle list elements and their indentation levels within the input `docstring`. This can be achieved by using regular expressions to detect list elements and their indentation levels, and then appropriately manipulating the text based on these patterns.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else ending_point - 1)]
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = docstring[:starting_point] + docstring_slice + docstring[section_end:]

    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    # Add list markers and process indentation
    new_lines = []
    for line in lines:
        if line.lstrip().startswith('-'):
            indent = len(line) - len(line.lstrip())
            new_line = re.sub(r'^\s*[-*+]\s*', '- ', line[indent:])
            new_lines.append(new_line)
        else:
            new_lines.append(line)

    block = '\n'.join(new_lines)
    return docstring, block
```

In the corrected code, regular expressions are used to detect list elements and their indentation levels. The `re.sub` function is used to add list markers and process the indentation accordingly, ensuring that the lists are correctly processed within the `docstring`.
