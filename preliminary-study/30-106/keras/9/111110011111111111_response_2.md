The error message indicates that there is an issue with the formatting of the bullet points under the "Arguments" section. This is likely related to the incorrect processing of the list block in the `process_list_block` function.

Looking at the function, the issue may be caused by incorrect handling of the line breaks and bullet points. The function should properly identify list items and format them as bullet points while maintaining correct indentation.

One possible approach for fixing this bug is to revise the logic for processing list items within the `process_list_block` function. The function should correctly identify list items based on the leading spaces and the presence of bullet points. It should also handle the replacement of the block and the overall formatting of the docstring.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else
                                      ending_point - 1)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    
    lines = block.split('\n')
    
    # Iterate through the lines to process list items.
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        line = line.lstrip()  # Remove leading white spaces
        if line.startswith('- '):  # If it is a list item
            lines[i] = f'- {line[2:]}'  # Add '-' for bullet points
        else:  # If it is not a list item
            lines[i] = line  # Keep the line as is
    
    # Reconstruct the block with updated list items
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    
    return docstring, block
```

This corrected code addresses the issue by properly identifying list items and adding bullet points for correct formatting. It then reconstructs the block with the updated list items. This should resolve the issue with the formatting of bullet points under the "Arguments" section.
