The bug is likely located in the `process_list_block` function, where it processes the given `docstring` and converts it into a formatted block. The test case `test_doc_lists` is failing because the expected output is in markdown format with unordered list (`<ul><li>`) tags, while the actual output is in simple paragraph tags (`<p>`).

The reason behind the bug is that the `process_list_block` function is not properly converting the input `docstring` into the expected format for lists.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `process_list_block` function to properly convert the input `docstring` into markdown format with unordered list tags.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else
                                      ending_point - 1)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub(r'^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    # Format list items as unordered list
    lines = [re.sub(r'^- (.+)', r'<li>\1</li>', line) for line in lines]
    block = '<ul>\n' + '\n'.join(lines) + '\n</ul>'
    return docstring, block
```

In this corrected function, the list items are formatted using `<li>` tags to create an unordered list structure. This change ensures that the output is in the expected markdown format with unordered list tags, which should address the failing test case.
