The bug appears to be in the `process_list_block` function. The function is meant to process a block of text to reformat it, but it seems to be causing issues with the markdown of the output.

The error message from the test function indicates that there is a mismatch between the expected output and the actual generated output. This is likely due to incorrect processing of the list block in the `process_list_block` function.

The bug seems to be happening because the function is not correctly reformatting the list items and is not handling the bullet points correctly.

To fix the bug, the function `process_list_block` needs to be adjusted to correctly handle the formatting of the list items. This can be done by ensuring that the list items are correctly identified and reformatted using the appropriate markdown syntax.

Here's the corrected `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else ending_point - 1)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    # Reformating list items using markdown syntax
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    - (.*)', r'<li>\1</li>', line) for line in lines]
    block = '<ul>\n' + '\n'.join(lines) + '\n</ul>'
    return docstring, block
```

This corrected function properly reformat the list items using HTML unordered list syntax.
