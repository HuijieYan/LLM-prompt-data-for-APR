The bug in the provided function `process_list_block` seems to be due to incorrect slicing of the `docstring` and manipulations of the `block` variable. Additionally, the replacement of leading spaces and the manipulation of list items is not working as intended. This leads to incorrect formatting of the text in the documentation for Keras models, resulting in test failures.

To fix the bug, the slicing and manipulation of `docstring` and `block` variables need to be adjusted. Additionally, the handling of leading spaces and text block manipulation needs to be revised.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:ending_point]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = docstring[:starting_point] + docstring_slice + docstring[section_end:]

    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]

    # Replace leading spaces of list items with appropriate markdown
    lines = [re.sub(r'^([ ]*)(- __[^:]+__):(.*)', r'\1- **\2:**\3', line) for line in lines]

    # Fix text lines after lists
    indent = 0
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        line_indent = len(line) - len(line.lstrip())
        if line.lstrip().startswith('-'):
            lines[i] = ' ' * (line_indent - 4) + '- ' + lines[i].lstrip()
        else:
            lines[i] = ' ' * (line_indent - 4) + lines[i].lstrip()

    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
```

In the corrected code:
- The slicing of the `block` variable has been adjusted to ensure that the end point is correctly identified.
- Leading spaces are replaced with appropriate markdown, and the subsequent code has been restructured to ensure correct text block manipulation.
- Test the function with the provided test case to ensure it's functioning as expected.

With these changes, the function should now format the `docstring` correctly, resolving the issue reported against the Keras models documentation.
