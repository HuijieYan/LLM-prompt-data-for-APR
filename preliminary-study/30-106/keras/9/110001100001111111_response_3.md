The function `process_list_block` seems to be incorrectly handling the construction of the `docstring` and the `block`. This results in incorrect formatting and content in the `docstring` and subsequently the `block`. The issue seems to be related to the handling of the `ending_point` and `section_end` variables, as well as the replacement of the `block` in the `docstring`.

To fix this bug, we need to make sure that the `ending_point` variable is correctly calculated. Additionally, when constructing the `docstring`, we need to ensure that the `block` is replaced in the correct manner.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else ending_point)]
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    top_level_regex = r'^([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)'
    top_level_replacement = r'- __\1__:\2'
    lines = [re.sub(top_level_regex, top_level_replacement, line) for line in lines]
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ', '', line) for line in lines]
    indent = 0
    text_block = False
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        spaces = re.search(r'\S', line)
        if spaces:
            if line[spaces.start()] == '-':
                indent = spaces.start()
                if text_block:
                    text_block = False
                    lines[i] = '\n' + line
            elif spaces.start() < indent:
                text_block = True
                indent = spaces.start()
                lines[i] = '\n' + line
        else:
            text_block = False
            indent = 0
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
```

With the corrected function, the `docstring` and `block` should now be properly processed and formatted without any errors or missing content.
