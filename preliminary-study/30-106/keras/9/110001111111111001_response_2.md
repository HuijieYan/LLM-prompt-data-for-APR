The error is likely occurring due to improper handling of the list items in the `block` variable, resulting in a mismatch between the expected and actual markdown representation.

The potential error lies in the processing of lines to remove leading white spaces from each line and the subsequent list processing. The function seems to be incorrectly replacing the list items and removing the leading spaces.

The issue occurs when detecting and replacing list items as well as when adjusting the indentations and text blocks.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the replacement of list items and the removal of leading spaces, ensuring that the indentations and text blocks are correctly identified and processed.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else ending_point - 1)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = docstring[:starting_point] + docstring_slice + docstring[section_end:]

    lines = block.split('\n')
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)', r'- __\1__:\2', line) for line in lines]
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ', '', line) if line.startswith('    ') else line for line in lines]
    lines = ['\n' + line if line.startswith('-') else line for line in lines]

    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly process the list block and return the expected result, ensuring accurate markdown representation.
