The test case compares two strings, one of which contains an unordered list represented as an HTML string and the other represents the expected value. The error message shows the actual and expected values, highlighting the difference.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the transformation of the input into the expected output format, specifically related to the list items.

The bug occurred because the transformation of the list items in the input string was not handled correctly, leading to differences between the actual and expected output strings.

To fix the bug, the handling of list items in the input string should be modified to ensure that the transformation into the expected output list format is accurate.

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else
                                      ending_point - 1)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    # Handle list items format
    lines = [re.sub(r'^- __([^_]+)__: (.*)', r'<li><strong>\1</strong>: \2</li>', line) for line in lines]
    # Construct unordered list
    block = '<ul>\n' + '\n'.join(lines) + '\n</ul>'
    return docstring, block
```
