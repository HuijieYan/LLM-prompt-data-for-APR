The bug seems to be related to the manipulation of the `docstring` and the `block` in the `process_list_block` function. It appears that the slicing and manipulation of the `docstring` and `block` are not working correctly, resulting in incorrect formatting of the `block` variable.

One potential approach to fixing this bug is to ensure that the manipulation of the `docstring` using the `starting_point` and `section_end` is done accurately, and that the `block` is extracted properly. Additionally, the regex and replacements for the `lines` and `top_level` sections should be reviewed to ensure they are working as intended.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    if ending_point == -1:
        block = docstring[starting_point:]
    else:
        block = docstring[starting_point:ending_point]

    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    
    lines = block.split('\n')

    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]

    # Replace list roots with proper formatting
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)', r'- __\1__:\2', line) for line in lines]
    
    # Remove all other leading spaces
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ', '', line) for line in lines]

    # Fix text lines after lists
    indent = 0
    text_block = False
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        spaces = re.search(r'\S', line)
        if spaces:
            # If it is a list element
            if line[spaces.start()] == '-':
                indent = spaces.start() + 1
                if text_block:
                    text_block = False
                    lines[i] = '\n' + line
            elif spaces.start() < indent:
                text_block = True
                indent = spaces.start()
                lines[i] = '\n' + line
        else:
            text_block = False
            indent = 0
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
```
