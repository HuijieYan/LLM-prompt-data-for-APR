Potential error location:
The error seems to be caused by the incorrect formatting of the bullet points in the docstring generated by the function `process_list_block`. This is evident from the assertion error message in the test function, which compares the actual HTML output with the expected result. The incorrect bullet points in the docstring are causing the mismatch.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The function `process_list_block` is supposed to process the docstrings and reformat them as per the desired output format, including handling bullet points for lists. However, due to incorrect processing and formatting of bullet points, the resulting docstring does not match the expected format.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Identify the section where the bullet points (lists) are being processed and ensure that the correct HTML or markdown list syntax is generated.
2. Check the regular expressions used for identifying and replacing list contents to ensure they are capturing the list items accurately.
3. Consider using a parsing library or built-in functions for handling and formatting lists to prevent manual errors in list processing.

Corrected code for the problematic function (`process_list_block`):
```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else
                                      ending_point)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    
    # Add bullet point formatting for list items
    lines = ['- ' + line.lstrip() if line.lstrip().startswith(('-', '*')) else line for line in lines]
    
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
```

In the corrected code, after removing leading whitespaces, a check is added to identify list items (lines starting with '-' or '*') and prepend them with a bullet point to ensure correct formatting. This adjustment should resolve the issue with incorrect bullet points in the docstring.
