The error seems to be with the processing of the docstring in the `process_list_block` function. It appears that the function is trying to reorganize the docstring and replace certain sections with markers, but it is currently not handling the indentation and bullet points correctly.

The reason behind the bug is that the function is not properly identifying and handling the different levels of indentation in the docstring for lists and text blocks.

To fix this bug, the function needs to correctly identify the different levels of indentation for list items and text blocks. It should also handle the bullet points and indentation within the docstring properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else
                                      ending_point - 1)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    # Fix text lines after lists
    indent = 0
    text_block = False
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        spaces = re.search(r'^\s*\S', line)
        if spaces:
            if spaces.group().startswith('-'):
                # If it is a list element
                if not text_block:
                    lines[i] = '- ' + line.lstrip()
            elif not text_block:
                line_indent = len(line) - len(line.lstrip())
                if line_indent > indent:
                    text_block = True
        if text_block:
            lines[i] = '    ' + line
        else:
            lines[i] = lines[i].lstrip()
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
```

This corrected code includes new logic to properly identify list elements, handle indentation, and handle text blocks in the docstring. It also uses regular expressions to identify list elements and different levels of indentation accurately.
