The bug occurs when trying to replace the 'block' inside 'docstring_slice' with the 'marker', which results in an incorrect string assignment. This is due to the incorrect indexing used in slicing 'docstring' in the line:
```
docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
```
Additionally, the splitting of lines and subsequent modification may not be aligned with the original purpose of the function.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to adjust the indexing of the 'docstring' string when creating 'docstring_slice', and ensure that the 'block' is correctly replaced by the 'marker'. Furthermore, the manipulation of the 'lines' list should be reviewed for proper removal of leading spaces, handling of list elements, and fixing text lines.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:section_end]
    
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[:starting_point] + marker + docstring[section_end:]
    
    lines = block.split('\n')
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    
    # Identify list roots and remove leading spaces
    indent = 0
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        if lines[i].strip().startswith('-'):
            lines[i] = '- ' + lines[i][leading_spaces:]
        else:
            lines[i] = lines[i][leading_spaces:]
    
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring_slice, block
```
