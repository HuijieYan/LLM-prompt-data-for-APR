The bug seems to be in the way the function handles the conversion from a list to a string. The error message indicates that the expected output is in the form of an unordered list (<ul>) with list items (<li>) for each element, while the actual output is simply a string with hyphens (-).

The potential error location is likely in the section of the code where the lists are being processed, specifically where it starts with `top_level_regex = r'^    ([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)'`. This section is responsible for converting list structures to a specific format, and the issue might be related to how it's stripping the leading spaces and converting to a list format.

The bug occurred because the code is incorrectly processing and converting the lists within the docstring. The regular expressions and replacements are not effectively converting the list items into the expected format.

To fix the bug, we can modify the regular expressions and replacements to accurately convert the list items into an unordered list format (<ul>) with list items (<li>). Additionally, the conversion of leading spaces and removing of list markers should be handled more accurately.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else
                                      ending_point - 1)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    
    lines = [re.sub(r'^' + ' ' * leading_spaces + r'\- ', '<li>', line) for line in lines]
    block = '<ul>\n' + ''.join(['  ' + line + '\n' for line in lines]) + '</ul>'
    
    return docstring, block
```
This corrected code processes the list blocks in the docstring, correctly converting them into an unordered list format (<ul>) with list items (<li>).
