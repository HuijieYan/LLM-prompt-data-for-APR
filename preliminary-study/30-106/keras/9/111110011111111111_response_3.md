The `process_list_block` function is modifying the `docstring` and `block` variables in an incorrect way, resulting in an incorrect output and failure of the test cases.

The reason for the bug is that the function is not correctly replacing the `block` in the slice of `docstring` with the `marker`. This results in an incorrect `docstring` and `block` extraction and modification.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the replacement of the `block` with the `marker` in the `docstring`, and also adjust the creation of `block` to ensure it is correctly extracted from the `docstring`.

Below is the corrected code for the `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(section_end if section_end != -1 else len(docstring))]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')

    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]

    top_level_regex = r'^    ([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)'
    top_level_replacement = r'- __\1__:\2'
    lines = [re.sub(top_level_regex, top_level_replacement, line) for line in lines]
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ', '', line) for line in lines]

    indent = 0
    text_block = False
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        spaces = re.search(r'\S', line)
        if spaces:
            if line[spaces.start()] == '-':
                indent = spaces.start() + 1
                if text_block:
                    text_block = False
                    lines[i] = '\n' + line
            elif spaces.start() < indent:
                text_block = True
                indent = spaces.start()
                lines[i] = '\n' + line
        else:
            text_block = False
            indent = 0
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
```

This corrected code properly extracts and replaces the `block` in the `docstring`, as well as handles the subsequent modifications and formatting of the `block`. This should address the issues and fix the bug.
