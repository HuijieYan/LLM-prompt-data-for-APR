The bug in the provided code seems to be related to the processing of the 'block' variable and its list items. It appears that the processing of bullet points and white spaces is not functioning as expected, resulting in incorrect formatting of the docstring.

The reason behind the bug is likely due to issues with the indentation and processing of list items in the 'block' variable. The code is attempting to identify list items and modify their formatting, but it seems to be missing some cases or incorrectly handling whitespace.

To fix the bug, we can simplify the code and ensure that it correctly identifies list items and processes them accordingly. This may involve re-evaluating the regex patterns and the logic for identifying and processing list items and their associated text. Additionally, proper handling of white spaces and indentation is crucial for correct formatting.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else
                                      ending_point - 1)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    
    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub(r'^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    
    # Handle list items and their indentation
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]

        if line.lstrip().startswith('-'):
            lines[i] = '- ' + re.sub(r'^\s*-\s*', '', line)  # Correct bullet points and indentation
        else:
            lines[i] = re.sub(r'^\s*', '', line)  # Remove extra leading white spaces
    
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
```

This corrected code simplifies the processing of list items and their indentation, ensuring that bullet points and white spaces are handled correctly. Therefore, it should resolve the formatting issues with the docstring and correctly display the arguments section for models like ModelCheckpoint and EarlyStopping.
