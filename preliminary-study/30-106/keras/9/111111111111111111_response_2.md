The error message indicates that the function "process_list_block" is not correctly formatting the output, specifically related to the list in the "Arguments" section of the documentation.

Upon analyzing the code, it seems that the issue might be related to the calculation of the "ending_point" and how the "docstring_slice" is replacing the "block".

The reason behind the bug might be the incorrect handling of the "ending_point" and the replacement of "block" with "docstring_slice".

To fix the bug, the calculation of "ending_point" needs to be adjusted to include the newline character. Additionally, the replacement of "block" with "docstring_slice" should be carefully handled to ensure that the formatting is correct.

Here's the corrected code for the "process_list_block" function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else ending_point)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)', r'- __\1__:\2', line) for line in lines]
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ', '', line) for line in lines]
    indent = 0
    text_block = False
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        spaces = re.search(r'\S', line)
        if spaces:
            if line[spaces.start()] == '-':
                indent = spaces.start() + 1
                if text_block:
                    text_block = False
                    lines[i] = '\n' + line
            elif spaces.start() < indent:
                text_block = True
                indent = spaces.start()
                lines[i] = '\n' + line
        else:
            text_block = False
            indent = 0
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
```
This correction ensures that the "ending_point" calculation includes the newline character, and the replacement of "block" with "docstring_slice" is handled correctly to maintain the formatting.
