The potential error location within the problematic function is in the process_list_block method where it processes the list block from the docstring.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the method is not correctly processing and replacing the list block in the docstring, which leads to incorrect formatting of the docstring.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the method correctly processes the list block in the docstring and replaces it with the marker as intended.

Here's the corrected code for the process_list_block method:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else ending_point - 1)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = docstring[:starting_point] + docstring_slice + docstring[section_end:]
    lines = block.split('\n')
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    indent = 4
    lines = [re.sub(r'^' + ' ' * indent, '', line) if line.strip() != '' else line for line in lines]
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
```
