The bug seems to be related to the conversion of the list items in the docstring to markdown format. It appears that the formatting for lists is incorrect, causing the AssertionError in the test case.

The potential error location within the function is the part where the list items are being modified and formatted.

The bug is likely occurring because the function is not correctly processing the list items in the docstring and converting them to the markdown format. This is causing the discrepancy between the expected and actual output in the test case.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to properly handle the list items in the docstring and convert them to the correct markdown format.

Here is the corrected code for the function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else
                                      ending_point)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    # Usually lines have at least 4 additional leading spaces.
    # These have to be removed, but first the list roots have to be detected.
    top_level_regex = r'^([ ]*)([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)'
    top_level_replacement = r'\1- __\2__:\3'
    lines = [re.sub(top_level_regex, top_level_replacement, line) for line in lines]
    # All the other lines get simply the 4 leading space (if present) removed
    lines = [re.sub(r'^[ ]{4}', '', line) for line in lines]
    # Fix text lines after lists
    indent = 0
    text_block = False
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        spaces = re.search(r'\S', line)
        if spaces:
            # If it is a list element
            if line[spaces.start()] == '-':
                indent = spaces.start() + 1
                if text_block:
                    text_block = False
                    lines[i] = '\n' + line
            elif spaces.start() < indent:
                text_block = True
                indent = spaces.start()
                lines[i] = '\n' + line
        else:
            text_block = False
            indent = 0
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
```

The corrected code includes changes to the regular expressions for identifying list items and their corresponding replacements, as well as modifications to the removal of leading spaces for each line. This should ensure that the function processes the list items correctly and produces the expected markdown format in the docstring.
