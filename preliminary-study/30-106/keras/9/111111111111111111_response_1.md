The error stems from the `process_list_block` function, which is intended to process a given list block within a docstring, including the removal of leading spaces, transformation into a markdown list, and fixing text lines after lists. The bug seems to be caused by incorrect processing of the list block, leading to an incorrect representation of the bullet points in the test results.

The expected outcome is for the `process_list_block` function to correctly format the list block from the docstring, ensuring that the bullet points are represented appropriately in the markdown output.

One potential approach to fixing the bug is to revise the logic that processes the list block within the `process_list_block` function. This includes ensuring that the leading spaces are removed correctly, and the list items are transformed into markdown list format, while also fixing text lines after lists as necessary.

Here's the corrected `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else
                                      ending_point - 1)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    
    markdown_lines = []
    list_started = False
    for line in lines:
        if line.strip().startswith('-'):
            if not list_started:
                list_started = True
                markdown_lines.append("<ul>")
            markdown_lines.append(f"<li>{line.strip().lstrip('- ')}</li>")
        else:
            if list_started:
                list_started = False
                markdown_lines.append("</ul>")
            markdown_lines.append(line)
    if list_started:  # Close the list if it was still open
        markdown_lines.append("</ul>")
    
    block = '\n'.join(markdown_lines)
    
    return docstring, block
```

This revised function introduces a new logic that correctly formats the list block from the docstring into a markdown list format, ensuring that the bullet points are represented appropriately. The function now checks for lines starting with '-' to identify list items and uses HTML-style `<ul>` and `<li>` tags for creating the markdown list.
