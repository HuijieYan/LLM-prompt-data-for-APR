The error message is comparing two strings and finding a mismatch. The expected output contains an unordered list (`ul`) while the actual output does not.

The issue is likely with the `process_list_block` function, specifically with the conversion of list items to an unordered (bulleted) list in the docstring. It seems that the function is not converting list items to an unordered list, which is causing the assertion error.

To address this issue, the function should be modified to properly convert list items to an unordered list in the docstring.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else
                                      ending_point - 1)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    # Convert list items to an unordered list
    lines = [re.sub(r'^(- [^\n]+)', r'<li>\1</li>', line) for line in lines]
    block = '\n<ul>\n' + '\n'.join(lines) + '\n</ul>'
    return docstring, block
```

In the corrected function, we use the `re.sub` function to replace each list item with an HTML list item tag (`<li>...</li>`). Then, we wrap the modified list items with `<ul>` tags to create an unordered list. This modification should ensure that the function properly converts list items to an unordered list in the docstring.
