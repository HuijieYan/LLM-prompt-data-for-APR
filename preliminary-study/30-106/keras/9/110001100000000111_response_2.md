Potential error location: The issue seems to be in the `process_list_block` function, particularly in the logic for processing the list blocks and removing leading spaces from each line.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug may be occurring due to incorrect calculation of the ending point of the block and improper processing of the list items.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use more robust logic to identify the ending point of the block.
2. Revise the method of removing leading spaces and processing the list items.
3. Ensure that the block processing is done accurately for different types of list blocks.

Corrected code for the `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else ending_point)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    # Usually lines have at least 4 additional leading spaces.
    # These have to be removed, but first the list roots have to be detected.
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)', r'- __\1__:\2', line) for line in lines]
    # All the other lines get simply the 4 leading space (if present) removed
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ', '', line) for line in lines]
    # Fix text lines after lists
    indent = 0
    text_block = False
    processed_lines = []
    for line in lines:
        spaces = re.search(r'\S', line)
        if spaces:
            # If it is a list element
            if line[spaces.start()] == '-':
                indent = spaces.start() + 1
                if text_block:
                    text_block = False
                    processed_lines.append('\n' + line)
            elif spaces.start() < indent:
                text_block = True
                indent = spaces.start()
                processed_lines.append('\n' + line)
            else:
                processed_lines.append(line)
        else:
            text_block = False
            indent = 0
            processed_lines.append(line)
    block = '\n'.join(processed_lines)
    return docstring, block
