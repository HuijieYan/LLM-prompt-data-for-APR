Potential error location:
The code contains multiple problematic sections such as incorrect slicing and replacement of the docstring, incorrect regular expression usage, and incorrect handling of leading white spaces.

Reasons behind the bug:
1. The slicing of the docstring and replacement logic is incorrect and may result in incorrect modification of the original docstring.
2. The regular expressions used for detecting list elements and leading white spaces are not functioning as intended.
3. There are issues with handling text lines after lists and removing leading spaces.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Carefully slice and replace the docstring to ensure that the modifications are accurately made without losing any content.
2. Correct the regular expressions to accurately detect list elements and leading white spaces.
3. Fix the logic for handling text lines after lists and removing leading spaces to ensure accurate formatting.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    # Create a block with correct slicing
    block = docstring[starting_point:(ending_point if ending_point != -1 else len(docstring))]
    # Place marker for later reinjection
    docstring = docstring[:starting_point] + docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker) + docstring[section_end:]
    # Split the block into lines
    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    
    # Update the logic for handling list elements and leading spaces
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        if line.lstrip().startswith('-'):
            lines[i] = re.sub(r'^(\s*)-', r'\1- ', line)
    
    # Join the lines back into a block
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    
    return docstring, block
```
This corrected code addresses the issues with incorrect slicing, regular expressions, and handling of list elements and leading spaces. It accurately processes the input docstring and block to ensure correct formatting.
