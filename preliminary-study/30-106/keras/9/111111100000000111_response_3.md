The potential error in the `process_list_block` function seems to be related to the incorrect processing of the text block. It appears that the function is not handling the list formatting and indentation properly, resulting in the incorrect formatting of the documentation.

The bug is likely occurring because the function is not correctly identifying and handling the list elements and their indentation, leading to the improper formatting of the documentation.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly identify and handle the list elements and their indentation. The function should also properly format the text block after the lists.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else
                                      ending_point - 1)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    # Usually lines have at least 4 additional leading spaces.
    # These have to be removed, but first the list roots have to be detected.
    top_level_regex = r'^([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)'
    top_level_replacement = r'- __\1__:\2'
    lines = [re.sub(top_level_regex, top_level_replacement, line) for line in lines]
    # All the other lines get simply the 4 leading space (if present) removed
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ', '', line) for line in lines]
    # Fix text lines after lists
    indent = 0
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        spaces = re.search(r'\S', line)
        if spaces:
            if line[spaces.start()] == '-':
                text_indent = spaces.start()
                lines[i] = ' '*(text_indent-4) + line[text_indent:]
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
```

This corrected code should properly handle the list elements, their indentation, and the text block after the lists, resulting in the correct formatting of the documentation.
