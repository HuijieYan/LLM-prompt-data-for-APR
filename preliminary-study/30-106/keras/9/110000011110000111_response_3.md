The error message from the test function suggests that the formatting of the output is not as expected. It seems that the issue is with the list formatting in the docstring. The bug is likely located in the `process_list_block` function, where the formatting of the list is being manipulated. 

The reason behind the bug is that the function is incorrectly handling the formatting of the list elements in the docstring. It is not properly converting the list elements into the markdown format.

To fix the bug, the function `process_list_block` needs to correctly detect and handle the list elements in the docstring. It should convert the list items into the markdown format as expected.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else
                                      ending_point - 1)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    # Convert list elements to markdown format
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ([^\s\\\(]+):(.*?)', r'- __\1__:\2', line) for line in lines]
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
```

This corrected function should properly handle the markdown formatting for list elements in the docstring. After applying this fix, the test function should pass without any assertion errors.
