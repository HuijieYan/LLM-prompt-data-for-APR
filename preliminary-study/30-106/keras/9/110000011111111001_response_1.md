The buggy function seems to be modifying the `docstring` by replacing a specific block with a marker and then manipulating the lines within the block. The bug likely arises from incorrect manipulation of the `docstring` and `block` variables, leading to an unexpected result in the test function. The error message indicates a mismatch between the expected and actual output of the `markdown` function, highlighting an issue in the list processing logic within the `process_list_block` function.

To fix the bug, we need to first handle the `block` variable correctly by excluding the last character in the substring. Then, we should clean up the `lines` variable to ensure it is accurately represented. Additionally, it seems that the block slicing and replacement logic could be improved to ensure correct output.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else ending_point - 1)]
    
    # Place marker for later reinjection
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = docstring[:starting_point] + docstring_slice + docstring[section_end:]
    
    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]

    # List processing
    lines = [re.sub(r'^- ([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)', r'- __\1__:\2', line) for line in lines]
    lines = [re.sub(r'^  ', '', line) for line in lines]
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    
    return docstring, block
```

This should ensure that the list elements in the `block` variable are correctly processed, and the `docstring` variable is updated as expected, leading to a valid output for the test case.
