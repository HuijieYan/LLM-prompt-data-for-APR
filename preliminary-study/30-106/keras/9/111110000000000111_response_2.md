Potential error location: The error could be occurring in the `process_list_block` function due to the handling of leading white spaces and the removal of list roots.

Reasons behind the bug: The current function is not properly handling the indentation and list formatting within the docstring. This is causing the bullet points and indentation in the docstring to appear incorrectly in the generated documentation.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Correctly identify and handle the indentation and list formatting within the docstring.
2. Ensure that the leading white spaces are properly removed and that list roots are detected and formatted appropriately.

Corrected code:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else
                                      ending_point - 1)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)', r'- __\1__:\2', line) for line in lines]
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ', '', line) for line in lines]
    lines = [re.sub(r'^(-\s+)(\S)', r'\1\n    \2', line) for line in lines]  # Fix text lines after lists
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
```

In the corrected function, the replacement of list elements and the handling of leading white spaces have been adjusted to properly format the docstring with bullet points and indentation. This should resolve the issue with incorrect formatting in the generated documentation for callbacks and early stopping.
