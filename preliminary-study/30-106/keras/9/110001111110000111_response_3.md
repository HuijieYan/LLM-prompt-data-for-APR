The error seems to be in the `process_list_block` function, which is used for processing docstrings. The error message indicates that the formatting for the bullet points in the docstrings is not being handled correctly.

The reason behind the bug is that the function is not properly handling the conversion of list items to bullet points in the docstrings.

To fix this bug, the function `process_list_block` should be modified to properly handle the conversion of list items to bullet points in the docstrings. Specifically, the function should ensure that list items are correctly formatted as bullet points with proper indentation.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else ending_point - 1)]

    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])

    lines = block.split('\n')

    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]

    # Convert list elements to bullet points with correct formatting
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)', r'- __\1__:\2', line) for line in lines]
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ', '- ', line) for line in lines]

    block = '\n'.join(lines)

    return docstring, block
```

This modified code properly handles the conversion of list items to bullet points with the correct formatting.
