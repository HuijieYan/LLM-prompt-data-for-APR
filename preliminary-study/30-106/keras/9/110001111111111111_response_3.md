The bug is likely occurring in the `process_list_block` function. The function seems to be parsing a docstring and replacing a block of text with a given marker. However, the logic for identifying the end of the block and the replacement process might be incorrect, leading to the incorrect behavior seen in the test case and the associated GitHub issues.

The bug seems to be related to how the block of text is being handled, split, and replaced in the `docstring`. This results in incorrect formatting of the output as observed in the error message from the test function.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `block` and `docstring` are correctly updated to reflect the desired formatting. Additionally, handling of leading spaces and text block conditions should be reviewed to catch all edge cases.

Here's the corrected `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    # Finding the actual end point of the block
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    if ending_point == -1:
        ending_point = len(docstring)

    # Extract the block of text and replace it with the marker
    block = docstring[starting_point:ending_point]
    docstring = docstring[:starting_point] + marker + docstring[ending_point:]

    # Processing the lines in the block
    lines = block.split('\n')
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]

    # Removing additional leading spaces and handling list roots
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)', r'- __\1__:\2', line) for line in lines]
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ', '', line) for line in lines]

    # Fixing text lines after lists
    indent = 0
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        spaces = re.search(r'\S', line)
        if spaces:
            if line[spaces.start()] == '-':
                indent = spaces.start() + 1
            elif spaces.start() < indent:
                indent = spaces.start()

            if indent > 0:
                lines[i] = ' ' * indent + line

    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
```

This corrected function ensures that the `block` and `docstring` are appropriately updated and that the formatting of the output is correct. This should fix the formatting issues of the docstring observed in the test case and the associated GitHub issues.
