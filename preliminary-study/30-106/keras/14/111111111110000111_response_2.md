The error occurs in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function, which is causing the `ValueError: Shape must be rank 1 but is rank 0 for 'in_top_k/InTopKV2'` in the test function.

The bug is caused by the wrong assumption about the shape of `y_true`. The existing code assumes the shape of `y_true` is always (num_samples, 1), leading to the incorrect output. The function should check the shape of `y_true` and squeeze if applicable.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function to handle different shapes of `y_true` appropriately. We can add a conditional check to determine whether to squeeze `y_true` based on its shape.

The corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function is as follows:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true_shape = K.int_shape(y_true)
    if len(y_true_shape) > 1 and y_true_shape[-1] == 1:
        y_true = K.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)
        
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```

With this modification, the bug in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function should be fixed.
