Potential error location: The potential error in the function is in the line `axis=-1`. This line attempts to access the last axis of the tensor, but it is not clear which axis is the last axis in this context.

Reason for the bug: The bug occurs because the input tensors `y_pred` and `y_true` have different shapes, and it is not clear which axis corresponds to the categories in the input tensors.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: To fix this bug, we need to explicitly specify the axis for `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` and `K.in_top_k(y_pred, axis=-1)`, rather than relying on the default -1 argument.

The corrected code for the problematic function is:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(K.max(y_true, axis=1), 'int32'), k),
                  axis=1)
```
