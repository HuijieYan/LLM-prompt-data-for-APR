The error message indicates that there is an issue with the shape of the input while using the function `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy`. The error occurs in the `tf.nn.in_top_kv2` operation due to shape mismatch.

The potential error location within the function is the line where `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` is being used. This line assumes that the shape of `y_true` is `(num_samples, 1)`, which is causing the shape mismatch.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function does not handle the different shapes of `y_true` correctly. It assumes a specific shape, leading to a shape mismatch error.

One approach to fix the bug is to check the shape of `y_true` and apply the necessary transformations to make it compatible with the rest of the operations. If the shape is `(num_samples, 1)`, it should be left as is. If the shape is `(num_samples,)`, it should be reshaped to `(num_samples, 1)` for consistency.

Here's the corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    if K.int_shape(y_true)[-1] == 1:
        y_true = K.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```

In this corrected function, we first check the shape of `y_true`. If the shape indicates that it's in the form `(num_samples, 1)`, we simply squeeze it to convert it into a 1D array. If the shape is already `(num_samples,)`, no further transformation is needed. This correction ensures that the function can handle both shapes correctly.
