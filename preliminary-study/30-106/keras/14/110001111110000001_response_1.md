The error message indicates that the shape of the inputs to the 'in_top_k' function is causing the issue. The function is expecting a rank 1 shape, but it is receiving a rank 0 shape for the inputs.

The bug is located in the 'sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy' function, in the line that calls 'K.in_top_k'. The cause of the bug is that the 'K.max' function is being called on 'y_true' without specifying the correct dimension along which to take the maximum. This results in a rank 0 shape being passed to the 'K.in_top_k' function, causing the error.

To fix the bug, the correct axis should be specified when calling 'K.max' on 'y_true' to ensure the shape of the output is compatible with the 'in_top_k' function.

Here's the corrected code for the 'sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy' function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32'), k))
```
