The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` to calculate the maximum value along the last axis. This is leading to an incorrect output as it should directly compare with `y_true`.

The bug occurred due to incorrect calculation of the maximum value from `y_true` using `K.max` function.

To fix the bug, we need to directly compare `y_pred` with `y_true` instead of using `K.max` function. We can utilize the `K.equal` and `K.cast` functions to achieve this.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true = K.cast(y_true, 'int32')
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```
