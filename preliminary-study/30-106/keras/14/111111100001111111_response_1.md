The issue with the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function is that it assumes the shape of `y_true` to be (num_samples, 1) and always reduces in the last dimension, which leads to incorrect output. However, the shape of `y_true` can be (num_samples, 1) or (num_samples).

To fix this issue, we need to check the shape of `y_true` and squeeze it if applicable before performing any calculations.

Here's the corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true = tf.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)  # Squeeze if the shape is (num_samples, 1)
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```

In this corrected code, we first check the shape of `y_true` using `tf.squeeze` to remove the dimension of size 1. Then we proceed with the rest of the calculations. This fix addresses the issue where the function assumed the shape of `y_true` to be (num_samples, 1) and always reduced in the last dimension, leading to incorrect output.
