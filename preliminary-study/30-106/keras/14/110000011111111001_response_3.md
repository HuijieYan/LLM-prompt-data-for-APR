The potential error location within the problematic function is at the `in_top_k` function call inside the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function.

The error occurred because the `y_true` input parameter is expected to be a one-dimensional array, but it is being passed as a two-dimensional array. The `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` operation tries to find the max value along the last dimension (which is expected to be the only dimension in this case), but due to the two-dimensional nature of `y_true`, it causes shape mismatch errors.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `y_true` is always a one-dimensional array before passing it to `K.max` or any other function that expects a one-dimensional input.

The corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function is as follows:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true = K.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)  # Ensure y_true is one-dimensional
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```
