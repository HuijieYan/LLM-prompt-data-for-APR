The potential error in the buggy function is that it is using `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` to get the maximum value along the last axis, but this operation is unnecessary since `y_true` is already the one-hot encoded true labels. Additionally, the `K.cast` operation on `y_true` is also unnecessary.

The function is attempting to compute the top-k categorical accuracy for sparse targets, but the calculation is incorrect. 

To fix the function, we need to calculate the top-k accuracy for each sample in the batch. We can use `tf.nn.top_k` to get the indices of the top-k predictions and compare them with the true labels.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    top_k = tf.nn.top_k(y_pred, k)
    y_pred_top_k = top_k.indices
    y_true = tf.cast(tf.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32')
    correct_predictions = tf.cast(tf.equal(tf.expand_dims(y_true, axis=-1), y_pred_top_k), 'float32')
    return K.mean(correct_predictions, axis=-1)
```

With this corrected function, for the given test case with k=3, the function will calculate the top-3 categorical accuracy for the provided y_true and y_pred values.
