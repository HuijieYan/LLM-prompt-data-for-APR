The potential error location within the problematic function is the line where it calculates the cast of the maximum of y_true.

The bug occurs because the function assumes the shape of y_true to always be (num_samples, 1), and it always reduces in the last dimension, which leads to incorrect output. If the shape of y_true is (num_samples,), the current code does not handle it correctly.

To fix this bug, we need to check the shape of y_true and apply the appropriate operation to address both cases: when the shape is (num_samples, 1) and when it is (num_samples,).

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected function
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true_shape = K.int_shape(y_true)
    if y_true_shape[-1] == 1:  # If the shape of y_true is (num_samples, 1)
        y_true = K.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)  # Squeeze the last dimension
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```

This corrected function first checks the shape of y_true using K.int_shape and then applies K.squeeze if the shape is (num_samples, 1). Finally, it calculates the mean of the top-k categorical accuracy using K.in_top_k.
