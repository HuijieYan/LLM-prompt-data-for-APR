The potential error in the function `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` is the `K.cast(K.max(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32')` part. The error is occurring because the `K.max` and `K.cast` functions are not being used correctly for the input parameters `y_true`.

The buggy part of the code is attempting to cast the maximum value of `y_true` to an integer using `K.cast`. However, `K.max` returns the maximum value along an axis, so when using `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)`, the result is a tensor with reduced dimensionality. To fix this issue, the code needs to extract the maximum value directly from `y_true` and then cast it to an integer.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import keras.backend as K

def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true_max = tf.reduce_max(y_true, axis=-1)
    y_true_max_int = K.cast(y_true_max, 'int32')
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, y_true_max_int, k), axis=-1)
``` 

This corrected code extracts the maximum value from `y_true` using `tf.reduce_max` and then casts it to an integer using `K.cast`. This should resolve the issue and provide the expected output for the given test cases.
