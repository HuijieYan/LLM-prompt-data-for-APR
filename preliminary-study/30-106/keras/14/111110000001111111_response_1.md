The bug is likely occurring in the calculation of the mean of the top k categorical accuracy. The function is using the `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` which might not be the correct approach. It should directly compare with `y_true` instead.

The potential reason behind the bug could be the use of `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` which is not the correct approach for calculating top k categorical accuracy.

To fix the bug, the function should directly compare the predictions with the true labels without using the `K.max` method.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```
