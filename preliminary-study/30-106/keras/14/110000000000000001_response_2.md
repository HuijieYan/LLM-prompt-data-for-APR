Potential Error:
The potential error in the function is that K.max(y_true, axis=-1) is returning the maximum value in y_true along the last axis, which may not be the correct approach for this function.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because K.max(y_true, axis=-1) is not comparing the top k values as intended.

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
We need to modify K.max(y_true, axis=-1) to K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1) to get the indices of the top k elements, and then compare these indices with the predicted values.

Corrected Code:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), k))
```
