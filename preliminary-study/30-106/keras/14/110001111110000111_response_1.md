The bug is likely located in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function. The error message suggests that there is an issue with the input shapes when using `tf.nn.in_top_k`. The issue appears to be with the comparison of the predictions with the true values for sparse categorical accuracy.

The bug occurs because the current implementation assumes that the shape of `y_true` is `(num_samples, 1)`, leading to incorrect reduction in the last dimension.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to update the implementation to dynamically check the shape of `y_true` and squeeze if necessary to handle both `(num_samples, 1)` and `(num_samples,)` cases.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true = K.squeeze(y_true, -1)  # Ensure proper shape
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```

With this correction, the function will now handle both shapes of `y_true` correctly, ensuring that the bug is fixed.
