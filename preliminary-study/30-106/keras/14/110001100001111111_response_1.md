The issue with the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function is that it is using `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` where `y_true` will have shape `(num_samples,)`. This will lead to incorrect output because the last dimension will always be reduced.

To fix this issue, the function should check the shape of `y_true` and squeeze it if it has shape `(num_samples, 1)`.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/keras_14/keras/metrics.py

# this is the corrected function
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    if K.ndim(y_true) == K.ndim(y_pred):
        y_true = K.squeeze(y_true, -1)
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```
