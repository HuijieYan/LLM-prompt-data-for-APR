The error occurs in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function due to incorrectly shaping the input `y_true`. The `in_top_k` function requires the targets to have a shape of `(num_samples,)` but the current implementation does not handle this case properly.

To fix the bug, we need to check the shape of `y_true` and squeeze it if it is of shape `(num_samples, 1)`. Additionally, the `axis` parameter for `K.max` should be changed to `-1` to ensure that we are taking the maximum along the correct axis.

The correct approach is to modify the function to handle both cases of shape for `y_true` and provide the corrected code as follows:

```python
import keras.backend as K

def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true = K.squeeze(y_true, -1)  # Squeeze if y_true has shape (num_samples, 1)

    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```

By adding the `y_true = K.squeeze(y_true, -1)` line, we handle the case in which `y_true` has shape `(num_samples, 1)` correctly. Then, the corrected function is capable of handling both cases of input shapes for `y_true`.
