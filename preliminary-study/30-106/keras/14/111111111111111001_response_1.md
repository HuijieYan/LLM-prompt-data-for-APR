The error occurs in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function at this line:

```python
return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(K.max(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```

The error message indicates that the shape must be rank 1 but is rank 0 for 'in_top_k/InTopKV2' (op: 'InTopKV2') with input shapes: [2,3], [], [].

The bug is occurring because the `y_true` variable is not compatible with the `in_top_k` operation. The `y_true` variable needs to have a shape of (num_samples, 1) or (num_samples,) to be compatible with the `in_top_k` operation.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `y_true` variable has the correct shape before passing it to the `in_top_k` operation.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true = K.expand_dims(y_true, axis=-1)  # Expanding the dimensions of y_true to make it compatible with in_top_k
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(K.max(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```
