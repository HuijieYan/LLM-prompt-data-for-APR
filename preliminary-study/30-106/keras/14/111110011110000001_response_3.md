The `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function is using the Keras backend to calculate the top-k categorical accuracy. The error message indicates that there is a problem with the shape of the inputs when trying to use the `in_top_k` function.

The error message "ValueError: Shape must be rank 1 but is rank 0 for 'in_top_k/InTopKV2' (op: 'InTopKV2')" suggests that the shape of the input is not compatible with the `in_top_k` function. The input shapes are [2,3], [], [] which indicates that the issue may be related to the shape of the `y_true` input.

The bug occurs because the `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` is resulting in an empty array as the axis=-1 means the maximum value for the last dimension and because the array is 1D, it has no dimensions to take the maximum value from, resulting in an empty array which causes the error.

To fix this bug, the code should calculate the maximum value directly without specifying the axis, and then cast to 'int32' to match the data type required by the `in_top_k` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(K.max(y_true, axis=1), 'int32'), k),
                  axis=-1)
```

By making this change, the function should now correctly calculate the top-k categorical accuracy without causing the shape-related error.
