The error message indicates that there is an issue with the shape of the input tensors for the `in_top_k` function. This is likely caused by the incorrect use of the `K.max` and `K.cast` functions inside the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function. 

The bug occurs because the `K.max` function is being used over the `y_true` tensor with `axis=-1`, which means it attempts to take the maximum along the last axis. However, `y_true` is a 1D tensor, so taking the maximum along the last axis doesn't make sense and causes the error. The subsequent use of `K.cast` also exacerbates this issue.

To fix this bug, the max value of `y_true` should be computed directly using the `K.max` function without specifying the axis. Then, `K.cast` can be used to cast the returned max values.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    true_max_value = K.max(y_true)  # Compute the maximum value in y_true
    true_max_value = K.cast(true_max_value, 'int32')  # Cast the max value to int32
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, true_max_value, k), axis=-1)
```
