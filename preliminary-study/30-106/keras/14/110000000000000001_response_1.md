Potential error location: 

The potential error is in the line `K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(K.max(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32'), k)`. It seems that the use of `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` is incorrect because `y_true` is a one-hot encoded vector and `K.max` is likely being used to find the maximum value along the last axis, which would just return 1 for each sample. This is not the intended behavior.

Reasons for the bug:

The bug occurs because the function is incorrectly using `K.max` to find the maximum value along the last axis of `y_true`, which results in 1 for each sample in the one-hot encoded vector.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

To fix this bug, the function should instead use `K.argmax` to find the indices of the maximum value along the last axis of the one-hot encoded vector `y_true`.

Corrected code:

```python
# corrected function
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), k),
                  axis=-1)
```
