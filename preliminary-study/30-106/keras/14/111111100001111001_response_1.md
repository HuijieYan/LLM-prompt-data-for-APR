Potential error location: The potential error is occurring in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function at the line `K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(K.max(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32'), k), axis=-1)`. 

Reason for the bug: The error is occurring because the input parameters `y_true` and `y_pred` are of type `RefVariable` instead of the expected type, which is likely causing the incorrect computation.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Convert the `RefVariable` type to the expected type before performing any computations.
2. Ensure that the input parameters `y_true` and `y_pred` are of the correct shape and type for the function to work as intended.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from keras import backend as K

def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true = K.cast(y_true, 'int32')
    y_pred = K.cast(y_pred, 'float32')
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, y_true, k), axis=-1)
```
