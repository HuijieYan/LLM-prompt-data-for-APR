The error occurs due to the assumption made in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function. The function assumes that the input shape of `y_true` is (num_samples, 1) and always reduces in the last dimension, which leads to incorrect output when the actual shape of `y_true` is different.

To fix this bug, the code needs to be modified to check the shape of `y_true` and squeeze it if applicable. This will ensure that the function works correctly for different shapes of `y_true`.

Here's the corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    if K.int_shape(y_true)[-1] == 1:
        y_true = K.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```

This corrected code checks if the last dimension of `y_true` is 1, and if it is, it squeezes the tensor to remove that dimension before further processing. This will fix the bug and ensure that the function works correctly for different input shapes of `y_true`.
