The bug seems to be located in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function which is incorrectly using `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` instead of directly comparing the `y_true` with the predictions.

The bug occurs because the function is using `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` which is finding the maximum value along the last axis of the `y_true` tensor. This is not the correct way to calculate sparse top k categorical accuracy.

To fix the bug, we should directly compare the `y_true` with the predictions using `K.equal` and then use `K.cast` and `K.mean` to calculate the accuracy.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/keras_14/keras/metrics.py

# this is the corrected function
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true = K.cast(y_true, 'int32')  # Cast y_true to 'int32'
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, y_true, k), axis=-1)  # Use in_top_k with y_true directly
```
