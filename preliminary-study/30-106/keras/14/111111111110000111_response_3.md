The error seems to be occurring in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function due to the use of `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` which is always reducing the last dimension and not considering the shape of `y_true` which can be (num_samples, 1) or (num_samples,). This leads to the incorrect output.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the implementation of the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function to handle the different shapes of `y_true` appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    if K.int_shape(y_true)[-1] == 1:
        y_true = K.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```

In the corrected code, we first check the shape of `y_true` using `K.int_shape(y_true)[-1]`. If the last dimension is 1, we then use `K.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)` to remove the last dimension. This allows the function to handle both shapes of `y_true` appropriately and should resolve the bug.

The corrected implementation addresses the issue of handling different shapes of `y_true` and ensures that the function produces correct results for both cases.
