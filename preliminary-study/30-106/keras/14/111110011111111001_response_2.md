The error message indicates that the `in_top_k` function is receiving incorrect input shapes, specifically a rank 0 shape when it expects a rank 1 shape. This discrepancy is likely causing the function to fail.

The bug is occurring because the `in_top_k` function is not receiving the correct input shapes. This is likely due to how the `y_pred` and `y_true` variables are being processed before being passed to the `in_top_k` function.

To fix this bug, we should ensure that the inputs to the `in_top_k` function have the correct shapes. This might involve reshaping or processing the `y_pred` and `y_true` variables before passing them to the `in_top_k` function.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# Corrected function
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    targets = K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1)
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, targets, k), axis=-1)
```
