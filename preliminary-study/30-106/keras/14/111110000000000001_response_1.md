Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the function lies in the comparison between `y_pred` and `y_true`. 

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the function is not handling sparse categorical accuracy calculations correctly. 

Approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to use the built-in Keras function for calculating sparse top k categorical accuracy correctly.

Corrected code:
```python
# corrected function
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    return K.mean(K.sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k))
```
