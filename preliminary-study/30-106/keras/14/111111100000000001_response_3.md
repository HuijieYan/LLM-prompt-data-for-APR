Potential error location: The K.max(y_true, axis=-1) is likely causing the issue as it should be K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1) to get the indices of the maximum value.

Reasons for the bug:
1. The K.max function is used to get the maximum value in y_true, but what is needed instead are the indices of the maximum values.
2. The incorrect usage of K.max leads to a type mismatch as the result is expected to be int32 but it is not.

Approach for fixing the bug:
1. Replace K.max(y_true, axis=-1) with K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1) to get the indices of the maximum values.
2. Ensure that the dtype of the result matches the expected int32 type.

Corrected code:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```
