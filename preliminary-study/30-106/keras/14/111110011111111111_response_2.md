The bug in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function occurs because it assumes the shape of `y_true` is always `(num_samples, 1)`, leading to incorrect output when the shape is `(num_samples,)`. The bug occurs because the function doesn't check the shape of `y_true` and doesn't perform the necessary squeezing when applicable.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to check the shape of `y_true` and perform squeezing when the shape is `(num_samples, 1)`. This will ensure that the function produces the correct output for both shapes of `y_true`.

Here's the corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    if y_true.shape[-1] == 1:
        y_true = tf.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)
    return tf.reduce_mean(tf.cast(tf.nn.in_top_k(y_pred, y_true, k), tf.float32), axis=-1)
```

This corrected code checks the shape of `y_true` and performs squeezing when the shape is `(num_samples, 1)`, ensuring that the function works correctly for both shapes of `y_true`.
