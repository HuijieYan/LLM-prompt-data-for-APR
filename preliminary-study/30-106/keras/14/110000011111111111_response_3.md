The bug in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` method is caused by assuming the shape of `y_true` to be `(num_samples, 1)` and always reducing in the last dimension, which leads to an incorrect output. The function should check the shape of `y_true` and squeeze if applicable.

Here's the corrected `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` method:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    if y_true.shape[-1] == 1:
        y_true = tf.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```

In this corrected method, we first check the shape of `y_true` to determine if it has a shape of `(num_samples, 1)`. If this is the case, we squeeze the `y_true` tensor to remove the extra dimension.

The bug can be fixed by updating the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` method as shown above. After making this change, the associated GitHub issue titled "Fix bug in tf.keras.metrics.sparse_categorical_accuracy" is also resolved.
