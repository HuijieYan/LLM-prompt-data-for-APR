The issue is likely in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function. The bug seems to stem from the use of `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)`, which is incorrect for sparse categorical accuracy. Instead, the function should directly compare `y_pred` with `y_true`. Additionally, the `in_top_k` function itself may need to be modified to work with sparse categorical accuracy.

To fix the bug, the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function should be modified to directly compare `y_pred` with `y_true`, and potentially modify the `in_top_k` function to work properly with sparse categorical accuracy.

Here's the corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true = tf.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)  # Squeeze y_true if its shape is (num_samples, 1)
    return tf.keras.metrics.sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k)
```
