The issue with the provided function `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` is that it is using the `max` function on `y_true`, which is incorrect. Instead, it should directly compare with `y_true`. It also needs to consider the shape of `y_true` and squeeze if applicable.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from tensorflow.keras import backend as K

def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    if K.int_shape(y_true)[1] == 1:  # Check if the shape of y_true is (num_samples, 1)
        y_true = K.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)  # Squeeze y_true
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
``` 

This corrected function checks the shape of `y_true` and squeezes it if the shape is (num_samples, 1). It then uses `K.cast` to compare `y_pred` with `y_true` using `K.in_top_k` and returns the mean of it.
This function adheres to the expectations outlined in the GitHub issue descriptions.
