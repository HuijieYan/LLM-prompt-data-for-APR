The potential error in the provided function is the use of the K.mean function without explicitly specifying the axis. This can lead to issues with mismatched dimensions when calculating the mean.

The bug occurs because the K.mean function is being called without specifying the axis. This can result in mismatched dimensions when trying to calculate the mean.

To fix this bug, we need to specify the axis for the K.mean function to ensure that the mean is calculated along the correct dimension.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(K.max(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32'), k),
                  axis=1)
```

In this corrected function, we explicitly specify axis=1 for the K.mean function to ensure that the mean is calculated along the correct dimension.
