The error message indicates that there is an issue with the shape of the input data when using the `in_top_k` function. The error states "Shape must be rank 1 but is rank 0 for 'in_top_k/InTopKV2' (op: 'InTopKV2') with input shapes: [2,3], [], []", which suggests that the input shapes are not compatible with the `in_top_k` function.

Upon reviewing the function `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy`, it appears that the bug is likely due to the incorrect use of the `K.max` function. The `K.max` function is being used to find the maximum value along a certain axis, but the result is being cast to an integer using `K.cast`, which may be causing the shape mismatch.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the shapes of the inputs to the `in_top_k` function are compatible. This involves extracting the index of the top-k predictions and comparing them with the true labels.

Here's the corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true_indices = K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1)
    top_k_pred_indices = K.get_value(tf.nn.top_k(y_pred, k).indices)
    top_k_true_matches = K.cast(K.equal(K.expand_dims(y_true_indices, axis=-1), top_k_pred_indices), K.floatx())
    return K.mean(K.sum(top_k_true_matches, axis=-1), axis=-1)
```

In this corrected function, we first extract the indices of the true labels using `argmax`. Then, we use `tf.nn.top_k` to get the indices of the top-k predicted values. We compare these indices with the true labels and calculate the mean of the matches. This will ensure that the shapes of the inputs to the `in_top_k` function are compatible and should resolve the issue.
