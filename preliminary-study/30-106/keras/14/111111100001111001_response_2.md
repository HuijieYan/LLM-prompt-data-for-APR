The potential error in the provided function is that it is not using the correct comparison function to calculate the top-k categorical accuracy.

The bug occurs because the function `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` is not using correct comparison logic to calculate the top-k categorical accuracy. It is relying on `K.in_top_k` and `K.max` functions, which are not suitable for this operation.

To fix the bug, the corrected logic for calculating the top-k categorical accuracy needs to be used. This can be achieved by using `tf.nn.in_top_k` function instead.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function after fixing the bug:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    return tf.keras.metrics.sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k)
```
