The error message indicates that there is an issue with the `in_top_k` operation due to an incorrect input shape.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line that calls `K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(K.max(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32'), k)`. This line uses `y_pred` and `y_true` as inputs to the `in_top_k` operation.

The bug occurs because the `in_top_k` operation expects the input shapes to be of rank 1, but it's receiving different input shapes. This discrepancy causes the `InvalidArgumentError` and the subsequent `ValueError`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure the input shapes match the requirements of the `in_top_k` operation. We can achieve this by appropriately reshaping the input tensors to match the expected rank.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true = K.cast(y_true, 'int32')  # Ensure y_true is of type 'int32'
    y_pred = K.cast(y_pred, 'float32')  # Ensure y_pred is of type 'float32'
    y_true = K.flatten(y_true)  # Flatten y_true to make it rank 1
    num_samples = K.shape(y_true)[0]
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, y_true, k), axis=-1)
```

In this corrected code, we cast `y_true` to 'int32', `y_pred` to 'float32', and flatten `y_true` to ensure it has a rank of 1. These transformations align the input shapes with the expected input format for the `in_top_k` operation and resolve the issue.
