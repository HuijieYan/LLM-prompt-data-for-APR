The error seems to occur in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function, specifically in the `K.in_top_k` call. The error message states "Shape must be rank 1 but is rank 0 for 'in_top_k/InTopKV2'", indicating that there is an issue with the shapes of the input tensors.

The bug is likely occurring because the `K.in_top_k` function is expecting `y_pred` and `y_true` to have specific shapes, and these shapes are not being provided correctly.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to ensure that the shapes of `y_pred` and `y_true` are compatible with the requirements of the `K.in_top_k` function. This may involve reshaping the input tensors to the expected format.

Here's the corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_pred = K.reshape(y_pred, (-1, K.int_shape(y_pred)[-1]))  # Reshape y_pred to ensure it's a 2D tensor
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), k))
```

In this corrected code, the `y_pred` is reshaped to ensure it's a 2D tensor, and then the `K.in_top_k` function is used with `y_pred`, `K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1)`, and `k` as the inputs. This should address the shape mismatch causing the error.
