Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the iteration over the `self.cells` list and the conditional check for `cell.state_size`.

Reason for the bug: The bug seems to be caused by the wrong use of `cell.state_size` within the loop.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: 
1. Check if `cell.state_size` is a function and then call it to get the state size.
2. If `cell.state_size` is not a function, directly assign it to `output_dim`.

Corrected code:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell, 'state_size'):
            if callable(cell.state_size):
                output_dim = cell.state_size()
            else:
                output_dim = cell.state_size
        else:
            output_dim = input_shape[-1]  # default output_dim based on input_shape
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
