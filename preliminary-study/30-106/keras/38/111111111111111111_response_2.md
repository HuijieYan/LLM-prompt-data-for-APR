The error seems to be occurring in the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class. The `build` method is asserting that the length of the input shape should be 2, but the input shape given in the error message is `(None, 5, 8)`.

The bug in the provided function is that the `build` method for the `StackedRNNCells` class is being defined multiple times with the same function signature, which is not possible in Python. This causes the last definition of the `build` method to override the previous ones.

To fix this bug, we should remove the duplicate definitions of the `build` method within the `StackedRNNCells` class, ensuring that there is only one definition of the `build` method.

Additionally, the `build` method of the `StackedRNNCells` class should be modified to properly handle the `cells` attribute. The cell's `state_size` should be accessed with the correct attribute name and it should update the `input_shape` appropriately.

Here is the corrected code for the `build` method of the `StackedRNNCells` class:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        output_dim = cell.state_size
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

With this corrected code, the `build` method of the `StackedRNNCells` class will properly handle the cells' state sizes and update the input shape accordingly, thereby addressing the bug.
