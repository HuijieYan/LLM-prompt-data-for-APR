The error message indicates that the assertion `assert len(input_shape) == 2` in the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class is failing. This assertion is used to check if the input shape has a time axis, and it is used to be of length 3 to account for the batch size.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the incorrect handling of input shape by the `build` method.

The bug occurs because the `build` method in the provided code assumes that the input shape should be of length 2, which does not account for the batch size and the time steps. This assumption is not valid, leading to the assertion failure.

To fix this bug, the `build` method needs to check the length of the input shape for 3 instead of 2. This change will accommodate the batch size and the time steps.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    # no time axis in the input shape passed to RNN cells
    assert len(input_shape) == 3

    self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                  initializer='uniform',
                                  name='kernel')
    self.recurrent_kernel = self.add_weight(
        shape=(self.units, self.units),
        initializer='uniform',
        name='recurrent_kernel')
    self.built = True
```

By making this change, the `build` method will correctly handle the input shape and address the assertion failure.
