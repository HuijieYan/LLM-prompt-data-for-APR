This function is designed to build the stacked RNN cells by iteratively building each cell and updating the input shape. The issue with the current implementation is that the `cell.state_size` attribute is accessed outside of the `if isinstance(cell, Layer)` block, which might lead to an AttributeError if `cell` is not an instance of `Layer`.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the cells within the `self.cells` list are instances of `MinimalRNNCell` and likely subclasses of the `Layer` class.

To fix the function, we need to make sure that `cell.state_size` is accessed only if `cell` is an instance of `Layer`. Additionally, we can redesign the logic to update the input shape based on the output dimensions of the RNN cells.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0] if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__') else cell.state_size
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

In this corrected function, we first check if `cell` is an instance of `Layer`, and if so, we build the cell and update the `output_dim` based on its `state_size`. Then, we update the `input_shape` based on the calculated `output_dim`. Finally, we set `self.built` to `True` after the loop is completed.

This approach ensures that the function only accesses `cell.state_size` if `cell` is an instance of `Layer`, which should prevent potential AttributeError issues.
