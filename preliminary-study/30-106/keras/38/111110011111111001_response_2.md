The error occurs during the test for the `MinimalRNNCell` class.
The bug is in the `build` method of the `StackedRNNCells` class. The function is trying to stack a list of RNN cells and modify their input shape to prepare for the next cell. However, during the iteration, the `input_shape` is being set to a 3-tuple that causes an assertion error in the `MinimalRNNCell` class build function.

The bug occurs because in the `StackedRNNCells` build function, the input shape is being modified incorrectly. The input_shape should only be modified for the number of layers in the stack, not with any arbitrary value. 

To fix this, the function should track the cumulative effect on the input_shape for the stack of cells, making sure to modify only the first two elements of the tuple and ignoring the rest.

Here's the corrected function for the `build` method in the `StackedRNNCells` class:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    # The correct way to modify the input_shape for a stacked RNN
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
        # Only modify the first two elements of the input_shape tuple
        input_shape = input_shape[:2] + input_shape[2:]
    self.built = True
```
By making sure to modify only the first two elements of the input_shape tuple, this corrected function should eliminate the assertion error encountered during testing.
