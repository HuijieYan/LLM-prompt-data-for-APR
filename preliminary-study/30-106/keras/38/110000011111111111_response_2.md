The error occurs in the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class. The error message states that an assertion fails because the length of `input_shape` is not equal to 2 as expected.

The bug is due to the fact that the for loop inside the `build` method of the buggy function does not correctly handle the cell's state size. The logic for updating `input_shape` based on the cell state size is incorrect.

To fix this bug, we need to make sure that `input_shape` is correctly updated based on the cell's state size. This can be achieved by introducing conditional checks for `input_shape` update based on the `cell.state_size`.

Here's the corrected implementation:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        
        if input_shape[1]:
            input_shape = (None, input_shape[1], output_dim)
        else:
            input_shape = (None, output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

In the corrected code:
- We update `input_shape` based on whether it contains a second dimension. If it does, the update includes the second dimension as well.
- This modification ensures that the shape is correctly updated based on the cell's state size, which is essential for the proper function of the RNN cells.
