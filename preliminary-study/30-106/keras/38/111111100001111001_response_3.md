The bug is likely in the `build` method of the `StackedRNNCells` class. It seems to be erroneously modifying the `input_shape` variable, which can lead to incorrect dimensions when building the cells.

The bug occurs because the `build` method is not updating the `input_shape` variable correctly when looping through the cells. It uses the same `input_shape` for all cells, which is incorrect. Additionally, the `self.built` flag is not being updated correctly, as it should only be set to `True` after all cells have been built.

To fix the bug, we should update the `input_shape` for each cell separately and set `self.built` to `True` only after all cells have been built.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
