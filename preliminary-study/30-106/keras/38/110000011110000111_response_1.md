The error message indicates that the assertion `assert len(input_shape) == 2` within the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class is failing. This is because the input shape provided to the `build` method has a length of 3 (i.e., `(None, 5, 8)`), but the assertion checks for a length of 2.

The reason for this bug is that the input shape is being improperly adjusted within the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class.

To fix this bug, we need to carefully handle the input shape dimensions in the `build` method and ensure that the shape adjustment is correct.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` method:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    # Adjust the input shape to remove the time axis
    input_shape = input_shape.as_list()
    input_shape = [input_shape[0], input_shape[2]]  # Remove the time axis

    # Define the kernel and recurrent kernel weights
    self.kernel = self.add_weight(
        shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
        initializer='uniform',
        name='kernel'
    )
    self.recurrent_kernel = self.add_weight(
        shape=(self.units, self.units),
        initializer='uniform',
        name='recurrent_kernel'
    )
    self.built = True
```

In this corrected code, the input shape is first converted to a list using `input_shape.as_list()` and then adjusted to remove the time axis by selecting the first and last dimensions. This should resolve the error and allow the function to work as intended.
