Potential error location: The potential error is in the for loop inside the build method. The loop is trying to access the state_size attribute of the cell, but it's not handling the case where the cell's state_size is not iterable.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The code is assuming that the state_size attribute of the cell is always iterable, and it's not handling the case where it's not. This can lead to a TypeError when trying to access an index of a non-iterable object.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the state_size attribute is iterable before accessing its elements.
2. Handle the case where the state_size is not iterable by setting the output_dim appropriately.

Corrected code:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        
        if hasattr(cell, 'state_size') and hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
