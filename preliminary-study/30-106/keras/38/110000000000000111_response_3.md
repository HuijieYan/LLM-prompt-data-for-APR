Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the if statement where the cell's state_size is being checked.

Reason behind the bug: The bug occurs because the code does not handle the case where the cell does not have a state_size attribute.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: We need to check if the cell has the state_size attribute before accessing it, and handle the cases where it does and does not have the attribute.

Corrected code:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell, 'state_size'):  # Check if cell has the state_size attribute
            if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
                output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
            else:
                output_dim = cell.state_size
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
