The code provided is a buggy implementation of the `build` method for a recurrent neural network (RNN) cell. The error message from the test function indicates that the input shape passed to the RNN cell has a time axis, resulting in the assertion error within the `build` method.

The bug is located in the `build` method of the RNN cell, specifically in the loop that iterates over the cells and modifies the input shape. The issue arises from the assumption that there is no time axis in the input shape, leading to a mismatch with the actual input shape.

The bug can be fixed by removing the assertion that checks for the time axis in the input shape and instead handling the input shape modification properly to account for the time axis in the RNN cell.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` method of the RNN cell:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        # Adjust the input_shape if time axis is present
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

By removing the assertion and properly modifying the input shape based on the presence of the time axis, the `build` method should now handle the input shape correctly. This should resolve the assertion error encountered in the test function.
