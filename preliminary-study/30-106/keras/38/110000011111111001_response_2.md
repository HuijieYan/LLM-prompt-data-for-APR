The error occurs during the test run of the `test_minimal_rnn_cell_layer` method. The error message indicates an assertion failure within the `MinimalRNNCell` class in the build method. The `input_shape` is expected to have a length of 2, but it is actually 3.

The issue occurs due to the improper manipulation of the `input_shape` within the `build` method of the `StackedRNNCells` class. This method iterates over each cell in `self.cells` and updates the `input_shape` based on the `cell.state_size`. However, it doesn't handle the dimensions properly, resulting in an incorrect assertion failure.

To fix the bug, we need to update the way input_shape is updated and propagated through the loop, as well as determining the dimensions of input_shape based on the `output_dim` and the number of elements in input_shape.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size

        # Update input_shape dimensions based on output_dim and input_shape elements
        if len(input_shape) == 2:
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)
        else:
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)

    self.built = True
```

In this corrected code, we account for the dimensions of `input_shape` and appropriately update it based on the conditions defined. This should resolve the assertion failure and ensure proper handling of `input_shape` within the loop.
