The error occurs during the execution of the test case `test_minimal_rnn_cell_layer()`. The error is within the `MinimalRNNCell` class, specifically in the `build` method.

The bug in the provided code is in the `build` method of the `StackedRNNCells` class. The issue arises from the manipulation of the `input_shape` variable within the loop. The code overrides the `input_shape` variable at each iteration, causing it to lose its original value.

To fix the bug in the provided code, a new variable can be used to store the modified `input_shape` at each iteration. This will preserve the original `input_shape` for the next iteration.

Here is the corrected code for the `build` method of the `StackedRNNCells` class:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    modified_input_shape = input_shape
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(modified_input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        modified_input_shape = (modified_input_shape[0], modified_input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

In the corrected code, the original `input_shape` is stored in the `modified_input_shape` variable, which is then used in the subsequent iterations of the loop. This ensures that the original `input_shape` is not modified during the loop execution.
