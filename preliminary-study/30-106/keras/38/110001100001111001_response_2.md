The problem with the code is that the input_shape is modified inside the for loop, which is incorrect.

Given that cell.state_size can either be an integer or a list/tuple, the code seems to be attempting to handle both cases. However, this is not being done correctly due to the modification of the input_shape variable inside the for loop, which should not occur.

To fix this bug, the input_shape variable should not be modified and a separate variable should be used to store the updated input shape value.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    updated_input_shape = input_shape  # store the original input shape

    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(updated_input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        updated_input_shape = (updated_input_shape[0], updated_input_shape[1], output_dim)

    self.built = True
```
