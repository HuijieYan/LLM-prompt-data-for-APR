The error occurs when the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class is called with an `input_shape` that has a length of 3, leading to an assertion error. This occurs when the `recurrent.RNN` layer is applied to the list of `MinimalRNNCell` instances, resulting in the `build` method being called with an `input_shape` of length 3.

To fix this bug, the `build` method in the `MinimalRNNCell` class should be modified to handle input shape with a length of 3. It can be updated to check for the time axis `input_shape` and calculate the correct dimensions for the weights.

Additionally, the `build` method of the `StackedRNNCells` class should be modified as well because it's not properly building the cells.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# Modified code for the build method in MinimalRNNCell class
def build(self, input_shape):
    # Assert the shape contains either 2 or 3 dimensions
    assert len(input_shape) in {2, 3}
    if len(input_shape) == 3:
        # Remove the time axis if present
        input_shape = input_shape[0], input_shape[2]
    self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                  initializer='uniform',
                                  name='kernel')
    self.recurrent_kernel = self.add_weight(
        shape=(self.units, self.units),
        initializer='uniform',
        name='recurrent_kernel')
    self.built = True

# Modified code for the build method in StackedRNNCells class
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

By updating the `build` methods in both classes, we ensure that the input shapes are handled correctly and the weights are initialized appropriately during the build phase. This should resolve the assertion error and enable the functions to work as intended.
