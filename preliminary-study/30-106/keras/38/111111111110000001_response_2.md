The error occurs in the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class during the assertion `assert len(input_shape) == 2`. This assertion checks if the length of `input_shape` is 2, but the length is actually 3, leading to the AssertionError.

The bug is happening in the loop within the `build` method of the `StackedRNNCells` class. The intent of this loop is to iterate over each cell in `self.cells`, build the cell if it's an instance of `Layer`, and update `input_shape` based on the state size of the cell.

To fix this bug, the loop should be modified to consider the state size correctly, and if `cell.state_size` is an iterable (like a list or tuple), the output dimension should be set to the first element of the state size, else it should be set to the `cell.state_size` itself. Additionally, the input shape should be updated within the loop to match the output dimension of the current cell.

Here's the corrected `build` method for the `StackedRNNCells` class:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
            
        if hasattr(cell, 'state_size') and hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size

        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
        
    self.built = True
```

By using `hasattr` to check for the existence of `state_size` and then checking if it's iterable, the corrected code handles the different possibilities of `state_size` and correctly updates the `input_shape` based on the state size of each cell.
