The error occurs when the `build` method is called on the cell. The input shape `(None, 5, 8)` does not satisfy the assertion `assert len(input_shape) == 2`. This assertion is checking for the time axis in the input shape passed to RNN cells, which is expected to be 2.

The function `build` is constructing the RNN cell, and the error occurs because it is not handling the input shape correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `build` method in the `MinimalRNNCell` class to handle the input shape appropriately. Specifically, we need to extract the time axis from the input shape and use the remaining dimensions to construct the RNN cell.

Here's the corrected `build` method for the `MinimalRNNCell` class:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    # Remove the time axis from the input shape to get the actual input dimensions
    input_dim = input_shape[-1]
    
    self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(input_dim, self.units),
                                  initializer='uniform',
                                  name='kernel')
    self.recurrent_kernel = self.add_weight(
        shape=(self.units, self.units),
        initializer='uniform',
        name='recurrent_kernel')
    self.built = True
```

With this modification, the bug in the `build` method should be fixed, and the test should pass without errors.
