The error occurs due to the assertion `assert len(input_shape) == 2` in the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class. This assertion is causing an assertion error because the input shape has a length of 3 instead of 2.

The buggy code provided is attempting to build a recurrent neural network (RNN) but is not handling the input shape correctly. The input shape is expected to be a tuple with dimensions `(batch_size, timesteps, input_features)`, hence having a length of 3.

To fix this issue, the `build` method should be updated to handle the input shape properly. Additionally, the `build` method in the `StackedRNNCells` class is not correctly updating the `input_shape` for the RNN cells it contains.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic method:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        # Update the input_shape to consider the output_dim of the cell
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

In the corrected code, the method iterates through each cell in `self.cells` and builds each cell using the input_shape. Then, the `input_shape` is appropriately updated considering the `output_dim` of the cell. Finally, the `self.built` attribute is set to True.

After applying the corrections, the issue causing the assertion error should be resolved.
