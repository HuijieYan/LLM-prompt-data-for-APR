The buggy function `build` within the class `StackedRNNCells` contains several issues. The function iterates over the list of cells and updates the `input_shape` based on the `state_size` of each cell. However, this process seems flawed, as it doesn't accurately aggregate the state sizes of all cells.

The function incorrectly sets `input_shape` based on a single cell's `state_size`, which results in an inaccurate estimation. Additionally, the `self.built` flag is set to `True` at the end of the function, irrespective of the correctness of the updates made to `input_shape`.

To fix this bug, the function should iterate through all cells, accumulate their `state_size` values, and then update the `input_shape` accordingly. Afterwards, the `self.built` flag should only be set to `True` if the process completes successfully. Without this adjustment, `self.built` could be erroneously set to `True` even if the updates to `input_shape` are incorrect.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` function:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    output_dims = []
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dims.append(cell.state_size[0])
        else:
            output_dims.append(cell.state_size)
    output_dim = output_dims[-1]  # Assuming that only the last cell's output_dim should be considered
    input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
