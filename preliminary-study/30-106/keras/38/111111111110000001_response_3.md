The error message indicates that there is an assertion error in the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class. The assertion `len(input_shape) == 2` is failing, which means that the `input_shape` is expected to have a length of 2, but it actually has a length of 3.

The potential error location is within the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class. It seems that the `input_shape` is not being correctly handled, leading to an incorrect assertion.

The bug occurs because the `input_shape` should only contain information about the dimensions of the input data, but it is being constructed incorrectly in the original example, causing the assertion to fail.

To fix the bug, the `input_shape` should be manipulated correctly when constructing the RNN cell. The dimensions of the input data should be properly extracted to match the expected input shape for the RNN cell.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    # Extracting the input shape dimensions
    input_dim = input_shape[-1]
    output_dim = self.units
    # Building the kernel and recurrent_kernel weights
    self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(input_dim, output_dim),
                                  initializer='uniform',
                                  name='kernel')
    self.recurrent_kernel = self.add_weight(
        shape=(output_dim, output_dim),
        initializer='uniform',
        name='recurrent_kernel')
    self.built = True
```

In the corrected code, the `input_dim` and `output_dim` are properly extracted from the `input_shape`, and the kernel and recurrent_kernel weights are built accordingly. This should fix the bug and ensure that the `input_shape` is handled correctly in the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class.
