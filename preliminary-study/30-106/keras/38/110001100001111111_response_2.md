The buggy function `build` in the `StackedRNNCells` class seems to be iterating through each cell, building it with the input shape, and updating the input shape for the next iteration.

The error seems to be caused by the `input_shape` update within the loop. It doesn't allow for different input shapes for individual cells in the stack, which can be problematic if the cells have different input requirements.

To fix the issue, you can make the `input_shape` update conditional based on a flag, ensuring that the input shape is only updated for the first iteration.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    new_input_shape = input_shape  # Hold the original input shape
    for i, cell in enumerate(self.cells):
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(new_input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        if i < len(self.cells) - 1:  # Only update input shape if there are more cells
            new_input_shape = (new_input_shape[0], new_input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

In this corrected code, `new_input_shape` is used to hold the original input shape, and it is updated within the loop conditionally based on the number of cells. This ensures that the input shape varies based on the requirements of each cell in the stack.
