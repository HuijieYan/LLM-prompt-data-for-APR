The error occurs in the `MinimalRNNCell.build` method when it tries to validate the input shape in the assertion `assert len(input_shape) == 2`. The input shape has three dimensions instead of two, leading to the assertion error.

This is happening because when the `StackedRNNCells` class calls the `build` method of the RNN cell instances, it is passing an input shape with three dimensions instead of two. This input shape has been modified within the `StackedRNNCells.build` method, leading to the discrepancy.

To fix this, it's necessary to adjust the input shape properly within the `StackedRNNCells.build` method before passing it to the RNN cell instances.

The corrected code for the `StackedRNNCells.build` method is as follows:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        
        # Adjust the input shape to have two dimensions
        modified_input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[2])  
        
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        modified_input_shape = (modified_input_shape[0], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

By properly modifying the input shape to have two dimensions before passing it to the RNN cell instances, the assertion error in the `MinimalRNNCell.build` method will be resolved.
