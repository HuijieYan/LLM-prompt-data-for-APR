```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

The reason for the assertion error is that the input_shape is being modified within the loop, and subsequently, additional dimensions are being added, leading to a mismatch with the expected input shape for the RNN cells. 

The corrected code should track the changed input_shape separately within the loop without modifying the original input_shape. Here's the corrected function:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        modified_input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
