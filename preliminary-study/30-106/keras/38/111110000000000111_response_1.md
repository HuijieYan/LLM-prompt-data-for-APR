Error:
The build method in the StackedRNNCells class has a bug where it iterates through the cells and updates the input_shape variable within the loop, which may lead to incorrect input_shape for subsequent cells.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug exists because the input_shape is being updated within the for loop, potentially causing unexpected results for subsequent cells.

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
We should update the input_shape only after iterating through all the cells to ensure that the correct input_shape is used for each cell.

Corrected code:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    output_dim = input_shape[-1]
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
    input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
