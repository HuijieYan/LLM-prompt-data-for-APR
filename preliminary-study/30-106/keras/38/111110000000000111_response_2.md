Potential error location: 

The potential error in the provided function is in the loop that iterates over the cells and updates the input_shape. The logic for updating the input_shape based on the state_size of the cells seems to be incorrect and can lead to issues.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:

The bug occurs because the code is incorrectly updating the input_shape based on the state_size of the cells. This can lead to incorrect shapes being propagated through the network, leading to runtime errors or incorrect behavior.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to iterate over the cells and accumulate the output_dim from each cell, and then update the input_shape based on the accumulated output_dim. This would ensure that the input_shape is correctly updated based on the state_size of the cells.

Corrected code:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    output_dim_accumulated = 0
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim_accumulated += cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim_accumulated += cell.state_size

    input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim_accumulated)
    self.built = True
```
