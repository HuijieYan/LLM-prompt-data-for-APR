The error occurs when the function `build` is called with an `input_shape` argument that has an additional dimension. The assertion `assert len(input_shape) == 2` is failing because `input_shape` has three dimensions instead of two.

The bug occurs because the `input_shape` is being modified in an unintended manner, adding an extra dimension during each iteration. This is due to the line `input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)`, which always adds an extra dimension to `input_shape`.

To fix this bug, the modification of `input_shape` needs to be revised. The addition of the extra dimension must be avoided, and `input_shape` should only be updated when it is actually modified by the cell.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` function:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
            if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
                output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
            else:
                output_dim = cell.state_size
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

In this corrected code, the update of `input_shape` occurs only within the conditional block where the cell's state size is examined. This ensures that the modification of `input_shape` is only performed when necessary, preventing the unintentional addition of an extra dimension.
