The error message is indicating that the code is trying to access a state at index 0 in the shape tuple, which is not valid. This suggests that the issue might be in the implementation of the `build` method in the `MinimalRNNCell` class.

The potential error location is the line where the `assert` statement is used within the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class.

The error occurs because the input shape being checked for the time axis (necessary for RNN cells) doesn't match the expected shape. The error is occurring due to the presence of the time dimension in the input shape, which is a mismatch.

To fix this, the code needs to accommodate varying input shapes, including the time axis for RNN cells. It may require modifying the logic to handle the time axis in the input shape.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` method in the `MinimalRNNCell` class:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    # Validate input_shape to allow for the presence of the time axis
    if len(input_shape) < 2:
        raise ValueError("Input shape should have at least 2 dimensions, including the time axis.")

    # Proceed with the rest of the build logic
    self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                  initializer='uniform',
                                  name='kernel')
    self.recurrent_kernel = self.add_weight(
        shape=(self.units, self.units),
        initializer='uniform',
        name='recurrent_kernel')
    self.built = True
```

This updated code checks the input shape to ensure it contains at least 2 dimensions, including the time axis, and raises a ValueError if it doesn't. If the input shape is valid, the build logic continues as before.
