The issue in the provided code is with the `build` method in the `StackedRNNCells` class. The `build` method is supposed to iterate over the cells in the list, build each cell, and then update the input_shape based on the output_dim of each cell, but it fails to handle the state_size properly, leading to incorrect output_dim calculation.

The error occurs because the condition `if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__')` is used to determine if `state_size` is a list-like object or not, but the correct way to check if `state_size` is iterable is `if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__') and not isinstance(cell.state_size, int)`, which avoids including integers as a valid state_size, as they have a defined `__len__` attribute.

To fix the bug, update the condition for checking `state_size` to ensure that it is iterable and handle a list of state sizes if present.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__') and not isinstance(cell.state_size, int):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
