The error message is indicating an assertion failure within the `MinimalRNNCell` class, specifically within the `build` method. The assertion `assert len(input_shape) == 2` is failing, which means that the input shape has a length of 3 instead of the expected 2.

The reason behind this bug is that the shape of the input is being modified incorrectly within the `build` method of the `StackedRNNCells` class. The `build` method is intended for creating the weights of the layer. However, the faulty code is modifying the input shape in a way that is causing issues for the subsequent build methods of the RNN cells.

To fix this bug, the modification of the input shape in the `StackedRNNCells` class should be removed. The input shape should not be altered within this method, as it causes unexpected behavior when passing it to the `build` method of the RNN cells.

Here's the corrected code for the `StackedRNNCells` class:

```python
class StackedRNNCells(Layer):
    """
    Wrapper allowing a stack of RNN cells to behave as a single cell.

    Used to implement efficient stacked RNNs.

    # Arguments
        cells: List of RNN cell instances.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def build(self, input_shape):
        for cell in self.cells:
            if isinstance(cell, Layer):
                cell.build(input_shape)
        self.built = True
```

By removing the modification of the input shape and simply looping through the cells to build them, the bug should be resolved.
