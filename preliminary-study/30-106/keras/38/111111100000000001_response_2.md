Potential Error Location: The potential error is occurring in the for loop inside the `build` function of the `StackedRNNCells` class.

Reasons for the Bug: The code is attempting to update the `input_shape` variable inside the for loop, but it is not handling previous iterations' `input_shape` properly. This is causing the `input_shape` to be updated incorrectly, leading to a wrong final `input_shape`.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Create a new variable to store the updated `input_shape` in each iteration of the for loop to avoid overwriting the original `input_shape`.
2. Handle the `input_shape` update in a way that reflects the nested nature of the RNN cells being stacked.

```python
# Corrected function
def build(self, input_shape):
    new_input_shape = input_shape
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(new_input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        new_input_shape = (new_input_shape[0], new_input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
