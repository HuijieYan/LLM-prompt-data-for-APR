The error occurs in the `build` method of the `StackedRNNCells` class. This method is used to build the stacked RNN cells.

The logic inside the `build` method has an issue with determining the `output_dim` of the cells. The output dimension is being calculated based on the dimension of the state, and in some cases, it's not being calculated correctly.

To fix the bug, the correct approach would be to update the logic for calculating the `output_dim` based on the actual input shape and the type of cell. Additionally, the logic for checking the state size should be corrected to avoid the issue.

Below is the corrected code for the `build` method:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    output_dim = 0
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell, 'state_size'):
            if isinstance(cell.state_size, (list, tuple)):
                output_dim += cell.state_size[0]
            else:
                output_dim += cell.state_size
    self.built = True
```

With this correction, the `output_dim` is calculated by iterating through the cells and summing up their state sizes. This ensures that the correct `output_dim` is calculated based on the actual input shape and the type of cell.
