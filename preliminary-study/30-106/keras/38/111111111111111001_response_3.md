The error occurs when the function `build` in the `MinimalRNNCell` class raises an assertion error for the input shape not having a length of 2. This error originates from the fact that the input shape provided to the cell has a length of 3 instead of 2.

This discrepancy in the input shape length is likely due to the way the input is being processed in the `StackedRNNCells` class within the `keras.layers.recurrent` module. Specifically, the `build` method for `StackedRNNCells` is modifying the input shape in a way that adds an additional dimension (changing from 2 to 3).

One possible approach to fixing this issue is to ensure that the input shape is correctly modified within the `build` method of the `StackedRNNCells` class. The modifications should be made in a way that preserves the necessary dimensions for the input shape and does not cause it to expand unexpectedly.

Here is the corrected `build` method for the `StackedRNNCells` class:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        # Update the input shape with the correct output dimension
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

In this corrected method, the input shape is updated by replacing the second element with the output dimension, ensuring that the expected processing by the `MinimalRNNCell` class occurs without causing assertion errors.
