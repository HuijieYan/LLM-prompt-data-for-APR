Potential error location: The issue is with the loop that iterates through each cell in the list `self.cells` and tries to build each cell using `cell.build(input_shape)`.

Reasons behind the bug: The issue is that the code is trying to access the state_size attribute of the cell and determine the output_dim based on that. However, the way it is checking for the state_size attribute is incorrect, and it may not always provide the correct output_dim.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Check if the cell has the `state_size` attribute and then handle it appropriately to determine the `output_dim`.
2. Use a try-except block to handle the AttributeError if `state_size` is not present in the cell.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        try:
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0] if hasattr(cell, 'state_size') and hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__') else cell.state_size
        except AttributeError:
            output_dim = cell.units
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
