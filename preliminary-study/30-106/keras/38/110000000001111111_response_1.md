The bug occurs in the `build` method due to the incorrect ordering of the conditions inside the for loop. This results in `output_dim` being calculated incorrectly.

To fix the bug, the conditions inside the for loop need to be reordered such that `output_dim` is calculated correctly for each `cell`.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
            output_dim = cell.state_size  # move the output_dim calculation here
            if hasattr(output_dim, '__len__'):  # check output_dim for length
                output_dim = output_dim[0]
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
