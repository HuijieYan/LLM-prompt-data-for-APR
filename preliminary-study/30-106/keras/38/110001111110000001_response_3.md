The error is occurring in the `MinimalRNNCell` class during the `build` method. It is failing the assertion `assert len(input_shape) == 2` because the `input_shape` has a length of 3, not 2.

The bug in the `build` method of the `RNN` class is that it is not updating the `input_shape` properly when iterating over the `cells`. 

To fix this bug, we need to calculate the correct `input_shape` by accounting for the output dimensions of each cell in the loop and updating the input_shape for the next iteration.

Here's the corrected code with the bug fixed:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)  # update the input_shape based on the output dimension
    self.built = True
```

With this fix, the `input_shape` is correctly updated based on the output dimension of each cell, resolving the bug that caused the assertion error.
