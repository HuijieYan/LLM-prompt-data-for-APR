The potential error in the `build` method is that the variable `input_shape` is being modified in a loop without any clear purpose. It seems that the intention is to update the `input_shape` based on the `state_size` of the RNN cells. However, this is not implemented correctly.

The bug occurs because the `input_shape` is being updated in the loop without properly taking into account the cumulative effect of each RNN cell's state size on the input shape.

To fix the bug, you can update the `build` method as follows:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
            
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
            
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
        
    # Also need to specify the output_shape attribute
    self.output_shape = input_shape
    self.built = True
```

By updating the `input_shape` with the cumulative effect of each RNN cell's state size and also setting the `output_shape` attribute, this should fix the bug.
