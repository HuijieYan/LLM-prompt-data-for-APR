The error occurs in the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class. The `assert len(input_shape) == 2` is failing because the input shape is actually a 3-dimensional tuple, not a 2-dimensional one.

The bug occurs because the input shape has an additional dimension representing the batch size. Therefore, the length of the input shape is actually 3, not 2.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `build` method to handle the input shape correctly. Additionally, we can also add logic to handle the special case when `cell.state_size` has a length greater than 1.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` method:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    # Remove the batch size dimension from the input shape
    input_shape = input_shape[1:]

    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)

        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            # Handle the case when cell.state_size has a length greater than 1
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)

    self.built = True
```

With these modifications, the `build` method should now handle the input shape correctly and avoid the assertion error encountered in the test case.
