The bug seems to be in the `build` method of the `StackedRNNCells` class. The function is intended to build a stacked RNN cell based on the input shape provided. However, the bug in the function is that it is not accurately updating the `input_shape` variable within the loop, which may lead to incorrect dimensions in the subsequent layers.

To fix this bug, we can update the `input_shape` variable within the loop to ensure that it reflects the correct dimensions based on the `cell.state_size`.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` method:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

In the corrected code, we update the `input_shape` variable within the loop based on the `output_dim` calculated from `cell.state_size`. This ensures that the dimensions are correctly propagated through the stacked RNN cells.
