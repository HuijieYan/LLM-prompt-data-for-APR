The error message is related to the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class. The error occurs because the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class is expecting the input shape to have 2 dimensions, but the actual input shape has 3 dimensions.

The bug in the `MinimalRNNCell` class's `build` method is not directly related to the `StackedRNNCells` class. However, it is impacting the `stacking` test case, which in turn causes the error to manifest.

To fix the bug, the `MinimalRNNCell` class's `build` method should be modified to handle input shapes with 3 dimensions. This can be achieved by modifying the assertion to check for the length of input_shape when it has 3 dimensions.

Here's the corrected code for the `MinimalRNNCell` class's `build` method:

```python
class MinimalRNNCell(keras.layers.Layer):
    # ... (other code remains the same)

    def build(self, input_shape):
        # check for the length of input_shape
        if len(input_shape) != 3:
            raise ValueError("Input shape must have 3 dimensions")

        self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                      initializer='uniform',
                                      name='kernel')
        self.recurrent_kernel = self.add_weight(
            shape=(self.units, self.units),
            initializer='uniform',
            name='recurrent_kernel')
        self.built = True
```

By modifying the `build` method in the `MinimalRNNCell` class, the input shape with 3 dimensions will be handled correctly, and the error in the test case should be resolved.
