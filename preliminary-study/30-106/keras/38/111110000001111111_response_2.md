Potential error location: The bug is likely in the loop within the `build` function of the `StackedRNNCells` class. The function is intended to iterate through each cell in `self.cells` and adjust the `input_shape` based on each cell's `state_size`. However, it incorrectly sets `input_shape` to `(input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)` in each iteration, potentially overwriting the changes made in previous iterations.

Reasons behind the bug: 
1. The `input_shape` variable is being reassigned in each iteration, which may not be intentional.
2. The logic for updating `input_shape` based on `state_size` is not implemented correctly.

Possible approaches to fix the bug:
1. Ensure that `input_shape` is updated based on `state_size` without overwriting the changes from previous cells.
2. Consider implementing a more robust logic to calculate the modified `input_shape` based on the `state_size` of each cell.

Corrected code for the `build` function:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        # Adjust the input_shape based on this cell's output_dim
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
