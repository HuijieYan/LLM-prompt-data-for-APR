The potential error in the provided code lies in the 'build' method of the StackedRNNCells class. The issue is in the logic for updating the 'input_shape' variable inside the for loop. It seems like the intention is to update the 'input_shape' based on the 'state_size' of each cell, but the logic is incorrect and could lead to unexpected results.

One approach to fix the bug would be to properly update the 'input_shape' based on the 'state_size' of each cell. Additionally, the logic for handling state_size should be improved to account for different cases, such as when state_size is an integer or a list.

Here's the corrected code for the 'build' method:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell, 'state_size'):
            state_size = cell.state_size
            if hasattr(state_size, '__len__'):
                output_dim = state_size[0]
            else:
                output_dim = state_size
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the 'state_size' attribute exists for the cell. Then, we handle the case when 'state_size' is a list or a single value, updating the 'output_dim' accordingly. Finally, we update the 'input_shape' based on the 'output_dim' before marking the layer as 'built'.
