The issue with the given function is that it does not correctly handle the `state_size` attribute of the `cell` objects. The function also sets `self.built` to `True` at the end, but it doesn't seem like it does that correctly. 

It seems that the `build` function should be responsible for creating the weights of the cell. After calling `build`, the function should set the attribute `self.built = True`.

Potential error location: 
The issue might be related to the if statements for checking if `cell` is an instance of `Layer` and checking the length of `cell.state_size`. Also, the update to `input_shape` seems to be incorrect.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The function incorrectly handles the `state_size` attribute of the `cell` objects, leading to incorrect updates of `input_shape` and `self.built`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that `cell.build(input_shape)` is called for every `cell` to correctly build the weights.
2. Place the update for `input_shape` appropriately to reflect the correct output dimensions.
3. Update `self.built` at the correct location, based on the successful execution of `build` for all cells.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
