Potential error location:
The issue seems to be with the condition `if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):` as it is not checking the state_size attribute correctly.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The condition `if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):` is not checking if the `state_size` attribute is a list or has length, but rather checking if the attribute itself has a length property.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
We need to check if the `state_size` attribute is iterable using `isinstance(cell.state_size, (list, tuple))` instead of checking for the presence of a `__len__` property.

Corrected code:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell, 'state_size') and isinstance(cell.state_size, (list, tuple)):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
