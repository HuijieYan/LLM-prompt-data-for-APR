The bug occurs in the `build` method of the `StackedRNNCells` class. In this method, the `build` method of each cell in the `cells` list is called, and then the `state_size` attribute of the cell is checked to determine the `output_dim`. This is incorrect because the `state_size` attribute should be accessed after calling the `build` method on the cell.

To fix this bug, the `build` method of each cell should be called first, and then the `state_size` attribute should be used to determine the `output_dim`.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` method:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
    # Determine the output_dim based on the state_size after calling build on the cell
    output_dim = cell.state_size[0] if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__') else cell.state_size
    # Update the input_shape based on the determined output_dim
    input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

With this correction, the `build` method first calls the build method on each cell in the `cells` list and then determines the `output_dim` based on the `state_size` attribute after the cells have been built. Finally, it updates the `input_shape` and sets `self.built` to `True`.
