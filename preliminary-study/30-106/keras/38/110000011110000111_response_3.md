The error occurs in the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class, which is a subclass of `keras.layers.Layer`. The error message indicates that there is an assertion error at line 10 of the `build` method, where it checks the length of `input_shape`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the length of `input_shape` is not as expected. The `input_shape` expected is a tuple with only two elements, but in this case, it has three elements.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `build` method to handle the input shape properly.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    if len(input_shape) == 3:
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[2])
    # no time axis in the input shape passed to RNN cells
    assert len(input_shape) == 2

    self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                  initializer='uniform',
                                  name='kernel')
    self.recurrent_kernel = self.add_weight(
        shape=(self.units, self.units),
        initializer='uniform',
        name='recurrent_kernel')
    self.built = True
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the length of `input_shape` is 3 (indicating a time dimension), and if so, we modify `input_shape` to remove the time dimension. Then we proceed with the rest of the `build` method as before.

This change should handle the input shape properly and resolve the assertion error.
