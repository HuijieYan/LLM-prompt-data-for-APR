The error occurs because the code attempts to subtract a mean value from an integer array, which leads to a UFuncTypeError. This error is caused by the fact that the mean values are defined as float arrays, and the input x is cast to an integer array (xint) in the test function. When attempting to subtract a float from an integer, a typecasting error arises.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the mean values are of the same type as the input x. This can be achieved by casting the mean values to the same type as the input x (xint in the test function) before performing the subtraction operation.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.
