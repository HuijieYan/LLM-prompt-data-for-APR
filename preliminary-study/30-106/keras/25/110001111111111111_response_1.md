The error occurs because the subtraction operations in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function are trying to subtract a floating point array from an integer array. This mismatch in data types is causing the error.

To fix this issue, we can ensure that the input array `x` is of the `float` data type before performing the division and subtraction operations. This can be achieved by using the `astype` method to convert `x` to `float` before applying the operations.

Here's the corrected code for the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """

    x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert input array to float

    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.

```

This corrected code ensures that the input array `x` is of the `float32` data type, so that the division and subtraction operations can be performed without causing any data type mismatch.
