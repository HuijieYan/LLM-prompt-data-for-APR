The bug occurs in the function `_preprocess_numpy_input` in the lines for the 'tf' mode and 'torch' mode. In the 'tf' mode, the function should be scaling the pixels between -1 and 1 sample-wise. Similarly, in the 'torch' mode, the function should be scaling the pixels between 0 and 1 and then normalizing each channel with respect to the ImageNet dataset. However, the calculations for these two modes are not done correctly in the existing function.

To fix the bug, we should update the function to correctly handle the 'tf' mode and 'torch' mode as described in the comments.

Here's the corrected code for the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        return (x - mean) / std
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

        # Zero-center by mean pixel
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x[0] -= mean[0]
                x[1] -= mean[1]
                x[2] -= mean[2]
            else:
                x[:, 0] -= mean[0]
                x[:, 1] -= mean[1]
                x[:, 2] -= mean[2]
        else:
            x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
            x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
            x[..., 2] -= mean[2]

        if std is not None:
            x /= std

    return x
```
