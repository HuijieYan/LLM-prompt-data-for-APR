The error message indicates that there is an issue with data types during the subtraction operation. The error occurs in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function at the line `x[..., 0] -= mean[0]`. This error arises because the input `x` has a data type of `int32` and the `mean` values have a data type of `float64`. This causes a data type mismatch during the subtraction.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle the data type of the input `x` properly. It assumes that the input will always be of float type and does not account for the possibility of integer inputs.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the data type of `x` is converted to float before performing operations involving floating-point numbers.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

        Preprocessed Numpy array.
