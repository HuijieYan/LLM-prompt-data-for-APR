Potential error:
The potential error location within the problematic function is the incorrect handling of the 'torch' mode. It is missing the step to subtract mean and divide by standard deviation, which is necessary for preprocessing the input data in 'torch' mode.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurred because the preprocessing steps for the 'torch' mode were not properly implemented in the function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add the steps to subtract mean and divide by standard deviation for the 'torch' mode.
2. Ensure that the preprocessing steps for each mode are implemented correctly and consistently.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
# Corrected function
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

        Preprocessed Numpy array.
