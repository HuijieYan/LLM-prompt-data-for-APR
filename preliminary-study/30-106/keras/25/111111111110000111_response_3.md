The error occurs in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function when the input mode is set to 'torch' and the input data format is set to 'channels_last'. This causes difficulties in handling the data type conversion and subtraction operations.

The bug originates from the failure to account for different data types, specifically when the input mode is 'torch' and the data format is 'channels_last'. The code should be modified to handle data type conversion more carefully and account for the differences in data formats and modes.

The bug can be fixed by explicitly converting the input array to float before performing subtraction operations and addressing the differences in data formats and modes.

Here's the corrected code for the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.

        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
