The error message indicates that the subtraction operation is trying to cast the output from dtype('float64') to dtype('int32'), which is not allowed. This suggests that the code is working with different data types for the input and the expected output, leading to a mismatch during subtraction.

The potential error location is likely within the conditional branches for the data format and mode handling, specifically where the mean values are subtracted from the input array.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle input data types properly when performing the subtraction operations. When the input data type is 'int32', it tries to subtract a float value from it, resulting in a casting error.

To fix this bug, we can perform the subtraction operation with arrays of matching data types. If the input data type is 'int32', we should convert the mean values to int32 before subtracting them from the input array.

Here's the corrected code for the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

        Preprocessed Numpy array.
