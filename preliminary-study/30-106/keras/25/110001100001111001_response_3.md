The bug in the provided function is that it checks for the `mode` variable value and performs operations accordingly, but it does not return the preprocessed array as intended for the other modes ('caffe' and 'torch'). As a result, it returns the original array without any preprocessing.

To fix this bug, the function should preprocess the input array based on the specified mode and then return the preprocessed array. The operations performed by the function for the different modes are as follows:
1. For 'tf' mode: Scale pixels between -1 and 1, sample-wise. 
2. For 'torch' mode: Scale pixels between 0 and 1 and normalize each channel with respect to the ImageNet dataset.
3. For 'caffe' mode: Convert the images from RGB to BGR, then zero-center each color channel with respect to the ImageNet dataset, without scaling.

To address the bug, the corrected function/method is as follows:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
