The bug occurs in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function due to a data type mismatch. The function is trying to subtract a list `mean` from the array `x`, which causes a data type conflict. The cause of the bug is the assignment of `mean` as a list of floats. This conflicts with the data type of the input `x`, which is an array of integers for the 'int32' type.

To fix this bug, the `mean` values should be cast into the same data type as the input array `x` to avoid data type conflicts during subtraction.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.

    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], dtype=x.dtype)
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225], dtype=x.dtype)

                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
