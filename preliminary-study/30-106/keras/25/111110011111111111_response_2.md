The error message indicates that there is an issue with the data type conversion. The error occurs when trying to subtract the mean value from the input `x`, which is of type int32. The numpy library does not allow subtraction of float values from int32 arrays due to data type incompatibility.

The bug is located in the section where the mean is subtracted from the input array `x`, specifically for the case when the `data_format` is not 'channels_first'.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the data type of `x` is consistent with the data type of the mean values and perform the operations accordingly.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
