The error message indicates an issue with the data types when subtracting the mean values from the input array `x` in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function. The error specifically mentions that it cannot cast the output from dtype('float64') to dtype('int32').

This error occurs because the input array `x` is of type 'int32', and when performing operations like subtraction and division, it should be converted to 'float64' for the calculations. However, this conversion is not being handled properly in the original function, leading to the data type mismatch and the subsequent error.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the input array `x` is converted to 'float64' before performing any arithmetic operations on it. This will prevent type casting issues and ensure correct calculations.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.
