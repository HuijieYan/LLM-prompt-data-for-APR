The potential error in the function is at the beginning of the `mode` conditional statements where it checks if `mode` is 'tf' or 'torch'. 

The bug occurs because if `mode` is not equal to 'tf' or 'torch', the function attempts to access `mean` and `std` without defining them, which causes an error.

To fix the bug, we should define `mean` and `std` for the 'caffe' mode and also handle the case where `mode` is not one of the specified options.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.

        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
