The bug occurs in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function. It seems that the bug is caused by the division operation involving the `x` array, which is of type `int32`. The division is performed with floating-point values, which results in a type error when operating with the `int32` type.

To fix this bug, we can ensure that the input array `x` is converted to a floating-point type before performing division operations on it.

Here's the corrected code for the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert to floating-point type

    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406])
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68])
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        x -= mean.reshape(1, -1, 1, 1)
        if std is not None:
            x /= std.reshape(1, -1, 1, 1)
    else:
        x -= mean
        if std is not None:
            x /= std

    return x
```

In the corrected code:
1. We explicitly convert the input array `x` to float type using `x.astype('float32')`.
2. We also changed the `mean` to a numpy array and used broadcasting for the division operation.

These changes ensure that the division is performed with floating-point values and the correct type of arrays, addressing the type error that occurred in the previous implementation.
