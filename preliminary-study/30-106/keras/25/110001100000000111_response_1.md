The potential error in the function is in the 'if mode == 'torch'' block. In this block, the mean and std variables are assigned, but they are not used to preprocess the input array 'x'.

The bug occurs because the mean and std variables are defined but not applied to the input array 'x' in the 'if mode == 'torch'' block.

To fix the bug, we need to use the mean and std variables to preprocess the input array 'x' in the 'if mode == 'torch'' block. We can apply the normalization and centering operations using these variables.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        x = (x - mean) / std
        return x
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        x -= mean

        return x
```

In the corrected code, the mean and std variables are applied to the input array 'x' in the 'if mode == 'torch'' block using the normalization and centering operations.
