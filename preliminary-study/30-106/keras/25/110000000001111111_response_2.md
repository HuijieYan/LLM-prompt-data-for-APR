The bug occurs in the section of the function that handles the 'caffe' and default modes. The bug is due to the mishandling of the color channel means and the scaling factors. 

In the 'caffe' mode, when the data format is 'channels_first', the function incorrectly subtracts the mean and divides by the standard deviation for each color channel at the beginning, without checking for the mode. 

To fix the bug, we need to restructure the code to handle the 'caffe' mode correctly and ensure that the mean and standard deviation are applied appropriately based on the mode and data format.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = (x / 127.5) - 1
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x = x / 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        x = (x - mean) / std
    elif mode == 'caffe':
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        x -= mean
    return x
