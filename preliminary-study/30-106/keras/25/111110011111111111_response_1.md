The error occurs because the function attempts to perform arithmetic operations on an array of integers, resulting in a data type mismatch error.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all arithmetic operations are consistent with the data type of the input array.

Here's the corrected code for the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.

    x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert input to float32 to ensure consistent data type for arithmetic operations

    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.

```

In the corrected code, we explicitly convert the input array `x` to float32 at the beginning of the function to ensure that all subsequent arithmetic operations are performed using consistent data types. This prevents any potential data type mismatch issues.
