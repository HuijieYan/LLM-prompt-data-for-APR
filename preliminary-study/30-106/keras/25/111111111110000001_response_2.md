The error occurs at this line in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:
```python
x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
```
The error is due to the fact that the variable `x` is of type `int32`, and when trying to subtract a `float64` value from it (which is the type of `mean[0]`), the operation cannot be performed because the resulting type would be different from the original type of `x`.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the type of `x` allows for the subtraction to be performed. We can achieve this by converting `x` to a floating point type before performing the subtraction.

Corrected `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.
