The issue in the provided function is that the division and subtraction operations are not handled properly for different cases of the 'mode' parameter. Additionally, the mean and std are being used without proper checking, leading to potential errors.

The bug is occurring because the `mode` variable is currently checked only for 'tf' and 'torch' modes, with no 'else' condition defined. This results in an incorrect calculation when the mode is not 'tf' or 'torch'. The function also needs to handle both 'channels_first' and 'channels_last' cases properly for the given input.

To fix the bug, we need to do the following:
1. Maintain consistency in operations across all branches of 'mode' and 'data_format'.
2. Handle 'channels_first' and 'channels_last' cases for each mode.
3. Add proper checks for scaling and channel normalization when applying the operations based on the mode.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x = x[:, ::-1, ...]  # 'RGB'->'BGR'
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]  # 'RGB'->'BGR'
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    x -= mean

    if std is not None:
        x /= std

    return x
```

This corrected function handles all modes and data formats effectively, ensuring consistent preprocessing of the input array.
