Potential Error Location:
The error is occurring within the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function, specifically in the `else` block when `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch' and the `data_format` is not 'channels_first'. The error is caused by the attempt to subtract mean values from the input array `x`, which is of integer type, resulting in a casting error when performing the subtraction.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the input array `x` is of integer type (int32), and the code attempts to perform arithmetic operations involving floating point values (mean and std values), resulting in a type casting error.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Convert the input array `x` to floating point type before performing the arithmetic operations.
2. Ensure that correct conversions are made between data types to avoid casting errors.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.
