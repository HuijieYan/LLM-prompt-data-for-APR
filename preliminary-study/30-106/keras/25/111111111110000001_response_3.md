The bug is occurring in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function in the `keras/applications/imagenet_utils.py` file when the `mode` is set to 'caffe' or not specified. This causes an error when trying to perform operations on the input.

The error message shows that the code is trying to subtract a value from an array of dtype 'int32', resulting in a UFuncTypeError. This error occurs because the mean values and the input 'x' have different data types, leading to the error when performing operations on them.

To fix this bug, we can modify the code to ensure that all intermediate computations within the function are performed using the same data type. This can be achieved by casting the array to float before performing operations involving the mean values. Additionally, we should also handle the case when the mode is not specified.

Here's the corrected code for the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode='caffe'):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.
