Potential Error Location:
The division by a scalar value and subtraction operation for the 'tf' mode is not consistent with the other preprocessing steps for the 'caffe' and 'torch' modes.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The preprocessing steps for the 'tf' mode involve dividing by 127.5 and then subtracting 1 from the entire input array. This is not in line with the preprocessing steps for the 'caffe' and 'torch' modes.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the same preprocessing approach should be applied for the 'tf' mode as for the 'caffe' and 'torch' modes. This means implementing the preprocessing steps as specified for the 'tf' mode (scaling pixels between -1 and 1, sample-wise) consistently.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    if std is not None:
        x /= std
    x -= mean
    return x
```
