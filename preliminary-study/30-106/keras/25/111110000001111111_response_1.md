The function is not correctly handling the different modes ('caffe', 'tf', 'torch') for preprocessing the input array. The bug arises from the incorrect order or absence of operations for different modes and different data formats. The preprocessing logic needs to be adjusted to correctly handle the input array based on the mode and data format.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated to handle the different modes and data formats separately. For 'tf' mode, scaling and normalization should be performed. For 'torch' mode, scaling and normalization with respect to the ImageNet dataset should be applied. For other modes, RGB to BGR conversion and channel-specific mean subtraction should be considered based on the data format.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = (x / 127.5) - 1.
        return x
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x = x / 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        x -= mean[None, :, None, None]
        if std is not None:
            x /= std[None, :, None, None]
    else:
        x -= mean
        if std is not None:
            x /= std
    return x
```

In the corrected function:
1. The operations for different modes are handled separately using if-elif-else statements.
2. Specific operations are performed based on the data format to ensure correct preprocessing.
3. Indexing and broadcasting are used to apply mean subtraction and normalization efficiently based on the data format.
