The bug in the provided function is related to the handling of indentation levels and newline characters within a prefix string. 

The function incorrectly processes the indentation level and waits for a newline before returning the result. This causes issues with correctly preserving the indentation of comments after a dedent.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling whitespace and newline characters, as well as how the function determines when to return the result.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == '\t':
                current_line += char
                while len(current_line.expandtabs()) < column:
                    current_line += ' '
            elif char == ' ':
                current_line += char
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                current_line += char

    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

In this corrected function, we properly handle tab characters and spaces, ensuring that the indentation level is maintained correctly. We also update the logic for determining when to return the result to align with the intended behavior of the function.
