The potential error in the buggy function is that the function is not correctly handling cases where `current_column` is less than `column`. This is causing the function to return `None` when it should return the concatenation of the lines and the remaining prefix string.

To fix this, we can modify the function to correctly handle the case where `current_column` is less than `column`. We can also simplify the logic to make it more readable.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        current_line += char
        if current_column == column:
            res = ''.join(lines)
            return res, prefix[len(res):]
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code simplifies the logic and correctly handles the case where `current_column` is equal to `column`. If `current_column` is less than `column`, it accumulates the characters in `current_line`. Once `current_column` is equal to `column`, it returns the concatenation of the lines and the remaining prefix string. If `current_column` exceeds `column`, it resets `current_line` and the accumulated lines.
