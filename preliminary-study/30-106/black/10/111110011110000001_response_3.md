The error message is indicating that the `assertFormatEqual` method is failing because the expected output does not match the actual output. The difference seems to be related to the indentation of the comment line.

Upon reviewing the `Driver` class and the `_partially_consume_prefix` method, it seems that the issue lies with how the function is handling the indentation when encountering a comment.

The buggy function is incorrectly handling the indentation and the wait for a new line after encountering a comment. The current implementation does not handle the indentation properly, leading to the incorrect result.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling comments and indentation within the `_partially_consume_prefix` method. Specifically, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation and new lines after encountering a comment.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` method:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char
            if current_column < column and char != ' ' and char != '\t':
                return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code should handle the indentation and new lines after encountering a comment correctly.
