Potential error location: The if condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column` may not be functioning as intended.

Reason behind the bug: The `if` condition is meant to check if the current line is not empty and if the current column is less than the target column. However, it is not correctly handling the case where the current line is empty but contains whitespace characters. 

Possible approach for fixing the bug: We can modify the condition to separately check for an empty line and the column count.

```python
# Corrected function
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() == '' and current_column < column:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
