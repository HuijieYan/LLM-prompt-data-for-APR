The issue with the provided function is that the indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the 'wait_for_nl' condition and the handling of '\t' characters.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the indentation level when encountering tab characters ('\t'). This results in incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to properly handle the indentation level when encountering tab characters ('\t'). This can be achieved by keeping track of the actual column position and adjusting it accordingly when encountering tab characters.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column + 4) // 4 * 4  # adjust the column position for tab characters
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code properly handles the indentation level when encountering tab characters ('\t'), which should resolve the issue of incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
