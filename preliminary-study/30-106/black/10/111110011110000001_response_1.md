The error seems to be caused by the buggy `_partially_consume_prefix` method in the `Driver` class. This method is used to consume a prefix of a string up to a certain column, and return the consumed part and the remaining part of the string.

The issue with the current implementation is that it does not properly handle the indentation and newline characters. As a result, the indentation of comments in the test function is not being handled correctly, leading to the assertion error.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_partially_consume_prefix` method to correctly handle the indentation and newline characters in the prefix string.

Here's the corrected code for the `Driver` class with the fixed `_partially_consume_prefix` method:

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class Driver(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                if char == ' ':
                    current_line += char
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_line += char
                    current_column += 4
                elif char == '\n':
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    wait_for_nl = True
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    current_line += char
                    current_column += 1
                if current_column == column:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this fixed method, the indentation and newline characters are handled correctly, and the test function should pass without any assertion errors.
