Potential error location: The if condition `if char == ' ':` and `elif char == '\t':` are incrementing `current_column` by 1 and 4 respectively, but the actual indentation may not be represented accurately due to the mix of tabs and spaces in the input. This could lead to incorrect calculation of indentation.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the function `_partially_consume_prefix` does not handle the mixed use of tabs and spaces for indentation correctly, leading to incorrect partial consumption of the prefix.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use a consistent representation of indentation (either tabs or spaces) in the input to ensure accurate calculation.
2. Handle the mixed use of tabs and spaces for indentation by detecting and processing them differently.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming 4 spaces per tab, change as needed
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
