Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the indentation handling in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function.

Reasons for the bug: The bug is likely caused by incorrect handling of the tab and space characters in the input prefix, which leads to incorrect indentation in the output.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Adjust the logic for handling tab and space characters to correctly calculate the current column position.
2. Ensure that the correct number of tab and space characters is added to the `current_column` variable when processing the input prefix.

Corrected code:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming 4 spaces for a tab character
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            lines.append(current_line)  # Add the current line to the lines list
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected code, the handling of tab characters has been updated to increment the `current_column` variable by 4 for each tab character encountered. Additionally, the logic for handling newlines has been refined to handle unexpected empty lines and reset the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables accordingly.
