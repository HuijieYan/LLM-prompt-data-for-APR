The error is likely to be in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. The function is used to consume a prefix and keep track of the current column in a code snippet.

The error message from the test shows that there is a mismatch in the expected and actual output of the `assertFormatEqual` function. This function is used to check if the formatting of the content is equal to the expected content. The error indicates that the formatting of the content is not as expected, specifically related to indentation and comments.

The issue with the function is likely related to how it handles indentation and comments in the code snippet. It seems that the function is not correctly handling the indentation and the comments, resulting in the mismatch in the test case.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the indentation and comments based on the provided prefix and column. This includes correctly tracking the current column, identifying comments, and handling indentation (including tabs and spaces).

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    in_comment = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if in_comment:
            if char == '\n':
                current_line = ""
                in_comment = False
        elif wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':
            in_comment = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
