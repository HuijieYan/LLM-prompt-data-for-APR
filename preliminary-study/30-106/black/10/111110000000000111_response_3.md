The bug in the provided function `_partially_consume_prefix` seems to be related to the handling of tab characters for indentation in the input string. 

The bug seems to be occurring when the function encounters a tab character '\t' in the input prefix. The current implementation increments the `current_column` counter by 4 for each tab character, which is incorrect. The actual tab width should be considered instead of a fixed increment.

The possible approach for fixing the bug is to replace the code that increments `current_column` for tab characters with a dynamic calculation based on the tab width. In Python, the tab width is usually considered as 8 spaces.

Here's the corrected code for the `Driver` class with the fixed `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\t':
                # calculate the effective width of the tab
                tab_width = 8 - (current_column % 8)
                current_column += tab_width
            else:
                current_line += char
                if wait_for_nl:
                    if char == '\n':
                        if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                            res = ''.join(lines)
                            return res, prefix[len(res):]
            
                        lines.append(current_line)
                        current_line = ""
                        current_column = 0
                        wait_for_nl = False
                elif char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\n':
                    # unexpected empty line
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    # indent is finished
                    wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected implementation, when a tab character is encountered, the code dynamically calculates the effective width of the tab based on the current column position. This ensures that the indentation is handled correctly, especially when dealing with comments and dedents.
