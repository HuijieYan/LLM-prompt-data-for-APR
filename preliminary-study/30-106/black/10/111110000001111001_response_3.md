The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` aims to process a prefix string and consume a subset of it based on the specified column value. However, there are several clear issues with this function:
1. The logic for checking whether the current column exceeds the specified column is incorrect. This logic should be re-evaluated and corrected.
2. The variable `wait_for_nl` is set to `True` at the beginning of the function, which may not be the desired initial state for all cases.

To fix the function, the logic for tracking the current column and identifying when to consume the prefix text needs to be revised. Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char != '\n':
            if current_column >= column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
        lines.append(current_line)

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

This implementation corrects the comparison between the `current_column` and the given `column` value and ensures that the `prefix` is consumed correctly based on the specified column.
