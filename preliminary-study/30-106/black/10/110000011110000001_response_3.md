The bug in the provided function is likely causing incorrect indentation handling, leading to the `assertFormatEqual` method failing with an AssertionError. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is meant to process a prefix, extracting lines to a certain column and returning the remaining prefix. The bug seems to be in the logic for handling whitespace characters and newlines.

The potential error location within the function is in the block that begins with `elif char == '\n'`. It resets the current column to 0, but it should check if `wait_for_nl` is True to indicate that the indent is finished before resetting the column.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function does not properly handle indentation and newline characters when processing the prefix.

To fix the bug, the function should accurately track the indentation level and handle newline characters based on whether the indent is finished or not. One approach could be to use a separate flag to track if the indent is ongoing and reset the current column at the appropriate time.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    in_indent = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            in_indent = True
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            in_indent = True
        elif char == '\n':
            if in_indent:
                in_indent = False
            else:
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            in_indent = False
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
