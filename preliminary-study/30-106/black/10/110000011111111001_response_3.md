The error message indicates that there is an issue with the formatting of the code, specifically related to comments and indentation.

Upon analysis of the buggy function, it seems that there is an issue with the logic of handling comments and indentation in the `_partially_consume_prefix` method. The logic for handling indentation and comments is not accurately determining the required indentation level for the comments.

The current logic for handling comments and indentation is failing to correctly calculate the column for the comments when there are both spaces and tabs present in the prefix.

To fix the bug, it might be necessary to rework the logic used for counting the indentation level and handling comments. This could involve a complete rewrite of the logic to accurately determine the correct column for the comments.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
            current_line += char
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            current_line += char
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_column = 0
            current_line = ""
        else:
            lines.append(current_line)
            return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
    lines.append(current_line)
    return ''.join(lines), ''
```

The modified logic accurately counts spaces and tabs for indentation and correctly appends lines and updates the current column position based on the input prefix.
