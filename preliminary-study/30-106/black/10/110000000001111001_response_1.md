The bug in the given function _partially_consume_prefix appears to be with the logic to handle indentation and checking against the given column value. The function is intended to partially consume a prefix string based on a given column value.

The bug seems to occur when the indentation of the prefix string is not a multiple of 4 spaces, causing the wait_for_nl flag to not be triggered correctly.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling the indentation and checking the column value needs to be corrected. Additionally, the current_line and lines lists are not updated correctly, leading to incorrect results.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if current_column < column and char != '\n':  # check against column value
            current_column += 1 if char == ' ' else 4 if char == '\t' else 0
        if len(current_line) >= column:  # check for exceeding column value
            return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
        if char == '\n':  # handle a new line character
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0

    return ''.join(lines), current_line  # return the consumed prefix and remaining portion
```

This corrected code ensures that the prefix string is correctly consumed based on the given column value and indentation. It also updates the current_line and lines lists correctly to provide the expected output.
