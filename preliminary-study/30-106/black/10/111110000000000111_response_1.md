Potential Error Location: The error seems to be occurring in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, specifically in the section where it checks for tabs and spaces and updates the `current_column` variable.

Reasons for the Bug: The bug seems to be related to the handling of tabs and spaces in the `prefix` string. It appears that the function does not correctly handle the indentation when encountering tabs and spaces, especially after a dedent.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: 
1. Update the logic to properly handle the indentation by accounting for tabs and spaces after a dedent.
2. Use the Python `expandtabs()` method to convert tabs to spaces and then handle the indentation uniformly.

Corrected Code:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1  # Counting spaces as 1 column
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Counting each tab as 4 columns
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0  # Reset column count for new line
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True  # Indent is finished
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected code, I have adjusted the logic for counting spaces and tabs to accurately determine the indentation level. This should address the issue with incorrect indentation especially after a dedent, and ensure that the comments are properly aligned.
