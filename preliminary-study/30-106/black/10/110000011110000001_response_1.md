The provided function _partially_consume_prefix is designed to process a given prefix character by character and stop when the given column count is reached or when a new line is encountered. However, the function has a bug that causes it to not handle new lines correctly. This is causing the test assertion to fail because the expected output is not matching the actual output.

The potential error location is within the logic that handles new line characters. The current implementation is not correctly resetting the column count and appending the lines when a new line is encountered.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling new line characters needs to be adjusted. The column count should be reset to 0, and the current line should be added to the lines list when a new line is encountered. Additionally, the code should skip adding the current line to the lines list if it's an empty line.

Below is the corrected code for the _partially_consume_prefix function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Reset column count and add the current line to the lines list
            if current_line.strip():  # Add the line if it's not empty
                lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # Check if the column count has been reached
            if current_column >= column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making these adjustments, the function should correctly handle new line characters and the column count, which should fix the bug and make the test case pass.
