The potential error in the given function is that it does not handle the case where the prefix ends without encountering a newline character. In this case, the current_line should be added to the lines list, and the function should return the result and the remaining prefix.

The bug occurs because the function does not consider the case where the prefix ends without encountering a newline character, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we can add a check at the end of the function to append the current_line to the lines list and return the result and the remaining prefix if the wait_for_nl flag is still set.

Here's the corrected code for the given function:

```python
# corrected function
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    if wait_for_nl:
        lines.append(current_line)
        return ''.join(lines), ""
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
