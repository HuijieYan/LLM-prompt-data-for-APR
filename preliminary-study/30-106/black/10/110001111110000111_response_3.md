The error message indicates that there is a problem with the indentation of comments after a dedent. The `assertFormatEqual` function is comparing two strings, and they differ in the indentation of the comment after a dedent.

The potential error lies in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, specifically in the logic related to indentation handling and waiting for a new line.

The bug occurs because the logic for handling indentation and waiting for a new line is incorrect. When encountering a new line, the function should be checking if the current column is less than the specified column before adding it to the `lines` list. This would ensure that the correct portion of the prefix is captured before the specified column.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for handling indentation and waiting for a new line in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column <= column:  # Updated condition to include equal to column
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column <= column:  # Updated condition to include equal to column
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these corrections, the function should now correctly capture the prefix up to the specified column, including handling the indentation and waiting for a new line.
