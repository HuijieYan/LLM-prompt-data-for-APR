Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, which is used to handle indentation of comments. It appears that this function is not correctly handling the indentation for comments after a dedent.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The function is not properly keeping track of the current column position and is not correctly handling the indentation for comments after a dedent.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: We need to make sure that the function properly handles the indentation for comments after a dedent and correctly keeps track of the current column position.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
