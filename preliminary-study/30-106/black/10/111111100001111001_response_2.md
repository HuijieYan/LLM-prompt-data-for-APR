The issue with the _partially_consume_prefix function is that the condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:` is not functioning as intended. This condition is supposed to check if the current line is non-empty and if the current column position is less than the provided column argument. 

In the buggy function, the condition `current_column < column` is not being checked for every character in the prefix. Instead, it is only checked when a newline character is encountered due to the placement of the condition within the `if wait_for_nl` block.

To address this issue, the condition `current_column < column` should be checked for every character in the prefix, regardless of the wait_for_nl flag. Also, the `wait_for_nl` flag should be updated to its initial value when a newline character is encountered.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            if wait_for_nl:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
