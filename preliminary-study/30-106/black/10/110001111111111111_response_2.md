The issue seems to be related to the incorrect handling of indentation for comments after dedent, especially when the code uses tabs for indentation. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is likely the cause of this issue. The function should handle the indentation and dedent logic correctly, but it seems to be failing under certain input conditions.

The bug occurs when the input has tabs for indentation, and the comments are not properly aligned after dedenting. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` fails to handle this scenario correctly.

To fix the bug, the indentation logic within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function needs to be revised to properly handle the indentation level and alignment of comments after dedenting. Additionally, the handling of tabs and spaces should be consistent to ensure correct behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if current_column < column:
            if char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_column += 1 if char == ' ' else 4 if char == '\t' else 0
            current_line += char
        else:
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = char
            current_column = 1 if char != '\n' else 0
    lines.append(current_line)
    return ''.join(lines), ''
```

This revised code should handle the indentation and dedent logic correctly, addressing the issue related to the incorrect handling of tabulated comments after a dedent.
