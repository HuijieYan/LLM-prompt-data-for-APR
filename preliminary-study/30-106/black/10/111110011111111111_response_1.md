The bug seems to be in the `_partially_consume_prefix` method of the `Driver` class. The method is supposed to partially consume the input prefix based on the specified column and return the consumed part and the remaining part of the prefix. However, the current implementation is not handling the indentation for comments correctly, leading to incorrect behavior.

The test case `test_comment_indentation` is failing due to incorrect handling of comments. The indentation for comments after a dedent is being changed incorrectly.

The bug seems to be occurring due to the logic not correctly identifying and handling the indentation for comments after dedent operations. This is causing the incorrect behavior seen in the test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` method to correctly handle the indentation for comments after dedent operations.

The corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` method is as follows:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char in [' ', '\t']:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            else:  # char is '\t'
                current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            if current_line.strip().startswith('#'):
                wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code adds additional logic to correctly handle the indentation for comments after dedent operations. The `wait_for_nl` flag is used to identify when the code is expected to wait for a new line after an indent, and the logic for updating `current_column` is also updated to handle spaces and tabs.

This should resolve the issue with the incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent operation.
