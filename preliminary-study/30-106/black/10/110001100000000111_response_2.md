The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statement `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column`. This logic is incorrect because it only checks if the current column is less than the desired column for the current line, but it does not take into account the leading spaces or tabs that contribute to the indentation level.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the indentation level when consuming the prefix. As a result, it fails to preserve the correct indentation for comments after a dedent.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to accurately track the actual indentation level in the given prefix and adjust it accordingly when consuming the prefix. This involves taking into account the spaces, tabs, and new lines in the prefix to determine the correct indentation level for each line of the prefix.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_indent = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_indent < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_indent = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_indent += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_indent += 4
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_indent = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected code, we maintain a `current_indent` variable to accurately track the indentation level for each line in the prefix. This ensures that the correct indentation level is preserved when consuming the prefix, thereby fixing the bug related to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
