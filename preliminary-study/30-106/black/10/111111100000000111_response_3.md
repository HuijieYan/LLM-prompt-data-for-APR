Potential Error Location: The issue seems to be related to how the function `_partially_consume_prefix` handles indentation when processing lines with tabs.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The function does not correctly handle tabs when calculating the indentation level, which leads to incorrect handling of the comments after a dedent.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: We can fix the bug by properly handling tab characters when calculating the indentation level. This may involve converting tabs to spaces and then calculating the indentation level based on spaces.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':  # Convert tab to 4 spaces
            tab_width = 4
            spaces_to_add = tab_width - (current_column % tab_width)
            current_line += " " * spaces_to_add
            current_column += spaces_to_add
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
