Potential error location: The bug seems to be in the logic for checking the current column and waiting for a new line. It appears that the logic for handling the current column and waiting for a new line is not properly synchronized.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
- The logic for tracking the current column and waiting for a new line is not correctly handling the cases where a new line should be waited for and where the current column count should be updated.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Update the logic for checking the current column and waiting for a new line to ensure that it accurately tracks the current position and handles the new line character properly.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
