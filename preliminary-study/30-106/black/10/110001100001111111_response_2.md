The issue seems to be related to the function incorrectly handling the indentation of comments after a dedent. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming the prefix based on a given column value. The issue is likely occurring in the logic that handles the indentation and newline characters.

The bug is occurring because the function is not properly handling the indentation logic for tabulated comments after a dedent. When encountering a tab character, the function incorrectly increments the `current_column` by 4, which is causing the incorrect handling of the comment indentation.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling tab characters and their impact on the `current_column`.
Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            next_tab_stop = current_column + (4 - (current_column % 4))
            current_column = next_tab_stop
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected code, when the function encounters a tab character, it calculates the next tab stop based on the current column value and adjusts the `current_column` accordingly. This should fix the incorrect handling of tabulated comments after a dedent.
