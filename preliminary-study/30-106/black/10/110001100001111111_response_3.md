The issue seems to be related to incorrect handling of indentation for comments after a dedent, especially when tabs are used for indentation. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming the prefix based on the given column value. It seems that the function is not correctly handling the indentation for comments after a dedent.

The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle the indentation level when tabs are used. This leads to incorrect column calculations and ultimately results in incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation level, especially when tabs are used. Instead of directly counting spaces and tabs, we should calculate the actual indentation level based on the input string.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                space_count = len(current_line) - len(current_line.lstrip())
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = space_count
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming 4 spaces for each tab character
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected code, we calculate the actual indentation level using the `len(current_line) - len(current_line.lstrip())` to count the number of spaces or tabs. We also assume 4 spaces for each tab character when calculating the column position.

This should fix the bug and ensure correct handling of indentation, especially when tabs are used.
