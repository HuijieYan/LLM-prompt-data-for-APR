Potential error location:
The issue seems to be with the handling of tab characters in the _partially_consume_prefix function, which is causing incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent.

Reasons for the bug:
The function is not handling tab characters properly, which results in incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Properly count the number of spaces represented by tab characters and adjust the current_column accordingly.
2. Add a condition to handle tab characters and adjust the current_column based on the number of spaces equivalent to a tab.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Adjust the current_column based on the number of spaces equivalent to a tab
            tab_spaces = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_column += tab_spaces
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
