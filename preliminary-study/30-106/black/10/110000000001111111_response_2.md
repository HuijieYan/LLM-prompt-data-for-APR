The bug in the provided function is that the indentation level is not appropriately handled for comments after a dedent. This results in incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.

The potential error location within the function is the handling of indentation levels and tab characters.

The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle tab characters when calculating the current column indentation level. This causes the function to incorrectly calculate the column for tabulated comments after a dedent.

To fix the bug, the function should accurately handle tab characters and adjust the column indentation level accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)  # adjust column for tab character
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected code now properly handles tab characters and adjusts the column indentation level accordingly, ensuring that tabulated comments after a dedent have the correct indentation.
