Potential error location: The portion of the code where the function checks for the end of the indent (wait_for_nl is True) seems to be problematic. The function should return the result and the remaining prefix when the current column is less than the specified column, but the conditions for checking this are not correctly placed.

Reason for the bug: The bug occurs because the logic for checking the end of an indent and the current column being less than the specified column is not correctly implemented. This causes the function to not return the expected result.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
We can modify the logic to properly check for the end of an indent and the current column being less than the specified column. This can be achieved by reorganizing the conditional statements to correctly handle these conditions.

Corrected code:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
