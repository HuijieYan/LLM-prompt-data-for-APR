The error occurs due to incorrect indentation of comments after the dedent. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for this behavior.

The bug occurs when the function encounters a comment after a dedent. The function is not handling this case correctly, which results in incorrect indentation of the comment.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the case where a comment appears after a dedent. It should ensure that the comment retains the same level of indentation as the following code.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected function properly handles the indentation of comments after a dedent and should resolve the bug.
