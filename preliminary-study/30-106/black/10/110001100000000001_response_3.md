Potential error location: The bug seems to be in the logic for handling indentation and newlines within the prefix string.

Reasons behind the bug: The code does not correctly handle the indentation level and newlines in the prefix string. It fails to properly track the current_column and does not handle newlines in a way that aligns with the intended logic.

Approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. We need to correctly update the current_column based on the characters encountered.
2. Properly handle the case when a newline is encountered after indentation.
3. Ensure that the lines list is updated appropriately to capture the lines consumed.

Corrected code:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    i = 0  # index to track position in prefix
    while i < len(prefix):
        char = prefix[i]
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
        i += 1
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
