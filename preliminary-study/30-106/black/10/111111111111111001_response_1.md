The issue in the buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is that it does not properly handle the indentation of the comments when converting from tabs to spaces. This leads to incorrect output which causes the test case `test_comment_indentation` to fail.

The buggy function does not correctly handle the different indentation levels when converting tabs to spaces. This causes the incorrect output when comparing the converted string with the expected string in the test case.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the indentation when converting tabs to spaces and ensure that the comments are correctly placed at the same indentation level.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)  # Adjust indent
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected code, the function will handle the indentation correctly when converting tabs to spaces, ensuring that the comments are placed at the correct indentation level. This should resolve the issue and make the test case pass.
