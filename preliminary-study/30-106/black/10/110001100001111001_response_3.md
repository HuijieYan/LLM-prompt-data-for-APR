The issue with the function is that the condition for checking the column value is incorrect. The code is returning the result and the remaining prefix based on the length of the `res` variable. However, the `res` variable is not being updated after the first line is processed, causing unexpected behavior in returning the remaining prefix.

To fix the bug, the condition for checking the column value should be updated to track the column count correctly and update the `res` value accordingly.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and len(current_line.expandtabs()) <= column:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
