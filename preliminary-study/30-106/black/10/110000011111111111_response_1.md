The error message from the test function indicates that the function `fs` is not formatting the input `contents_tab` correctly. The issue seems to be related to the handling of comments and their indentation after a dedent.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic to handle the indentation and line breaks in the function `_partially_consume_prefix`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the logic to handle indentation and line breaks does not consider the correct behavior for comments after a dedent, leading to incorrect indentation of comments.

To fix the bug, the function `_partially_consume_prefix` needs to be updated to correctly handle comments after a dedent by preserving their original indentation.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            lines.append(current_line)  # preserve original indentation
            current_line = ""
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the indentation and line breaks, preserving the original indentation of comments after a dedent. This should resolve the issue reported in the error message.
