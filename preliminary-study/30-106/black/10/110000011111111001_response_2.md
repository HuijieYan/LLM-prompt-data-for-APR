Potential Error Location:
The issue seems to be with the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, where the indentation is not being handled correctly. This is causing the test to fail, specifically on lines with comments.

Reasons for the Occurrence of the Bug:
The function is not handling the indentation and comments properly, resulting in incorrect output and failing the test cases.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. We need to properly handle the indentation and comments within the prefix string.
2. It seems that the logic for handling tabs and spaces is incorrect.
3. We need to ensure that the function correctly identifies the position of the comment within the indentation.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1  # Fixed logic to handle a single space
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Adjusted logic to reflect 4 spaces for a tab
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0  # Reset column count for new line
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True  # The position attributed to the first non-indent character
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
