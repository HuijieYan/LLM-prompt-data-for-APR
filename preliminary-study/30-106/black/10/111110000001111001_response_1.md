The buggy function "_partially_consume_prefix" is designed to consume a prefix string one character at a time until a certain column is reached. However, in some cases, it fails to correctly handle tab characters and new lines.

In the given code, for the 'char' types '\t' and '\n', the 'current_column' is not being updated, causing incorrect behavior and output.

To fix the bug, the 'current_column' should be updated based on the encountered character type.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the fixed function
class Driver(object):
    # ... omitted code ...


    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)  # adjust for tabs
            else:
                current_column += 1  # count other characters as 1 column
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The changes made to the original code include:
- Updating the 'current_column' with 4 minus the modulus of its value to achieve equivalent behavior for both ' ' and '\t'.
- For other characters, the 'current_column' is simply incremented by 1 to represent the width of a single character.
