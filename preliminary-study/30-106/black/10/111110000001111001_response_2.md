The bug in the function _partially_consume_prefix is likely caused by the logic error in the conditional statements. 

The usage of wait_for_nl is causing unexpected behavior. It is used to determine whether the function has encountered a newline character and is now waiting to confirm that the indentation of the next line is less than the specified column.

The bug seems to be in the way the loop iterates and handles the "wait_for_nl" flag. The "wait_for_nl" flag should be reset to False every time a newline character is encountered, not when a condition is met following the newline character.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif wait_for_nl:
            continue
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this code, the "wait_for_nl" flag is reset to False every time a newline is encountered, ensuring that the function behaves as expected.
