Potential error location:
The issue likely occurs when checking for lines that are indented to a certain column. The code may be incorrectly removing the indentation before the specified column.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs due to incorrectly handling the indentation count and not properly checking for lines that are indented to a certain column.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Reset the current column count when a newline character is encountered.
2. Adjust the logic for keeping track of tab and space characters when calculating the current column count.
3. Update the code to properly handle cases where the current line exceeds the specified column limit.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
