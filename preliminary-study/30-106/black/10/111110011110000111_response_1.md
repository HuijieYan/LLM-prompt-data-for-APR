Potential error location: The issue seems to be related to the handling of indentation of comments within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. 

Reason for the occurrence of the bug: The function is not correctly handling the indentation of comments after a dedent. This results in incorrect indentation for comments that should be on the same level as the next line.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Adjust the logic for handling the indentation of comments, especially after dedents.
2. Ensure that the function correctly identifies and preserves the indentation of comments.

Corrected code:

```python
class Driver(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                wait_for_nl = char != '#'
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
