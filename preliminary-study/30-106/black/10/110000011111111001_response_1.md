The error occurs when comparing the expected output with the actual output in the test function `test_comment_indentation`. The error message indicates that the actual output is not matching the expected output, specifically for the `contents_tab` variable.

Upon analyzing the provided buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix`, it seems that there is an issue with the logic when checking for the indentation level. The current implementation does not accurately handle the indentation levels and fails to correctly consume the prefix.

The root cause of the bug is that the logic for tracking the current column and waiting for a new line is not correctly implemented. This causes the function to incorrectly return the consumed characters and fail to handle certain cases, resulting in the mismatched outputs.

To fix this bug, we need to revise the logic for tracking the indentation level and waiting for a new line. We should ensure that the indentation level is accurately calculated, and the prefix is correctly consumed based on the specified column.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        if current_column >= column:
            return ''.join(lines), current_line

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the above changes, the function should now correctly handle the indentation level and consume the prefix based on the specified column, resolving the bug.

After making these changes, the `test_comment_indentation` function should no longer encounter the previous assertion error, as the function will correctly consume the prefix to match the expected output.
