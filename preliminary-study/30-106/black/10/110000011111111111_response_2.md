The error message from the test function indicates that there is an issue with the indentation of comments after a dedent. This suggests that the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not correctly handling the indentation of comments.

The potential error location within the function could be the logic that handles the indentation of comments and waits for a new line.

The bug occurs because the function is not correctly identifying the end of the comment and adjusting the indentation accordingly. This results in incorrect indentation of comments after a dedent.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies the end of the comment and adjusts the indentation based on the current column and the presence of a new line.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        if char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected code, the logic for handling the end of the comment and adjusting the indentation has been modified to ensure correct behavior. This should fix the bug related to incorrect comment indentation after a dedent.
