Potential error location: The `wait_for_nl` condition is not being reset to `False` after a new line character is encountered, causing it to skip subsequent characters.

Reason behind the bug: The `wait_for_nl` condition is not being reset after encountering a new line character, which causes the function to skip over characters that should be counted towards the current column.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Reset the `wait_for_nl` condition to `False` after encountering a new line character.
2. Move the `wait_for_nl` assignment to the beginning of the for loop, so it gets reset for every character in the `prefix` string.

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
