Based on the values and types of the variables and input parameters for the buggy function, it appears that the issue is related to the handling of tab characters and their impact on the indentation level.

In the buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix`, the issue stems from the incorrect calculation of the current_column when encountering tab characters. As tab characters should contribute 4 spaces to the current column, the current_column calculation needs to be adjusted to account for this.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic for handling tab characters and their impact on the current_column calculation.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            # Calculate the number of spaces the tab character contributes
            spaces_to_add = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_line += " " * spaces_to_add
            current_column += spaces_to_add
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected code, the function should now correctly handle the indentation when encountering tab characters within the prefix.
