Error location:
The issue is likely to be in the section where the `newlines` value is calculated.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The `newlines` variable is being calculated based on certain conditions related to the control flow, imports, and yields, but in some cases, there is incorrect adjustment of the `newlines` value.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Review and update the conditions where the `newlines` variable is being calculated, ensuring that it follows the correct logic for each case.
2. Consider simplifying the logic for `newlines` calculation by breaking it down into smaller parts to simplify the debugging process.

Corrected code:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return 0, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return 0, 0

    return 0, 0
