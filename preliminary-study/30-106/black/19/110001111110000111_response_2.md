The error occurred when the `assertFormatEqual` method was called in the test function. This error occurred because the actual and expected outputs were not equal; there were discrepancies in the whitespace and new line characters.

Upon analyzing the code, it seems that the `_maybe_empty_lines` method is causing the issue. It appears that this method is responsible for adding or removing empty lines based on certain conditions. 

The bug seems to be related to the calculation of newlines and spacing. It's likely that the logic for determining when to add or remove newlines is incorrect in the `_maybe_empty_lines` method. This is leading to unexpected output, causing the test to fail.

To fix this bug, the logic for determining when to add or remove newlines needs to be carefully reviewed and possibly revised. 

Here's the corrected `_maybe_empty_lines` method:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import()
        and not current_line.is_import()
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield()
        and (not current_line.is_yield() or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

Changes made:
- Added parentheses to the `is_import` and `is_yield` calls to make them method calls.
- Corrected the logic for adding or removing newlines based on various conditions.
