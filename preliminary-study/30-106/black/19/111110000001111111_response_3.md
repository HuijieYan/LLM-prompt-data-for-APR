The bug here is that the function `_maybe_empty_lines` is not returning the expected tuples as indicated in the test cases. The issue seems to be related to how the `if` conditions within the function are structured. 

The bug occurs because the previous line is not being handled properly in all code paths. Additionally, there are certain conditions where a tuple should be returned, but the function returns individual integer values.

To fix this issue, we need to restructure the `if` conditions to handle the cases outlined in the test inputs and expected outputs. We also need to ensure that the function consistently returns tuples of integers.

Below is the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function with an explanation of the changes:

```python
# Corrected and modified function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if self.previous_line is None:
        return 0, 0
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if (
            self.previous_line.is_decorator
            or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator)
        ):
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (1, 0)
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (1, 0)
    
    return 0, 0
```

In the corrected function, the `if` conditions are restructured to handle different cases. The function consistently returns tuples of integers as expected in the test cases. This should resolve the bug and make the function return the correct values for the given inputs.
