Potential error location: 
The bug may occur in the logic for determining the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line, as the current implementation is not considering all the necessary conditions.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. The code does not handle all the conditions for determining the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
2. The logic for handling decorators, flow control, imports, and yields is not accurately implemented.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Revise the logic for determining the number of empty lines based on different scenarios such as decorators, flow control, imports, and yields.
2. Consider all possible edge cases and conditions for calculating the number of empty lines.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        if current_line.depth:
            return 1, 0
        return 2, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return 1, 0

    return before, 0
