The error message indicates that the actual output does not match the expected output in terms of empty lines within the function. This suggests that the function `_maybe_empty_lines` is not correctly handling the insertion of empty lines in specific cases.

The potential error location within the function is likely the portion of the code where the insertion of empty lines is handled based on different conditions.

The bug occurs because the function is not accurately handling the insertion of empty lines under different scenarios such as decorators, flow control, imports, and yield statements. This leads to discrepancies in the expected and actual output.

To fix the bug, you could revise the logic for handling different scenarios involving decorators, flow control, imports, and yield statements. Additionally, checking the depth of the line and adapting the handling of empty lines based on the previous line's characteristics could help achieve the expected output.

Below is the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
# corrected _maybe_empty_lines function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if current_line.is_decorator and (self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line and (
            self.previous_line.is_import
            or (self.previous_line.is_yield and current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return max(1, current_line.leaves[0].prefix.count("\n")), 0
        newlines = 2 - current_line.depth
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return int(bool(current_line.leaves)), 1
    if current_line.is_import and (
        not self.previous_line
        or (
            not self.previous_line.is_import
            and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
        )
    ):
        return max(1, current_line.leaves[0].prefix.count("\n")), 0
    if current_line.is_yield and (
        not self.previous_line
        or (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(1, current_line.leaves[0].prefix.count("\n")), 0
    return (
        max(1, current_line.leaves[0].prefix.count("\n"))
        if current_line.leaves
        else 0,
        0,
    )
```

This corrected code accounts for the different scenarios and factors that determine the correct handling of empty lines based on the conditions provided in the test cases.
