Potential Error Location:
The potential error location in the code is the handling of the before variable within the while loop.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the before variable is being overwritten within the while loop, which may not be the intended behavior.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we can store the initial value of the before variable before entering the while loop, and then update it only if the while loop condition is met. Additionally, it may be necessary to handle the case when the depth is 0 separately.

Corrected Code:
```python
from typing import Tuple

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    initial_before = before  # Store the initial value of before
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        if depth == 0:
            before = 2  # Update before if depth is 0
        else:
            before = initial_before  # Restore the initial value of before
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
