The potential error in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is that the logic to calculate the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line is not implemented correctly. There are multiple conditions and checks that need to be handled properly to determine the appropriate number of empty lines.

The bug occurs because the logic to calculate the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line is not correctly implemented. This leads to incorrect results and potentially inconsistent behavior in the code.

To fix this bug, the function needs to be refactored to properly handle each condition and calculate the correct number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line.

Here's the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

# this is the corrected function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    after = 0
    
    # logic to calculate the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        before = 2
    elif current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    if self.previous_line:
        if (
            (current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class)
            and not self.previous_line.is_decorator
        ):
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            after = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        elif current_line.is_flow_control:
            after = 1
        elif (
            self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            after = before or 1
        elif (
            self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            after = before or 1
    
    return before, after
```

In the corrected code, the logic to calculate the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line is properly handled for each condition, and the correct values are returned as a tuple.
