The `maybe_empty_lines` function seems to have several conditional statements and logical checks based on the properties of the `current_line` and the instance attributes of the class `EmptyLineTracker`. 

The function relies on the correct detection of attributes such as `depth`, `leaves`, `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield` of the `current_line`. It also uses instance attributes like `previous_defs` and `previous_line` of `EmptyLineTracker`.

The potential bug in the function could be related to the complex conditional statements that might not be handling all possible combinations of these attributes correctly.

For the fix, the function may need more comprehensive conditional handling based on the combinations of these attributes and the instances of the class.

Corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
from typing import Tuple
...

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
    if (self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0
```
