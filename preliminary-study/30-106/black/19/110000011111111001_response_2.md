The error appears to be caused by the incorrect handling of empty lines within the function `_maybe_empty_lines`. The function is supposed to determine the number of empty lines to be added before the current line based on certain conditions.

Upon analyzing the test case and error message, it seems that the produced `actual` output does not match the expected output in terms of the placement of empty lines. This indicates that the logic for adding empty lines in the `current_line` might be incorrect or not properly implemented.

The bug could be occurring due to the inconsistent handling of adding empty lines before and after certain elements such as decorators, flow control statements, imports, and yield statements. The logic to compute the number of empty lines before the current line seems to be implemented incorrectly, leading to mismatched outputs.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to review and revise the conditions for adding empty lines before the current line within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. The logic should be thoroughly checked to ensure that it correctly handles various scenarios and follows the expected formatting rules for adding empty lines.

The corrected function `_maybe_empty_lines` is provided below:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        return 1, 0  # Add 1 empty line before the current line

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1  # Add 1 empty line after the current line

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return 1, 0  # Add 1 empty line before the current line

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return 1, 0  # Add 1 empty line before the current line

    return 0, 0  # No empty lines needed before or after the current line
```

In the corrected function, the logic for adding empty lines before or after the current line is adjusted based on the specific conditions. The handling of decorators, flow control, imports, and yield statements is reviewed to ensure the appropriate number of empty lines are added according to the expected formatting rules.
