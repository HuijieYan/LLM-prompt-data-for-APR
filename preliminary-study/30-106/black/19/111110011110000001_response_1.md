The error message is showing a comparison between the expected and actual values, and the discrepancy seems to be related to the number of empty lines. This suggests that the `_maybe_empty_lines` function in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is not correctly handling the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line.

The potential error location within the problematic function could be the logic for computing the number of empty lines before and after the current line, specifically the handling of `before` and `newlines` variables.

The bug seems to be occurring because the logic for computing the number of empty lines before and after the current line is not correctly accounting for all the conditions and cases mentioned in the comments.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to carefully review the logic and conditions, and ensure that each condition is correctly handled to compute the correct number of empty lines before and after the current line.

Here's the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    before = 0
    newlines = 0

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and
            not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and
            (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

In the corrected code, the `before` and `newlines` variables are initialized before the various condition checks, and their values are updated according to the specific conditions. This ensures that the number of empty lines before and after the current line is correctly computed based on the outlined rules.
