The issue with the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is that it has complex logic and unclear data dependencies. It's difficult to understand the purpose of the function without deeper knowledge of the surrounding code. 

However, based on the input and expected output, I suggest the following refactored function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

class Line:
    def __init__(self, depth: int, leaves: list, comments: list, bracket_tracker: any, inside_brackets: bool) -> None:
        self.depth = depth
        self.leaves = leaves
        self.comments = comments
        self.bracket_tracker = bracket_tracker
        self.inside_brackets = inside_brackets
        self.is_import = False
        self.is_class = False
        self.is_def = False
        self.is_yield = False
        self.is_decorator = False
        self.is_flow_control = False

class EmptyLineTracker:
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        newlines = 0
        if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not current_line.is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line and not self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                newlines = 2
                if current_line.depth:
                    newlines -= 1
            return newlines, before
        elif current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return (before or 1), 0
        elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return (before or 1), 0
        else:
            return before, 0
```

This refactored implementation uses a simpler and clearer logic to determine the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.

Please note that this refactoring does not perfectly replicate the behavior of the original function due to the limited context provided. However, it improves readability and addresses some common sources of bugs in the original function.
