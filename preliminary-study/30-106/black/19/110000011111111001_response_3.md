The error message indicates that the function `assertFormatEqual` in the `test_comment_in_decorator` test is failing. The error message asserts that the expected output and the actual output are not matching.

The bug in the function `_maybe_empty_lines` is likely due to incorrect handling of the logic for determining the number of newlines to be added. The function seems to be returning incorrect newlines when the `is_decorator` flag is set to `True` for the `current_line`.

The `if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class` condition seems to be causing the issue. The newlines logic within this block is likely incorrect, leading to the failure in the test.

To fix the bug, the logic for determining the number of newlines to be added when `is_decorator` is `True` needs to be reviewed and corrected.

Below is the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        self.previous_defs.append(depth)

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected code, the logic for handling `is_decorator` has been revised to correctly handle the insertion of empty lines. Additionally, the conditions for `is_def` and `is_class` have been updated to append to `previous_defs`. This should address the issue and correct the behavior of the function.
