Potential error location:
The error is likely occurring in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. Since the error message mentions a format mismatch between the expected and actual output of the test, the issue is likely related to the formatting of the input source within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The `_maybe_empty_lines` function handles the insertion of empty lines based on specific conditions. It seems that the function is not handling the insertion of empty lines correctly, leading to a formatting mismatch in the test results.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check and adjust the logic for inserting empty lines based on different line types and depth levels to ensure correct formatting.
2. Verify the handling of comments and decorators within the function to address any specific handling requirements for these cases.
3. Debug the `_maybe_empty_lines` function with sample inputs that result in the formatting mismatch to identify specific areas that need correction.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
from typing import Tuple

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
