The potential error location within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is in the conditionals where it checks for `current_line.is_decorator`, `current_line.is_def`, and `current_line.is_class`. These attributes are not defined for the Line class, and therefore the code will raise an AttributeError when trying to access these nonexistent attributes.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code is trying to access attributes `is_decorator`, `is_def`, and `is_class` on the `current_line` object, which are not part of the Line class definition.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to remove the references to `current_line.is_decorator`, `current_line.is_def`, and `current_line.is_class` and replace them with appropriate logic based on the defined attributes of the Line class.

Here's the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
       
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected code, the references to `current_line.is_decorator`, `current_line.is_def`, and `current_line.is_class` have been removed. The code has been simplified to handle the relevant conditions without accessing undefined attributes.
