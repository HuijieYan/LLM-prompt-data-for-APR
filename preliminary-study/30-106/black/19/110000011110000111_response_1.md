The error message indicates that the `assertFormatEqual` method is failing because the expected and actual values do not match. The mismatch is likely due to extra empty lines being added in the actual value returned by the `fs` function.

Upon analyzing the `maybe_empty_lines` function, it seems that the issue may be related to the logic for adding empty lines before certain types of lines. The function checks various conditions and returns the number of empty lines to insert before the current line.

One possible reason for the bug is that the logic for calculating the number of empty lines to insert is incorrect or incomplete. This could result in extra empty lines being added, causing the mismatch in the test case.

To fix the bug, the logic for determining the number of empty lines to insert before different types of lines needs to be carefully reviewed and corrected. Additionally, the conditions for special cases such as decorators, flow control, imports, and yields should be thoroughly checked to ensure the correct number of empty lines are returned.

Here's the corrected `maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
from typing import Tuple
class Line:
    def __init__(self, depth, leaves, is_decorator, is_def, is_class, is_flow_control, is_import, is_yield):
        self.depth = depth
        self.leaves = leaves
        self.is_decorator = is_decorator
        self.is_def = is_def
        self.is_class = is_class
        self.is_flow_control = is_flow_control
        self.is_import = is_import
        self.is_yield = is_yield

class Example:
    def __init__(self):
        self.previous_defs = []
        self.previous_line = None

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return before, 0
```
