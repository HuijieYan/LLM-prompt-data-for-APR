Potential error location: The section where `before` is being updated within the while loop.

Reasons for the occurrence of the bug: The `before` variable is being updated within the while loop, which can lead to unexpected results. Additionally, the conditions within the if statements might not cover all cases.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
1. Update the while loop to only update `before` if the condition is met.
2. Add additional conditions to cover all cases based on the requirements of the function.

Corrected code:

```python
from typing import Tuple

# Corrected function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    index = 0
    while index < len(self.previous_defs) and self.previous_defs[index] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        index += 1
        before = 1 if depth else 2

            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (

        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
