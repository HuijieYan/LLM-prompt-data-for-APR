The error message indicates that the actual output does not match the expected output, specifically related to the presence of empty lines. This is likely caused by the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, as it is responsible for determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. 

Upon analyzing the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, the bug seems to stem from the logic used to calculate the number of empty lines. The conditionals and their corresponding return statements may not cover all possible cases, leading to discrepancies between the expected and actual output.

To fix this bug, a more comprehensive approach to handling different scenarios for the number of empty lines is needed. This might involve revising the conditional statements, refining the logic to consider all relevant factors, and adjusting the return values as necessary to ensure the correct number of empty lines is calculated.

Here's the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    after = 0
    
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        before = 2
    else:
        before = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_def and not current_line.is_def:
            before = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
            return before, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (
            not current_line.is_yield
            or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth
        )
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, after
```

The revised function includes a more structured approach to handling different cases, ensuring that the correct number of empty lines is returned based on the conditions specified in the function.
