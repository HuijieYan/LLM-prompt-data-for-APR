The potential error in the provided function is that it is not properly checking the conditions and returning the correct values for the number of newlines and indentation.

The bug occurs because the function is not properly handling the conditions for different types of lines (decorator, def, class, import, flow control, yield) and their depth.

To fix the bug, we can implement the following changes:
1. Properly check the conditions for different types of lines and their depth.
2. Ensure that the correct number of newlines and indentation is returned based on the type of line and its relationship with the previous line.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

class Line:
    # Define the Line class if it's not already provided
    pass

class Leaf:
    # Define the Leaf class if it's not already provided
    pass

class MyClass:
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return (before or 1), 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return before, 0
```

In the corrected code, the conditions are properly checked for different line types and their depth, and the correct number of newlines and indentation is returned based on the type of line and its relationship with the previous line.
