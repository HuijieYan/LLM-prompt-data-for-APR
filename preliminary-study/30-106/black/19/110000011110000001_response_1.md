The error occurs when the `assertFormatEqual` method is called in the `test_comment_in_decorator` test function. It seems that the actual value returned by the function under test (`fs`) does not match the expected value, which leads to the assertion failure.

Based on the error message, it appears that the issue might be related to the handling of empty lines and comments within decorators. The bug could be located in the `_maybe_empty_lines` method, specifically in the section that deals with decorators. The incorrect handling of empty lines before and after decorators might be causing the formatting mismatch.

The potential error in the `_maybe_empty_lines` method could be due to incorrect logic for calculating the number of empty lines before and after decorators. This might be leading to an incorrect output that fails the comparison with the expected value.

To fix the bug, you should review the logic that calculates the number of empty lines before and after decorators in the `_maybe_empty_lines` method. Ensure that the logic accurately captures the rules for inserting empty lines before and after decorators according to the desired formatting style.

The corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` method is as follows:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        if current_line.depth:
            return 1, 1

        return 1, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

The changes in the corrected code focus on ensuring that the correct number of empty lines is inserted before and after decorators, as well as addressing potential edge cases related to line depth and types of lines.
