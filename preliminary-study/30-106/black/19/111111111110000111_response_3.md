The error message indicates that there is a mismatch between the expected format and the actual format of the source code. The code fails at the assertion of these two formats.

The potential error location within the problematic function is where the function tries to adjust newlines and indentation based on certain conditions. The behavior related to decorators, imports, yields, and flow control seems to be causing the issue.

The bug is likely occurring because the logic for handling newlines and indentation based on different conditions (decorators, imports, yields, etc.) is not correctly implemented, leading to incorrect formatting of the source code.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to carefully analyze the requirements for newlines and indentation in different scenarios and update the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function accordingly.

Below is the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function based on the provided information:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator()
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def() or current_line.is_class():
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0  # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator():
            return 0, 0  # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control():
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import()
        and not current_line.is_import()
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield()
        and (not current_line.is_yield() or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected code, the conditions for checking decorators, imports, yields, and flow control are updated, and appropriate methods are called to check these conditions. Additionally, the return statements are updated with correct formatting conditions based on the given logic.
