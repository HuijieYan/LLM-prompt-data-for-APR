The buggy function is designed to calculate the number of empty lines to be inserted before the current line. It takes into consideration various conditions such as the depth of the current line, whether it is a decorator, a flow control statement, or a def/class statement, and whether the previous line was an import or yield statement. 

However, there are some issues in the implementation, particularly with the handling of certain cases such as decorators, class/def statements, and flow control statements. 

In the first case, for input parameters current_line.is_decorator, and current_line.depth, the condition `if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class` is evaluated to True, but then further conditions are checked for the previous line, which makes this condition redundant. 

In the second case, for the same input parameters, the condition `if current_line.is_flow_control` is not handled properly and should take into account the max_allowed value.

To fix this function, we should handle all conditions for the current line and return the respective number of empty lines to be inserted before the current line. It's also important to ensure that the handling of previous line conditions is consistent throughout the function.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        return 2, 0

    if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not self.previous_line:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return max_allowed, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return 1, 0

    return max_allowed, 0
```
