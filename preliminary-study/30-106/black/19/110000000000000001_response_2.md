Potential error location: 

The potential error in this function lies in the if-else conditions and the logic for calculating the number of newlines to be returned.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:

1. The if-else conditions are not properly handling the scenarios for different types of lines, such as decorators, flow control, import lines, yield lines, etc.
2. The logic for calculating the number of newlines seems to be incorrect and may not be returning the expected results.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

1. Refactor the if-else conditions to properly handle different types of lines and their respective requirements for newlines.
2. Revisit the logic for calculating the number of newlines based on the line type and its relationship with the previous line.

Corrected code:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
        
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        else:
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
