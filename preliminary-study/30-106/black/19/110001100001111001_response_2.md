The issue with the `maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the incorrect handling of the condition for determining new lines. It looks like the code is trying to determine the number of new lines to be inserted based on various conditions related to the code structure.

The bug appears to be happening due to incorrect logic to identify the number of new lines to be inserted under certain conditions, such as decorators, imports, yields, etc. Additionally, the update of `self.previous_defs` is also not consistent.

To fix the bug, we need to carefully revise the logic for handling different code structure scenarios and update the `self.previous_defs` list correctly based on these conditions.

Here's the corrected code for the `maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    newlines = 0

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    else:
        max_allowed = 1

    # Check for decorators, imports, yields, etc. and the previous line structure to determine new lines
    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            newlines = 0
        else:
            newlines = max(0, max_allowed - before)
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)

    elif current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not self.previous_line:
            newlines = 0
        else:
            newlines = 2 if current_line.depth > 0 else 1
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)

    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        newlines = before
        before = 1

    elif current_line.is_import:
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            before = max(1, before)
        newlines = 0

    elif current_line.is_yield:
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth:
            before = max(1, before)
        newlines = 0

    return before, newlines
```

In the corrected code, the logic for each scenario has been updated to correctly determine the number of new lines and to update the `self.previous_defs` list based on the conditions.

This correction should address the issues with the `maybe_empty_lines` function and ensure that it behaves as intended under different code structure scenarios.
