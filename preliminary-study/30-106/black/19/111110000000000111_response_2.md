The potential error location within the `_maybe_empty_lines` method is at the end where it returns the number of newlines. The logic for determining the number of newlines before and after the current line seems to be incorrect. In some cases, the code returns `0, 0` even though there might need to be newlines before or after the line.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to re-evaluate the logic for determining the number of newlines before and after the current line. The conditions for inserting newlines should be carefully reviewed to ensure that the appropriate number of newlines is returned based on the context of the current line and the previous line.

Here's the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` method:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines_before = 2 if current_line.depth > 0 else 1
        newlines_after = 0
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        newlines_before = before
        newlines_after = 1
    elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        newlines_before = before if before > 0 else 1
        newlines_after = 0
    elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        newlines_before = before if before > 0 else 1
        newlines_after = 0
    else:
        newlines_before = before
        newlines_after = 0

    return newlines_before, newlines_after
```
