The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has multiple issues:

1. The `if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class` block contains the condition `if not is_decorator`. But this condition is redundant since it already checks for `is_decorator` in the outer `if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class` condition.

2. The logic within the `if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class` block is misleading and overly complex, making it hard to understand its purpose.

3. The `depth` variable used within the function logic is not consistently updated based on the input.

To fix the bug, the following corrections can be made:

1. Remove the redundant condition `if not is_decorator`.

2. Simplify the logic within the `if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class` block to make it more readable and maintainable.

3. Ensure that the `depth` variable is updated consistently to reflect the actual depth of the current line.

Here's the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = min(current_line.leaves[0].prefix.count("\n"), 2) if current_line.leaves else 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
