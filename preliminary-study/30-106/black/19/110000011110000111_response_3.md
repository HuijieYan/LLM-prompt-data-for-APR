The error message indicates that there is an issue with the formatting of the output. The `assertFormatEqual` function is comparing the expected output with the actual output and it is failing.

The potential error location within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function could be that the function is not handling empty lines and decorators correctly. This is evident from the error message, which shows that there are extra empty lines present where there should not be.

The bug occurs because the `_maybe_empty_lines` function does not handle the insertion of empty lines correctly, especially when it comes to decorators and flow control statements.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles the insertion of empty lines before or after decorators, flow control statements, and other types of code blocks.

Here's the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and not current_line.is_decorator
        and not current_line.is_def
        and not current_line.is_class
        and not current_line.is_flow_control
        and not current_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_yield
    ):
        # No need to insert empty lines
        return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators
            return 0, 0
        else:
            # Insert two empty lines before decorators
            return 2, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control or current_line.is_import or current_line.is_yield:
        return 1, 0

    # Default case
    return 0, 0
```

In the corrected code, we explicitly handle the cases where empty lines should or should not be inserted based on the type of code block. This should resolve the issue with the extra empty lines, as indicated in the error message.
