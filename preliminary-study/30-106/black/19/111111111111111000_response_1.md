The issue is occurring in the `EmptyLineTracker` class. There is no `fs` or `ll` in the provided code, so the error is likely related to these missing variables.

I will correct the `EmptyLineTracker` class by updating the `_maybe_empty_lines` method with the expected variable types and return value based on the provided input parameters and expected output.

* Keep in mind that I will not be able to test this as I do not have the entire context and dependencies required to run this code. The bug could also be caused by other parts of the code or by missing information in the input parameters and expected results.


```python
from typing import Tuple
# Relative function's signature in this file
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    self.previous_defs = self.previous_defs or []
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

Note: This is a potential fix based on the information provided, but since I don't have the complete context of the code and the values of `fs` and `ll` are not provided, this fix may not completely solve the issue. It is recommended to run the updated function and the test function with proper inputs to verify if the issue is resolved.
