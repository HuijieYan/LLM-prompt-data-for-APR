The error message from the test function `test_comment_in_decorator` indicates that there are discrepancies between the expected and actual outputs when comparing two strings. The error occurred at line 633 in the `test_black.py` file.

Upon analyzing the provided source code, the buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to have issues with handling newlines and empty lines. The function is supposed to return the number of potential extra empty lines before and after the currently processed line. However, based on the error message, it seems that the function's logic for handling newlines and empty lines is flawed, leading to unexpected output.

The potential error location within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function could be in the section where it manipulates the `current_line` and determines the number of empty lines.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to accurately handle the cases where empty lines, decorators, and other line features are encountered.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function `_maybe_empty_lines`:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    after = 0
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        before = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), before)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    depth = current_line.depth
    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is not None and not self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            after = 1
        return before, after
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        after = 1
    return before, after
```

This corrected function ensures that the handling of newlines, decorators, and other line features is done accurately, thereby resolving the bug associated with the test case.
