The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the section where the function is attempting to clone the layers of the original model. This section may be encountering issues due to the way it handles layer instantiation and mapping input tensors to corresponding layers.

The bug occurs because the function seems to struggle with the creation and mapping of new layers and input tensors. It fails to properly clone layers and handle input tensors when attempting to reproduce the behavior of the original model. This results in a faulty 'Model' object being returned at the end of the function.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that new layers are correctly instantiated from the configuration of the original layers. Additionally, the mapping of input tensors to corresponding layers needs to be managed properly in order to reproduce the behavior of the original model accurately.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input
import tensorflow.keras.backend as K
import numpy as np

def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    
    if input_tensors is None:
        input_layers = []
        input_tensors = []
        for layer in model.layers:
            input_layer = Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape, dtype=layer.dtype, sparse=layer.sparse, name=layer.name)
            input_layers.append(input_layer)

        for i, layer in enumerate(input_layers):
            input_tensors.append(input_layer[i])

    output_tensors = model(input_tensors)
    
    return Model(inputs=input_tensors, outputs=output_tensors, name=model.name)
```
