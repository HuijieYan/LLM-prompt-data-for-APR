The error occurs in the `_clone_functional_model` function when it tries to compute the output tensors for the model. The issue seems to be related to the usage of a Lambda layer with multiple outputs and the absence of mask support for the Lambda layer.

It appears that the bug lies in the section of the code where it computes the output tensors and masks. Specifically, the issue is related to handling Lambda layers with multiple outputs and the absence of mask support for these layers.

One possible approach to fix this bug would be to handle Lambda layers with multiple outputs differently. Instead of relying on the mask support of the layer, the function can be modified to handle multiple outputs from the Lambda layer without considering the masks. Since Lambda layers do not support masks, the code needs to be adjusted to accommodate this limitation.

Additionally, the way the computed_data and output_tensors are handled might need to be changed to correctly handle multiple output tensors from the Lambda layer.

Below is the corrected code for the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
from tensorflow.keras import Model, Input
from tensorflow.keras import backend as K
from keras.layers import Lambda
import numpy as np

def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    """Clone a functional `Model` instance.

    Model cloning is similar to calling a model on new inputs,
    except that it creates new layers (and thus new weights) instead
    of sharing the weights of the existing layers.

    # Arguments
        model: Instance of `Model`.
        input_tensors: optional list of input tensors
            to build the model upon. If not provided,
            placeholders will be created.

    # Returns
        An instance of `Model` reproducing the behavior
        of the original model, on top of new inputs tensors,
        using newly instantiated weights.

    # Raises
        ValueError: in case of invalid `model` argument value.
    """
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    # rest of the original code...

    # Iterated over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    depth_keys = list(model._nodes_by_depth.keys())
    depth_keys.sort(reverse=True)
    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # Recover the corresponding layer.
            layer = node.outbound_layer

            # Get or create layer.
            if layer not in layer_map:
                # Clone layer.
                new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
                layer_map[layer] = new_layer
                layer = new_layer
            else:
                # Reuse previously cloned layer.
                layer = layer_map[layer]
                # Don't call InputLayer multiple times.
                if isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
                    continue

            # Gather inputs to call the new layer.
            reference_input_tensors = node.input_tensors
            reference_output_tensors = node.output_tensors

            # Handle Lambda layers with multiple outputs
            computed_data = []
            for x in reference_input_tensors:
                if x in tensor_map:
                    computed_data.append(tensor_map[x])

            # Call layer.
            if node.arguments:
                kwargs = node.arguments
            else:
                kwargs = {}
            computed_tensors = [x[0] for x in computed_data]
            output_tensors = to_list(layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs))

            # Update tensor_map.
            for x, y in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors):
                tensor_map[x] = y

    # rest of the original code...
```

The above corrected code takes into account the multiple output tensors from the Lambda layer and handles them appropriately without relying on mask support. Additionally, the output_tensors are correctly updated in the tensor_map for further processing.

This updated code should address the issue and provide the expected behavior for functional model cloning.
