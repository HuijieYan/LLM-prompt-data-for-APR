The test case involves creating a model, cloning it using the `clone_model` function, and then using `multi_gpu_model` with `cpu_relocation=True`. The bug occurs when using `clone_model`, leading to an assertion error "Could not compute output Tensor".

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the section where the output masks are being computed. It seems that the error is related to the fact that the `Lambda` layer doesn't support using masks, causing the `layer.compute_mask` to always return `None`.

The reason behind the bug is that the `clone_model` function does not handle the case where a layer with multiple outputs, without mask support, is used in the model. This causes the assertion error when computing the output tensor.

To fix the bug, the `clone_model` function needs to be modified to handle cases where a layer with multiple outputs and no mask support is used in the model. One approach to fix this bug is to check for mask support in the layers during the cloning process, and handle the computation of output tensors and masks accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
