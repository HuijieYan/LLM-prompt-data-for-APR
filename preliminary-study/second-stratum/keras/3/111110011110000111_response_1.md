1. The test case `test_clone_functional_model_with_multi_outputs` is designed to test the `clone_model` function in the `keras.models` module. The error occurs when trying to clone a model with multiple input and output layers. The `clone_model` function raises an error indicating that it could not compute the output tensor of the `SwapLayer` in the cloned model.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the part where it iterates over every node in the model and attempts to compute the output tensors for the new model.

3. The bug occurs because the function does not handle properly the case where a layer has multiple output tensors without mask support, which results in the inability to compute the output tensors for the cloned model.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the function to handle cases where a layer has multiple output tensors without mask support. This might involve creating a mechanism to handle such scenarios and allow for the computation of output tensors even without mask support.
   - Implement a check to identify layers that do not support masks and handle them differently in the cloning process.

5. Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (other parts of the function)

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    # Iterated over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    depth_keys = list(model._nodes_by_depth.keys())
    depth_keys.sort(reverse=True)
    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
      
            layer = node.outbound_layer

            if layer not in layer_map:
                new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
                layer_map[layer] = new_layer
                layer = new_layer
            else:
                layer = layer_map[layer]
                if isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
                    continue
    
            reference_input_tensors = node.input_tensors
            reference_output_tensors = node.output_tensors

            computed_data = []  # List of tuples (input, mask).
            for x in reference_input_tensors:
                if x in tensor_map:
                    computed_data.append(tensor_map[x])

            if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
                kwargs = node.arguments if node.arguments else {}
                computed_tensors = [x[0] for x in computed_data]
                output_tensors = to_list(layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs))
                
                for x, y in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors):
                    tensor_map[x] = (y, None)

    output_tensors = [tensor_map[x][0] for x in model.outputs]
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

In the corrected code:
- The computation of output tensors and handling of multiple output tensors for each layer have been refactored.
- A check is added to ensure that the function can correctly compute the output tensors for the new model, even when dealing with layers that do not support masks.
