The error is likely occurring in the loop that iterates over the nodes in the reference model, in depth order. It seems that the bug may be related to the `layer` object not being handled correctly when cloning new layers.

The bug occurs because the code does not handle the case where the layer is an `InputLayer`. This results in incorrect propagation of tensors and masks, leading to the error.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the `InputLayer` case and ensure that the tensors and masks are propagated correctly.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    """Clone a functional `Model` instance.

    Model cloning is similar to calling a model on new inputs,
    except that it creates new layers (and thus new weights) instead
    of sharing the weights of the existing layers.

    # Arguments
        model: Instance of `Model`.
        input_tensors: optional list of input tensors
            to build the model upon. If not provided,
            placeholders will be created.

    # Returns
        An instance of `Model` reproducing the behavior
        of the original model, on top of new inputs tensors,
        using newly instantiated weights.

    # Raises
        ValueError: in case of invalid `model` argument value.
    """
    # (code for checking the validity of model argument remains unchanged)

    # (code for handling input_tensors and caching input layers remains unchanged)

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)

    for depth in sorted(list(model._nodes_by_depth.keys()), reverse=True):
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            layer = node.outbound_layer

            # Get or create layer.
            if layer not in layer_map:
                # Clone layer.
                new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
                layer_map[layer] = new_layer
                layer = new_layer
            else:
                # Reuse previously cloned layer.
                layer = layer_map[layer]

            if isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
                continue

            # Rest of the code for calling and propagating tensors remains unchanged

    # Rest of the code for checking and returning new model instance remains unchanged
```

In this corrected code, we added a condition to skip over the `InputLayer` and continue to the next iteration of the loop if the layer is an instance of `InputLayer`. This helps in correctly handling the propagation of tensors and masks when cloning the model.
