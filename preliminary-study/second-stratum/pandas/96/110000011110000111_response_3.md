The error message indicates that there is a ValueError being raised during the validation of the frequency of the DatetimeIndex.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely around the logic related to adjusting the datetime based on business hours, especially considering the use of the CustomBusinessHour frequency with holidays.

The bug occurs because the code does not properly handle the presence of holidays when calculating the date range. As a result, the date_range function produces an unexpected number of periods when holidays are included.

To fix the bug, the code should be modified to correctly handle the inclusion of holidays when calculating the date range using CustomBusinessHour frequency.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour
import pandas as pd

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, pd.Timestamp):
        n = self.n
        adjusted_time = other

        freq = CustomBusinessHour(start=self.start, end=self.end, holidays=self.holidays)

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() not in self.end or not freq.onOffset(other):
                adjusted_time = freq.apply(adjusted_time)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                adjusted_time = adjusted_time - pd.Timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not freq.onOffset(other):
                adjusted_time = freq.apply(adjusted_time)
                adjusted_time = freq.rollback(adjusted_time)

        return adjusted_time
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected function, we utilize the CustomBusinessHour frequency directly to adjust the datetime based on business hours and holidays. This will ensure that the date range is calculated correctly even when holidays are included.
