The error occurs in the `apply` method of the class. It seems that when using the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency with holidays, the `apply` method is not adjusting the dates correctly, leading to extra periods being generated.

The issue may be related to the adjustments made to the `other` datetime variable inside the `apply` method, specifically when checking holidays and adjusting to the next opening time. It seems that the adjustments made to the `other` datetime variable are not handling the holidays properly.

To fix this bug, you can review the logic for adjusting dates in the `apply` method, specifically the parts related to handling holidays and adjusting the `other` variable when going to the next opening time.

Here's the corrected `apply` method:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        other = pd.Timestamp(other)
        
        if n >= 0:
            while True:
                if other.day_name() in ["Friday", "Saturday"] or other.normalize() in self.holidays:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    break
        else:
            while True:
                if other.day_name() in ["Saturday", "Sunday"] or other.normalize() in self.holidays:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    break
        
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            days = pd.offsets.BDay(bd)
            other = pd.Timestamp(other + days)

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = pd.Timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain > pd.Timedelta(0):
                bhour_ = (self._next_opening_time(other) - other)
                if bhour_remain < bhour_:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = pd.Timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour_
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        else:
            while bhour_remain > pd.Timedelta(0):
                bhour_ = (other - self._prev_opening_time(other))
                if bhour_remain < bhour_:
                    other -= bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = pd.Timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour_
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

        return pd.Timestamp(other)
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected code:
- I've used the `pd.Timestamp` function to ensure that "other" is converted to a pandas Timestamp object for consistency.
- I've adjusted the logic to properly handle holidays and adjust the dates to the next opening time or the previous opening time based on the value of "n".
- I've used Pandas' TimeDelta and BDay for handling date adjustments to simplify the logic and improve readability.

This should address the issue related to generating extra periods when using holidays with the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency in the `apply` method.
