The problem here seems to be related to the `CustomBusinessHour` offset frequency where the test is not able to validate the frequency against the values of a given DatetimeIndex. The error message indicates that the inferred frequency does not conform to the passed frequency.

The bug is likely within the `apply` method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class which is unable to handle the `CustomBusinessHour` offset frequency correctly. This method is meant to apply business hour logic to a given datetime and adjust it accordingly, but it seems to be failing when dealing with the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency.

To fix this bug, the `apply` method needs to handle the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency properly so that it can adjust the given datetime according to the custom business hours. 

Here's the corrected code for the `apply` method:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # ... existing code ...

        if isinstance(freq, CustomBusinessHour):
            # Adjust other according to the custom business hour frequency
            return freq.rollback(other)
    
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected code, we check if the frequency `freq` is an instance of `CustomBusinessHour`. If it is, we use the `rollback` method of the frequency to adjust the given datetime according to the custom business hours. This change should help in handling the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency correctly within the `apply` method.
