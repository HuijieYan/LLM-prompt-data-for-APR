The error message is indicating a problem with the frequency validation for the `CustomBusinessHour` offset. It seems that the `is_period_dtype` function is not handling the `CustomBusinessHour` properly, leading to the validation error.

The potential error location within the buggy code is the `CustomBusinessHour` class and how it's applied within the `apply` function.

The bug is occurring because the `apply` function does not properly handle the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency, leading to a mismatch between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency.

To fix the bug, the `apply` function should be modified to correctly handle the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency and ensure that the inferred frequency matches the passed frequency.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # the code for handling CustomBusinessHour frequency
        if isinstance(self, CustomBusinessHour):
            start_hour = self.start
            end_hour = self.end
            delta = timedelta(hours=1)  # Default hour frequency
            other_hour = other.replace(minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)  # Floor the datetime to the nearest hour
            if other_hour.time() < start_hour:
                other_hour = other_hour.replace(hour=start_hour.hour)
            elif other_hour.time() >= end_hour:
                other_hour = other_hour.replace(hour=end_hour.hour)
            return other_hour
			
        # the rest of the function remains the same
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
