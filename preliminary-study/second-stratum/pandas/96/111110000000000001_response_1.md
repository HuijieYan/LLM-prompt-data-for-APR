The potential error location within the problematic function is the if statement at the beginning of the function. The bug occurs because the `other` argument is being checked using `isinstance` method against `datetime` class, which should be `datetime.datetime` instead.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that `datetime` is not being compared properly using the `isinstance` method. The `datetime` class exists in the `datetime` module, so it should be compared against `datetime.datetime`.

To fix the bug, the `isinstance` check should be modified to compare against `datetime.datetime` instead of just `datetime`. Also, it would be a good practice to add a try-except block to catch any potential AttributeError when accessing the nanosecond attribute of the `other` object.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    try:
        if isinstance(other, datetime.datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
            other = datetime.datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
            # rest of the function remains the same
            # ...
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
    except AttributeError:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
