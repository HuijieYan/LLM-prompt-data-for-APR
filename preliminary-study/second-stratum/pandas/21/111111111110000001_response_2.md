The error message indicates that the test case is failing because it did not raise a KeyError as expected.

The problematic function is `_get_with` within the `Series` class. The issue is likely related to how the function handles the `key` parameter. It seems that the function is not correctly processing the input `key` in certain cases, leading to unexpected behavior and the failure of the test cases.

One potential reason for the bug is that the function does not handle the different types of `key` inputs consistently, causing unexpected behavior and errors when trying to retrieve values based on the key.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should be modified to handle the different types of `key` inputs consistently and accurately.

Here's the corrected implementation of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected implementation, we added an `else` block to handle any other types of `key` inputs that were not covered by the previous conditions. This ensures that all types of `key` inputs are handled properly, reducing the chance of unexpected behavior and errors.

This correction should address the inconsistencies in handling different `key` inputs and make the `_get_with` function more robust.
