The bug in this code causes a `KeyError` to not be raised when it is expected in the test function `test_getitem_no_matches`.

The issue appears to be within the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. The function tries to handle different types of keys (like slices, dataframes, tuples, etc.) but seems to have a problem recognizing the type of the key and selecting the appropriate handling.

The function should be updated to properly handle the different types of keys and make sure that the correct type of indexing operation is performed based on the type of the key.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not pd.api.types.is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key = pd.api.types.to_list(key)
    
    key_type = pd.api.types.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, pd.Index):
        return self.reindex(key)
    
    # handle the dup indexing case
    return self.loc[key]
```

These changes ensure that the correct type of indexing operation is performed based on the type of the key, and the function should now raise the `KeyError` as expected in the test case.
