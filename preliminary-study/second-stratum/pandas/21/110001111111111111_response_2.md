The bug seems to be occurring in the `_get_with` function. The error occurs when a list is passed as the key to the Series and it is treated differently from other indexers.

The reason behind the bug is that the `key` variable, if not an array-like object, is converted into a list. The function then checks the type of `key` for further processing based on the array-like or list-like nature of the input. The error occurs when the 'list' key is treated differently, leading to a KeyError when accessing the index.

To fix the bug, the code should treat the 'list' key in the same way as other array-like objects and perform the same processing as it does for other indexers.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the conditional checks for the type of `key` to handle the 'list' case in the same way as other array-like objects. This might involve adjusting the conditional checks and the subsequent processing steps to handle the 'list' key properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key = list(key)  # Convert key to list
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected code should handle the 'list' key in the same way as other array-like inputs and resolve the KeyError issue when accessing the index.
