The error message from the test function indicates that the test failed to raise a KeyError when using the `ser[key]` syntax with a list.

The bug seems to be in the `_get_with` function, specifically in the part where it checks the type of the key. The if statement for a non-list-like key may be mistakenly assuming that the key is a valid index, leading to an incorrect flow of the program.

This bug occurs because when indexing a Series with a list, the `_get_with` function tries to convert the list into a form that can be used to index the Series, and the conversion is not happening correctly in the current implementation.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the case when the key is a list. We can modify the code to consistently treat the list-like key as a list and perform the indexing operation accordingly. Additionally, we need to ensure that the KeyErrors are raised consistently when a list-like key does not match any index in the Series.

Here is the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
    
    key = list(key)
    return self.loc[key]
```

With this correction, the function will consistently handle list-like keys, raising a KeyError if the elements in the key do not match the index of the Series.

The corrected function should address the inconsistency in handling various types of indexers, ensuring consistent behavior and error handling.
