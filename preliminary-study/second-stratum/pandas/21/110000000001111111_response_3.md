The bug in the provided function seems to occur due to the inconsistent behavior when the input `key` is a list. In the given test cases, the behavior of the function needs to be consistent with how it handles the input when it is a list.

The error message "KeyError: "None of [Index(['C'], dtype='object')] are in the [index]" indicates that when the input `key` is a list, the function is not able to handle it correctly and misses the matching index, resulting in the KeyError.

To fix the bug, we can modify the section of the code where the type of the input `key` is a list. We need to ensure that the list input is handled in a manner consistent with the behavior of other types of indexers.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type in ("integer", "string"):
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected code, the handling of list inputs as indexers is modified to ensure consistency with the behavior of other types of indexers. This should fix the inconsistency and the KeyError issue.
