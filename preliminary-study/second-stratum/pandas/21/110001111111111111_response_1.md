The issue seems to be with the different handling of list indexers compared to other array-like indexers in the `Series` class when using the `ser[key]` notation. This is leading to inconsistent behavior and contradictory results when using different types of indexers.

The error message in the test function indicates that the `KeyError` is not being raised as expected when using a list as the indexer.

The potential error location is within the `_get_with` method of the `Series` class, which is responsible for handling different types of indexers when using the `ser[key]` notation.

The reason behind the bug is that the `_get_with` method is treating list indexers differently from other indexers, leading to inconsistency in behavior. This is causing the `KeyError` to be raised for list indexers but not for other indexers.

One possible approach to fix this issue is to modify the `_get_with` method to handle all types of indexers uniformly. This can involve updating the logic to ensure that the `KeyError` is consistently raised for all types of indexers when the key does not match any values in the index.

Here is the corrected code for the `_get_with` method:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, pd.Index, pd.Series)):
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
    else:
        # handle other types of indexers
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        else:
            # handle other cases
            return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected code ensures consistent handling of different types of indexers, resulting in uniform behavior and error handling. This should address the inconsistency and resolve the bug reported in the test function.
