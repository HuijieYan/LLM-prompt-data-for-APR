The issue seems to be related to the different behavior when indexing a Series using a list. When the Series is indexed with a list, it raises a KeyError, while indexing with other array-like types does not. The error message indicates that the behavior when indexing with a list is inconsistent with the behavior when indexing with other array-like types.

The bug is likely occurring within the `_get_with` function where it tries to handle the different cases for indexing. It seems that the condition for handling list indexers is causing the KeyError to be raised in this case.

The issue is likely happening because the code is treating list indexers differently from other array-like indexers, resulting in the inconsistent behavior.

To fix the bug, the code should handle list indexers consistently with other array-like indexers. The approach could involve modifying the condition for handling list indexers to align with the behavior of other array-like indexers.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function with the problematic condition modified to handle list indexers consistently:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray) or isinstance(key, Series) or isinstance(key, ExtensionArray):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By modifying the condition for handling list indexers, the corrected `_get_with` function should now handle list indexers consistently with other array-like indexers and no longer raise a KeyError for the given test cases.
