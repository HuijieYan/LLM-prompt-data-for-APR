The bug occurs when the Series is indexed with a list containing a value that is not present in the Series. In this case, the error message "None of [Index(['C'], dtype='object')] are in the [index]" is raised, which is inconsistent with the behavior when indexing with other array-like objects.

The issue seems to be in the `_get_with` function implementation where the handling of list indexers is different from other array-like indexers. This inconsistency in behavior is causing the error.

To fix the bug, the handling of list indexers should be made consistent with other array-like indexers. The behavior when indexing with a list should align with the behavior when indexing with other array-like objects.

Additionally, the logic for determining whether the indexer should be treated as positional or label-based should be reviewed to ensure consistency.

Here's the corrected `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif not isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, list, tuple)):
        if not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, (list, tuple, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected code ensures that the handling of list indexers is consistent with that of other array-like indexers, and the logic for determining positional or label-based indexing is maintained.
