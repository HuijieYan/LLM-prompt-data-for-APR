The error message indicates that the `ser[key]` operation is failing to raise a KeyError as expected. The test is trying to access a non-existent key in the Series which should raise a KeyError, but the operation is failing to do so.

The potential error location within the `_get_with` function is in the code block handling `if not is_list_like(key):`. It seems that there might be a discrepancy in the handling of list-like indexers which is causing the KeyError to not be raised as expected.

The bug seems to occur because the handling of list indexers is inconsistent compared to other indexers like arrays or Index objects. This inconsistency leads to different behaviors for the same operation, such as raising KeyError in some cases and not raising it in others.

To fix this bug, the handling of list indexers should be made consistent with other indexers like arrays or Index objects. The behavior should be uniform for all indexers to ensure that operations like `ser[key]` consistently raise a KeyError when accessing non-existent keys.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    # Updated handling for list-like key
    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    # Rest of the code remains the same
    # ...
```

By updating the handling of list-like keys to use `self.loc[key]`, we can ensure that the behavior is consistent with other indexers, and it will raise a KeyError when trying to access non-existent keys. This should fix the inconsistency and make the behavior of the function uniform across different types of indexers.
