Based on the test case and error message, it appears that the bug is likely in the `_get_with` function where it fails to handle the key parameter correctly and raise a KeyError.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the part where it handles the key parameter and tries to match it with the index of the Series data.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function does not handle the key parameter correctly and does not check for edge cases such as when the key is not present in the index.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to ensure that it handles different types of keys properly, conducts appropriate checks for the presence of the key in the index, and raises appropriate errors when necessary.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected code, key handling is restructured to ensure that different types of keys are appropriately handled and that checks for the presence of the key in the index are conducted. This should fix the bug and prevent the KeyError from occurring.
