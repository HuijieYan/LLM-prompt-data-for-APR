The bug seems to be occurring within the `_get_with` method of the `Series` class. The issue is that the function is treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior.

In the provided test cases, the `ser` Series is accessed using different types of indexers (`box`) and the function should behave consistently for all types of indexers. However, it seems to treat list indexers differently from array-like indexers, leading to a KeyError when using a list indexer.

The reason behind this bug might be a conditional logic within the `_get_with` method that handles different types of indexers inconsistently. The conditional statements within the `_get_with` method need to be revised to treat all types of indexers consistently.

One possible approach for fixing this bug is to ensure that the conditional statements within the `_get_with` method handle all types of indexers in a consistent manner. This could involve restructuring the conditional logic to have uniform behavior for list indexers, array-like indexers, and other types of indexers. Additionally, ensuring that the `ser.loc[key]` will raises the same error for all cases.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, pd.Index, pd.Series)):
        key = list(key)
        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        raise KeyError(f"None of [{key}] are in the [index]")
```

In this corrected code, we treat all types of indexers uniformly, and if the key is not found in the index, a `KeyError` is raised consistently across all types of indexers.
