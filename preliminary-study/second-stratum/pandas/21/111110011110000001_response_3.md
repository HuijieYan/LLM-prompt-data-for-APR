The error occurs when the function `test_getitem_no_matches` is being executed. This test function is supposed to check the behavior of the `ser[key]` operation when the key doesn't have any matches in the Series index. However, the error message indicates that the expected error (KeyError) was not raised, which suggests a potential issue with the `_get_with` function.

Upon reviewing the `_get_with` function, it seems that there are multiple conditional blocks to handle different types of keys, such as `slice`, `DataFrame`, `tuple`, etc. However, there is no explicit handling for the case where the key doesn't have any matches in the index.

The bug occurs because when there are no matches in the index, the code falls through all the conditional blocks and reaches the end of the function without raising a KeyError. Therefore, the function should explicitly handle the case where the key doesn't have any matches in the index.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to add a conditional block at the end of the `_get_with` function to raise a KeyError if no matches are found in the index.

Here is the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    result = self.reindex(key)
    
    if result.isna().all():
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
    return result
```

In the corrected code, a new conditional block after the `reindex` operation checks if all values are missing (NaN). If all values are missing, it raises a KeyError with an appropriate message.
