The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statement checking for NaN values in the "astype_nansafe" function. There is a potential bug related to converting non-finite values (NA or inf) to an integer which could lead to a ValueError.

The bug occurs because the condition for converting non-finite values to an integer is not handled properly. The function does not check for NaN or inf values before attempting to convert to an integer, which can lead to a ValueError.

To fix the bug, the function should include a check for NaN or inf values before attempting to convert to an integer.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # check for NaN or inf values before converting to an integer
    if np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.floating) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        if not np.isfinite(arr).all():
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert non-finite values (NA or inf) to integer")

    # ... omitted code ...
```
