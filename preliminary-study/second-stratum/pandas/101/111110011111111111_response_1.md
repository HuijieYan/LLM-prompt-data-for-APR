The error occurs when attempting to cast a categorical or categorical index containing NaN values to an integer dtype. When trying to convert a categorical series back into an integer column, it converts NaN to an unexpected negative integer value.

The bug is likely located in the section of the function that handles datetime, timedelta, floating, and object dtypes. The issue arises when casting NaN values to integer, which should instead result in NaN. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the section of the function that handles the conversion of datetime/timedelta array of objects to coerce to a proper dtype and then recall `astype_nansafe`. We need to ensure that when casting to an integer, any NaN values should remain as NaN, rather than being converted to a negative integer.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy=True, skipna=False):
    if not isinstance(dtype, np.dtype):
        dtype = np.dtype(dtype)

    if str(dtype) in ("int64", "Int64"):
        arr = arr.astype(object)
        arr[arr is np.nan] = None
        return arr.astype(dtype)

    # rest of the function remains the same
```

In this corrected code, we explicitly handle the case for int64 dtype and make sure that NaN values are converted to None before casting to the specified dtype. This approach ensures that when casting NaN values to an integer, they are preserved as NaN.
