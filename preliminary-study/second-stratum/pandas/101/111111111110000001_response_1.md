The error in the function `astype_nansafe` is likely related to the handling of NaT (Not a Time) values, which are used in the test function to check if the function raises a ValueError when trying to convert NaT to an integer type.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle NaT values properly. When trying to convert a NaT to an integer type, the function should raise a ValueError, but it fails to do so.

To fix this bug, the function `astype_nansafe` needs to be modified to correctly handle the conversion of NaT values to integer types. This can be achieved by adding a specific check and raising a ValueError when the input contains NaT values.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    if np.isnat(arr).any() and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")
    else:
        return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)
```

In the corrected function, we have added a check for NaT values using `np.isnat(arr).any()` and then raised a ValueError if the input contains NaT values and the desired dtype is an integer type. Otherwise, we proceed with the conversion using `arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)`.
