The error occurs because the function astype_nansafe is not handling the conversion of NaN values properly when casting to an integer type. This results in the test cases failing as the function does not raise the expected ValueError when trying to cast NaN values to an integer.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle the conversion of NaN values to integer types properly. This can be done by adding an explicit check for NaN values and raising a ValueError with an appropriate message, as per the expected behavior in the test cases.

Below is the corrected code for the astype_nansafe function:

```python
import numpy as np

def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy=True, skipna=False):
    if np.any(pd.isna(arr)) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaN values to integer")

    # rest of the function's code
    # ...

```

With this modification, the function now explicitly checks for NaN values in the array and raises a ValueError if an integer dtype is being used for the conversion. This ensures that the function properly handles the casting of NaN values to integer types as expected in the test cases.

The corrected function should resolve the bug, and the associated test cases should pass without raising any errors.
