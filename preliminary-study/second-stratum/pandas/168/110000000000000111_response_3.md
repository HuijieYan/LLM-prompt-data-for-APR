The issue appears to be related to using the `groupby()` function with the `axis=1` argument to group the data by columns, but encountering a KeyError.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the section where it checks if the passed `key` is in the group_axis (which represents the columns). This section should handle the case where the key is a column name.

The bug occurs because the function is not correctly handling the case where the `key` is a column name when grouping along the columns (`axis=1`).

To fix the bug, we can modify the code to correctly handle the case where the `key` is a column name when grouping along the columns.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    ...

    """

    if axis == 1 and isinstance(key, str):
        key = obj[key]

    ...

    # the rest of the function remains unchanged

    ...
```

In the corrected code, we check if the `axis` is 1 and the `key` is a string (indicating a column name). If both conditions are true, we replace the `key` with the actual column from the DataFrame. This modification ensures that when grouping along the columns, the function correctly handles the case where the `key` is a column name.

This correction should address the bug and allow the `groupby()` function to correctly group the data by columns.
