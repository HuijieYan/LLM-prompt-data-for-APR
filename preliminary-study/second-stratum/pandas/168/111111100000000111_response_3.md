The error message in the GitHub issue indicates that the `groupby` function does not offer implicit selection by column name(s). This suggests that the bug may be related to how the function handles grouping by column names.

The potential error location in the code is the block where the `is_in_axis` and `is_in_obj` functions are defined, as well as the subsequent logic that determines how to create the groupings for the `BaseGrouper`.

The bug appears to be caused by an issue with how the code handles grouping by column names. The code does not properly handle the case where the user wants to group by column names, leading to a `KeyError` when trying to group along columns.

To fix the bug, the code should be modified to properly handle grouping by column names. This may involve changes to the logic for checking if a key is present in the object's columns, as well as how the groupings are created for the `BaseGrouper`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj, key=None, axis=0, level=None, sort=True, observed=False, mutated=False, validate=True
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if axis == 1 and isinstance(key, str):
        if key not in obj.columns:
            raise KeyError(key)
        key = obj[key]

    # rest of the function code...

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

In this corrected code, we specifically check if the axis is 1 (indicating grouping by columns) and the key is a string. If both conditions are met, we check if the key exists in the object's columns and then assign the corresponding column to the `key` variable. This ensures that grouping by column names is handled correctly.
