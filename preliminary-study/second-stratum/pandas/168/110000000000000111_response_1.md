The error is occurring in the `_get_grouper` function where the grouping by columns is not working as expected.

The issue seems to be related to how the function processes the `axis` parameter and handles grouping by columns.

One potential reason for the bug could be that the function is not correctly identifying the axis when grouping by columns, resulting in the KeyError.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic within the `_get_grouper` function to properly handle the grouping by columns.

Here is the corrected code for the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
import warnings

def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    Corrected implementation of the _get_grouper function
    """
    if axis == 1:  # Check if grouping by columns
        if key is None:  # If key is not provided, group by columns implicitly
            key = obj.columns.tolist()
        else:
            if isinstance(key, str):  # If key is a single column name
                key = [key]
            if not all(col in obj.columns for col in key):  # Check if all keys are valid column names
                raise KeyError("One or more keys are not valid column names")

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)
    # ... (rest of the function logic)

# The rest of the original function remains the same
```
In this corrected code, we check if the `axis` parameter is 1, indicating that we are grouping by columns. If that's the case, we handle the key appropriately by either using all column names if the key is not provided, or checking if the specified keys are valid column names.

This should address the issue of explicitly selecting groupings by columns and resolve the KeyError.
