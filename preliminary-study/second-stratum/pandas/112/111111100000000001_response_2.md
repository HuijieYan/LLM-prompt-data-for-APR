The potential error in the problematic function is that it is trying to access the `is_overlapping` attribute directly as if it were a method, but it is not.

The reason for the bug is that `is_overlapping` is not being called as a method but rather accessed as an attribute, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

To fix this, we need to call `is_overlapping` as a method by adding parentheses after the attribute.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():  # call is_overlapping as a method
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    # rest of the code remains the same
    # ...
```

In the corrected code, we have added parentheses after `is_overlapping` to call it as a method.
