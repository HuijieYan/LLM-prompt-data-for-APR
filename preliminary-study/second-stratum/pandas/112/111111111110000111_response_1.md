The error message indicates that the `get_indexer` method is failing due to a "No matching signature found" error. This suggests that there might be an issue with the method signature or the way the method is being called.

Upon analyzing the provided code, it seems that the issue might be related to the method signature of `get_indexer` and the way it is called with the `target_as_index.values` argument. The error message suggests a TypeError with no matching signature found.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be that the `get_indexer` method is not correctly handling the input argument `target_as_index.values`, which is causing the "No matching signature found" error.

To fix this bug, the problematic method `get_indexer` should be reviewed and updated as necessary to ensure that it correctly handles the `target` argument, specifically in the case where the input is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target: Any, method: Optional[str] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    # Add a check for CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex
    if isinstance(target, pd.CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target.categories, pd.IntervalIndex):
        target_as_index = target.categories
    else:
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    # Rest of the method implementation...
    # (Keep the rest of the method implementation as is)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In this corrected code, we first check if the `target` input is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. If it is, we extract the original IntervalIndex from the CategoricalIndex. This ensures that the `get_indexer` method can handle CategoricalIndexes created from IntervalIndexes.

After making this modification, the `get_indexer` method should be able to handle the input argument `target` correctly and avoid the "No matching signature found" error.

After implementing this fix, the provided test case should no longer result in a TypeError, and the `round_interval_category_columns` test should pass without errors.
