The bug in the provided code is that the `get_indexer` function is defined twice in the same file, which is causing a conflict.

To fix this bug, one of the `get_indexer` functions should be removed and the code should be adjusted accordingly. Since the second `get_indexer` function seems to contain the actual implementation, it would be better to keep that and remove the first one.

Here is the corrected code with the duplicate function removed:

```python

    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file

    pass


# Removed the duplicated function

) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    # ... omitted code ...

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```
With this corrected code, the duplicate definition of the `get_indexer` function has been removed, resolving the conflict.
