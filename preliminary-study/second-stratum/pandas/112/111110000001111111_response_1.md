The error seems to be occurring in the `get_indexer` function. It's likely that the error is due to the presence of a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, which is causing the `TypeError: No matching signature found` when using the `round` method on the DataFrame.

The bug is occurring because the `get_indexer` function is not handling the case where the index is a CategoricalIndex created from an IntervalIndex. The function is not properly considering the case when the index is not a regular IntervalIndex.

To fix this issue, the `get_indexer` function should be modified to handle the case when the index is a CategoricalIndex created from an IntervalIndex. It should also ensure that the appropriate data type and matching signatures are used when performing calculations or operations.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function:

```python
# corrected get_indexer function
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if not isinstance(target, IntervalIndex) and not isinstance(target, CategoricalIndex):
        raise ValueError("Unsupported index type")

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    if isinstance(target, IntervalIndex):
        target_as_index = target
    elif isinstance(target, CategoricalIndex):
        target_as_index = target.categories
    else:
        raise ValueError("Unsupported index type")

    # rest of the function remains the same
```

This corrected function includes handling for the case when the index is a CategoricalIndex created from an IntervalIndex. It checks for the target type and then proceeds accordingly, ensuring that the appropriate data type and matching signatures are used for the calculations or operations.
