The issue with the provided function seems to arise from the fact that it is not handling the hierarchical columns appropriately. This is evident from the fact that the function tries to access levels and codes directly from the index without considering the hierarchical structure.

To fix this bug, you can modify the function to correctly handle hierarchical columns by accessing the levels and codes through `data.columns` and `data.columns.levels`, respectively, instead of directly accessing them through the `index`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    columns = data.columns

    clevels = [columns.levels[columns._get_level_number(name)] for name in clocs]
    ccodes = [columns.codes[columns._get_level_number(name)] for name in clocs]
    cnames = [name for name in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # rest of the function remains the same
    ...
```

By accessing the levels and codes from the `data.columns` attribute, we ensure that the hierarchical structure of the columns is correctly handled, which should resolve the issue encountered in the buggy function.
