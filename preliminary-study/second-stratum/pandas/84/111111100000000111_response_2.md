The issue seems to be related to unstacking a MultiIndex with tuple names. The error occurs when trying to unstack by specifying the tuple names.

The potential error location within the code is likely when trying to get the level number of the index with `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that it's not handling the tuple names in the MultiIndex correctly.

To fix the bug, the code should be modified to handle the tuple names correctly, ensuring that when using `index._get_level_number(i)`, it works for both single indices and tuple names.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
  if len(clocs) == 0:
      return data

  index = data.index

  if isinstance(index, pd.MultiIndex):
      levels = index.levels[0] if isinstance(index.levels[0][0], tuple) else index.levels
      clocs = [i if isinstance(i, tuple) else levels[i] for i in clocs]
  else:
      clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

  rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
  
  # Rest of the code remains unchanged
  # ...
```
