Potential Error Location: 
The function is trying to unstack a MultiIndex DataFrame or Series based on the specified column(s) using the `unstack` method. The bug might be related to how the function is handling the unstacking process and the creation of the new MultiIndex.

Reasons for the Bug: 
1. The handling of both Series and DataFrame might not be consistent throughout the function, leading to potential errors.
2. The creation of new MultiIndex might not be done correctly, resulting in issues with the final unstacked output.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure consistent handling of Series and DataFrame throughout the function.
2. Verify the correct creation of new MultiIndex based on the unstacked output.
3. Use proper checks to distinguish between Series and DataFrame to perform the unstacking accordingly.

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    
    if isinstance(data, Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```
