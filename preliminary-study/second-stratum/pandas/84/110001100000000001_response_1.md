The potential error location within the problematic function is the 'if rlocs == []' condition, which is leading to an error in the code.

The bug occurs because the condition 'if rlocs == []' is causing an index out of range error when attempting to access 'rlevels' and 'rcodes' later in the code. This happens because 'if rlocs == []' is true, then the code tries to access 'rlevels' and 'rcodes' as if they were non-empty, leading to an index out of range error.

To fix this bug, we can add a check to ensure that 'rlevels' and 'rcodes' are non-empty before accessing them.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if len(rlocs) == 0:  # Check if rlocs is non-empty
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
    # ...
```
