The function appears to be designed to unstack a DataFrame or Series based on the specified column levels. The bug in the provided function seems to stem from improperly handling the columns and their levels during the unstacking process.

Potential Error Location:
The potential error location could be in the section where the function checks whether the input data is a DataFrame with a MultiIndex. It then attempts to unstack the DataFrame based on the specified column levels.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug may be occurring due to incorrect handling of MultiIndex levels and codes during the unstacking process. This part of the function seems to be causing the error when attempting to unstack the DataFrame.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Properly handle the MultiIndex levels and codes during the unstacking process to ensure the DataFrame is unstacked correctly.
2. Check for the data type and structure of the input DataFrame before attempting to unstack it, especially when dealing with MultiIndex columns.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Checking if the data is a Series
    if isinstance(data, pd.Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs[0], fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        # If the data is a DataFrame with MultiIndex columns
        if isinstance(data.columns, pd.MultiIndex):
            result = data
            for i in range(len(clocs)):
                val = clocs[i]
                result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
                clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]
            return result
        else:
            dummy = data.copy()
            # Creating a dummy index for unstacking
            dummy_index = pd.MultiIndex.from_tuples(list(zip(*[index.get_level_values(i) for i in rlocs])), names=[index.names[i] for i in rlocs] + ["__placeholder__"])
            dummy.index = dummy_index
            unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```
