Based on the provided buggy function and the test cases, it seems that the error is occurring during the process of obtaining the level numbers for the index. The error message "KeyError: 'Level A not found'" suggests that the function is unable to find the specified level.

This is likely happening because the function is attempting to use a tuple of level names ("A", "a") directly as an index level, instead of utilizing the individual names within the tuple to obtain the level numbers.

To fix this issue, the function should separate the individual level names from the tuple and then use them to obtain the level numbers for the index. Once the level numbers are obtained, the function should proceed with unstacking the data based on the obtained level numbers.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Obtain the level numbers for the index based on the level names
    index = data.index
    level_numbers = [index._get_level_number(level) for level in clocs]

    # Perform unstacking based on the obtained level numbers
    unstacked = data.unstack(level_numbers, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

In this corrected code, we utilize the individual level names within the tuple `clocs` to obtain the level numbers, and then proceed with unstacking the data based on these level numbers. This should resolve the "KeyError" issue and correctly unstack the data based on the specified levels.
