The error is occurring when calling the `unstack` method on a Series with a MultiIndex. The error message indicates that the 'A' level is not found, which suggests that there is an issue with how the levels are being accessed or manipulated in the `_unstack_multiple` function.

The potential error location within the `_unstack_multiple` function seems to be in the following line:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```
This line is trying to get the level number for each element in `clocs`. It is likely that this line is causing the KeyError when it tries to access a level that does not exist.

The error occurs because of incorrect handling of MultiIndex levels and codes. The code is trying to manipulate the levels and codes directly, which can lead to inconsistencies and errors.

To fix the bug, one approach is to avoid manipulating the levels and codes directly and instead utilize the existing pandas functionality for unstacking MultiIndex objects.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```
In the corrected code, we are utilizing the `unstack` method of the DataFrame or Series object, which handles the unstacking of MultiIndex objects in a more robust way. This approach avoids the direct manipulation of levels and codes and should resolve the KeyError issue.
