The issue seems to be related to the handling of MultiIndex levels when unstacking. The error message indicates that there is an issue with identifying the level by name.

The problematic function in the stack trace is `_unstack_multiple`, specifically the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`. The error occurs because `_get_level_number` method is not able to correctly identify the level by its name.

The bug occurs because the function is assuming that the level names can be directly used to identify the level number, which is not the case for MultiIndex. Instead, we should use `index.names.index` to get the level number from the level name.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the level names are correctly matched to their corresponding level numbers. Then, we can use the level numbers to proceed with the unstacking operation.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index
    
    clocs = [index.names.index(i) for i in clocs]  # Get the level numbers from level names
    
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # ... rest of the function remains the same ...
```

With this corrected code, the function should be able to properly identify the level numbers from the level names and proceed with unstacking the data.
