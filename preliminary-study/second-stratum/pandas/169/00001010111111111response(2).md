The test case `test_quantile_empty_no_columns` is creating a DataFrame `df` with a single date column and then calling the `quantile` method with a specified quantile value of 0.5. This test case is expecting an empty result due to the absence of numeric data.

The error message indicates that there is an attempt to concatenate arrays, but there are no arrays to concatenate, leading to a `ValueError`.

The bug appears to be in the way the `quantile` method handles the scenario where no numeric data is present in the DataFrame. It seems that the method is not correctly handling the edge case of empty data, resulting in an attempt to concatenate empty arrays.

To fix this bug, the `quantile` method needs to be modified to appropriately handle the case where there is no numeric data in the DataFrame being operated on.

The corrected code for the `quantile` method is as follows:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    result = None
    if not data.empty:  # Check if data is not empty
        if is_transposed:
            data = data.T

        result = data._data.quantile(
            qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
        )

        if result.ndim == 2:
            result = self._constructor(result)
        else:
            result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

        if is_transposed:
            result = result.T

    return result
```

This corrected code first checks if the `data` is not empty before attempting any operations. If the data is empty, it returns `None`. If the data is not empty, it proceeds with the quantile computation as before. This change ensures that the method handles the scenario of empty data correctly without attempting any unnecessary operations.
