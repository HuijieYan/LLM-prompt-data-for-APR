The error message "ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate" suggests that there is an issue with concatenating arrays in the code.

Looking at the buggy function, it seems that the issue might be related to the `result` variable, which is supposed to be either a DataFrame or a Series based on the condition `if result.ndim == 2`. The error suggests that the result variable is empty and this causes a concatenation issue.

One possible approach to fixing this bug is to handle the case where the result is empty. We can modify the function to return an empty DataFrame or Series based on the shape of the result.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2 and not result.empty:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = pd.DataFrame(index=self.index, columns=self.columns) if result.empty else pd.Series(index=self.index)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In the corrected code, we handle the case where `result` is empty by returning an empty DataFrame or Series based on the shape of the result. This should prevent the concatenation error when the result is empty.
