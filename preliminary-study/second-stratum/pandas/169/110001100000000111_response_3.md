The bug appears to be in the `quantile` method of the DataFrame class. The reported issue is that when using the `quantile` method with a DataFrame containing datetime data, it raises a ValueError, while the equivalent method with a Series works fine.

The potential error location is within the `quantile` method in the `_constructor` function. The bug seems to be related to the concatenation of arrays, which is likely causing the ValueError.

The reason behind the bug is that the DataFrame's `quantile` method is not handling the datetime data properly, causing the ValueError when attempting to concatenate arrays.

To fix the bug, the `quantile` method needs to be modified to correctly handle datetime data and avoid triggering the concatenation issues. This may involve modifying the internal handling of datetime data within the method.

Here's the corrected code for the `quantile` method in the DataFrame class:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    # Additional handling for datetime data
    if isinstance(result, pd.Series) and hasattr(result.iloc[0], 'to_datetime'):
        # Convert the series values to datetime
        result = result.apply(pd.to_datetime)

    return result
```

The corrected code includes additional handling for datetime data. If the result is a Series and the values are datetime-like, they are converted to datetime format using the `pd.to_datetime` function. This should ensure that the `quantile` method for DataFrames behaves consistently with the equivalent method for Series, avoiding the reported ValueError.
