The error occurs when the `dispatch_to_series` function tries to perform the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing timedelta values. The error message specifically points to the `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'`.

The error occurs because the code doesn't handle the special case of the timedelta series properly and tries to perform the multiplication directly, leading to the unsupported operand error.

To fix the bug, the code should be updated to handle the special case of timedelta series when performing arithmetic operations.

Here's the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        if isinstance(right, (pd.Series, pd.DataFrame)):
            right = right.where(~right.isnull(), np.nan)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    # code for handling the other cases...

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected code, before performing the arithmetic operation, we handle the case of Series containing timedelta values by replacing the 'NaT' values with `np.nan`. This ensures that the operation can be performed without raising a `TypeError` due to unsupported operand types.
