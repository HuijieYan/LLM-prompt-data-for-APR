Potential error location: The `column_op` function is defined inside the `dispatch_to_series` function, but it is not being used or called within the `dispatch_to_series` function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `column_op` function is defined, but it is never used within the `dispatch_to_series` function. This makes the definition of `column_op` redundant and unnecessary.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Remove the definition of `column_op` function as it is not being used within the `dispatch_to_series` function.
2. If `column_op` is intended to be a separate function, then it should be defined outside of `dispatch_to_series` and called from within the `dispatch_to_series` function.

Fixed code for the problematic function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    #       with non-unique columns.

    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        assert right._indexed_same(left)
