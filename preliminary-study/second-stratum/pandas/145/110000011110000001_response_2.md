The error message is occurring in the `evaluate` function, specifically in the `_evaluate_standard` sub-function. The specific error message is "TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'". This indicates that there is an issue with trying to perform the multiplication operation between a NumPy array and a "NaT" (Not a Time) type object.

The bug is likely occurring within the `column_op` function defined in the `dispatch_to_series` function. When the operation is performed with the DataFrame `df` and the Series `ser` in the test function, the code is trying to perform element-wise multiplication between the elements of `df` and `ser`. However, it should not be trying to multiply "NaT" types with integers. This mismatch in types is causing the error.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to handle the case where one of the operands is "NaT" (Not a Time) type. One approach to fix this bug is to check for the presence of "NaT" in the Series and handle it differently when encountered. For example, if "NaT" is encountered in the Series, the operation should skip that element or substitute it with a default value like 0.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
