The bug in the given function seems to be caused by confusion between Column indexing and Row indexing. As per the function definition, this method is intended to work with column-by-column data, but the existing code seems to be mismatching this behavior, causing errors.

To fix this bug, it's important to ensure that the data access and operation are applied to the appropriate columns based on the function requirements. For the provided test case and the expected values:

 - The variable `a.iloc` should represent the column indexing of DataFrame 'left'.
 - The variable `b` should represent the Series 'right'.
 - The variable `b.iloc` should represent the column indexing of the Series 'right'.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = pd.core.indexing.check_bool(left, right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 1:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert np.array_equal(right.index, left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert np.array_equal(right.index, left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert np.array_equal(right.index, left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected code, the appropriate handling for scalar, DataFrame, and Series types has been added to ensure that the column-wise operations are performed correctly based on the related parameters such as 'axis'. Additionally, the usage of 'np.array_equal' ensures correct comparison between indices, and the indexing uses 'iloc' as needed.
