The error occurs because the function `dispatch_to_series` does not properly handle the case when the right operand is a scalar NaT (Not a Time) type. This causes a TypeError when attempting to perform arithmetic operations involving this type.

To fix the bug, we need to add a specific case to handle the scalar NaT type when performing arithmetic operations.

The corrected function `dispatch_to_series` is as follows:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    if np.isscalar(right) and pd.isnull(right):
        column_result = {i: right for i in range(len(left.columns))}
    else:
        right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
        
        if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        # ... (other cases as before) ...
        else:
            # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
            raise NotImplementedError(right)
        
        column_result = column_op(left, right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_result, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In this corrected function, we have added a specific case to handle scalar NaT values. Instead of performing operations involving NaT, it simply returns NaT for each column in the DataFrame. This should prevent the TypeError from occurring in the test case provided.
