The test case `test_td64_op_nat_casting` is trying to perform a multiplication operation between a DataFrame `df` and a Series `ser` containing "NaT" values. The expected result is a DataFrame with the same shape as `df`, where each element is the result of multiplying the corresponding element in `df` with the corresponding element in `ser`. However, the error message is indicating that the code encounters a TypeError due to unsupported operand types for multiplication.

The potential error location is within the `dispatch_to_series` function, specifically in the `column_op` nested functions, which handle different cases for performing the element-wise operation.

The error occurs because the code fails to handle the case where the `right` operand is a scalar or a Series containing "NaT" values. This error is likely due to the fact that the code does not have a specific case for handling the multiplication operation when one of the operands is "NaT".

To fix the bug, we need to add a specific case to handle the multiplication operation when the `right` operand is a scalar or a Series containing "NaT" values.

The corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function is as follows:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
from pandas.api.types import is_scalar

def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            if is_scalar(b) and pd.api.types.is_scalar(b) and pd.isna(b):
                return {i: b for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            else:
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```
