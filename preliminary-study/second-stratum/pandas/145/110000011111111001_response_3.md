The error occurs in the `dispatch_to_series` function, specifically in the `column_op` dictionary comprehension. It attempts to perform a multiplication operation between the DataFrame `a` and a column of the Series `b`. However, due to the presence of NaT (Not a Time) values in the Series `b`, it causes a TypeError when trying to perform the operation.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `column_op` function to handle the NaT values in the Series `b`. One approach is to use `np.where` to conditionally apply the arithmetic operation, replacing the NaT values with 0 before the operation is performed.

Here's the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    # ... existing code ...

    if isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            b = np.where(pd.isna(b), 0, b)  # Replace NaT with 0
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In this corrected code, the `column_op` function includes the line `b = np.where(pd.isna(b), 0, b)` to replace NaT values in the Series `b` with 0 before the arithmetic operation is performed between the DataFrame `a` and `b`. This modification handles the NaT values, avoiding the TypeError when performing the arithmetic operation.
