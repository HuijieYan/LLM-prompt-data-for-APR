The test case `test_td64_op_nat_casting` is attempting to perform a multiplication operation (`df * ser`) between a DataFrame and a Series with `dtype="timedelta64[ns]"`. The error message indicates that the multiplication operation is failing due to the unsupported operand type(s) for `*`: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'. This means that the multiplication operation is not handling the 'NaT' (Not a Time) type correctly.

The error is likely occurring in the `dispatch_to_series` function, specifically in the nested functions such as `column_op`.

The bug occurs because the function is not handling the 'NaT' type when performing the arithmetic operation.

To fix the bug:
1. We should handle 'NaT' type explicitly in the `column_op` function to ensure the arithmetic operation can handle the 'NaT' values correctly.
2. We may need to modify the column_op function to check for 'NaT' values and implement logic to handle them accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            if pd.api.types.is_scalar(b) and pd.isna(b):
                return {i: b for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            else:
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    # ... (other conditions remain the same)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In this corrected code, the `column_op` function now explicitly handles 'NaT' values when performing the arithmetic operation. If the right operand is a scalar and is 'NaT', it returns an empty dictionary for that column. Otherwise, it performs the arithmetic operation as before.
