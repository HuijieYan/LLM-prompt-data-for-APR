Potential error location: The column_op function is defined multiple times with different conditions, but they are not being used within the dispatch_to_series function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The dispatch_to_series function is not utilizing the inner column_op functions, which are defined based on different conditions.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Remove the redundant definitions of the column_op function and define it only once with conditions handled inside the dispatch_to_series function.
2. Modify the dispatch_to_series function to appropriately use the column_op function based on the conditions.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
    
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index) 
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
