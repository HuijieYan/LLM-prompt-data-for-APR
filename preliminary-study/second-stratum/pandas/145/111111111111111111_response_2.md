The `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'` error occurs at line 92 in pandas/core/ops/array_ops.py. This error is caused by the multiplication operation between an ndarray and NaTType within the `masked_arith_op` function.

The bug is occurring due to the `dispatch_to_series` function's failure to handle the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing NaT values. The algorithm does not correctly handle the NaTType when performing element-wise multiplication.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `dispatch_to_series` function. Specifically, in the `column_op` function, we should handle the case where the right operand contains NaT values. We should modify the multiplication operation to handle this case explicitly by checking for NaT and then using a conditional return value for the multiplication result in the `column_op` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not pd.isna(b) else b for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) if not b.isna().any() else b for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if not pd.isna(b.iloc[i]) else b.iloc[i] for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not pd.isna(b) else b for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

The changes include explicitly handling the case where the right operand contains NaT values in each conditional block within the `dispatch_to_series` function. Also, the usage of `pd.isna` is preferred over `np.isnan` due to better support for pandas-specific operations.
