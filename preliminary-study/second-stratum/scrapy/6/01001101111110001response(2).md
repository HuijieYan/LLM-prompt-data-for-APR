Potential error location: The error might be occurring in the section of the code where the image format and mode are being checked and converted.

Reasons behind the bug:
1. The code is not properly handling transparency when the image format is PNG and mode is RGBA.
2. The code is not handling transparency case with palette properly when the image format is PNG and mode is P.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check for transparency when the image format is PNG and mode is RGBA, and handle it appropriately by converting the alpha channel to white.
2. Handle the transparency case with palette properly by converting the image to RGB.

Corrected code:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageOps
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Convert the alpha channel to white to remove transparency
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode == 'P':
        # Convert the image to RGB to remove transparency when mode is P
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```
