The error message indicates that the colors of the converted image are not as expected.

Upon analyzing the function, it seems that the issue lies in the conditional checks for the image format and mode. Specifically, the condition `image.format == 'PNG'` should be checked using lowercase as image formats are usually represented in lowercase.

The original function also incorrectly pastes the image onto the background when creating a new RGBA image with a white background. This should be corrected to `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)`. Additionally, after pasting the image onto the background, there is no need to convert the image to RGB again.

Lastly, the JPEG quality should be specified when saving the image.

### Correction to the function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format.lower() == 'png' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, format='JPEG', quality=90)
    return image, buf
```
