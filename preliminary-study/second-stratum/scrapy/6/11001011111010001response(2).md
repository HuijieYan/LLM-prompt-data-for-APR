The error message from the test function indicates that the color values of the images are not as expected. This suggests that the conversion process inside the `convert_image` function is not working correctly.

The potential error location within the `convert_image` function is the conversion logic for PNG images with RGBA mode. It seems that the conversion logic for handling transparency is not functioning as expected.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the conditional check for PNG images with RGBA mode may not be correctly handling the transparency channel during conversion.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic to correctly handle the transparency channel for PNG images with RGBA mode.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and 'A' in image.getbands():
        new_image = Image.new("RGB", image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        new_image.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = new_image
    image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, format='JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected code:
- We check for the presence of the alpha channel ('A' in image.getbands()) for PNG images, instead of directly checking the mode.
- We create a new RGB image with a white background and paste the original image onto it to handle transparency.
- We convert the image to RGB mode to remove any transparency information.

These changes should address the bug and ensure that the conversion logic handles PNG images with RGBA mode correctly.
