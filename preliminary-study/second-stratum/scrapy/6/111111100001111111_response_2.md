The buggy function is the `convert_image` method. The issue lies in the if condition for checking if the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'. In this conditional block, the code is creating a new background image and then pasting the original image onto it, but it is using the `paste` method incorrectly. The `paste` method takes a tuple as the second argument, which represents the upper left corner of the pasted image. Additionally, the image is not being pasted into the background correctly.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the way the images are pasted onto the background and also change the background image's mode to RGB. If an image is not in RGB mode, it should be converted to RGB before the thumbnail is created and saved.

Below is the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```
