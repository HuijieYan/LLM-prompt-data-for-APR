The potential error in the provided code is that when the input image has an RGBA mode, the function tries to create a new RGBA background and paste the image onto it, and then converts the image to RGB. This might cause the alpha channel to be lost when converting from RGBA to RGB. Additionally, the function saves the image as a JPEG without handling the alpha channel properly, which can cause loss of transparency.

To fix this bug, you can modify the code to handle the alpha channel correctly when converting from RGBA to RGB. You can also add a check to save the image as PNG if the original image format is PNG.

Below is the corrected code:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))  # Create a new RGBA background with alpha channel
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)  # Paste the original image onto the background
        image = background  # Assign the pasted image to the variable
    elif image.mode != 'RGB' and image.mode != 'RGBA':  # If the image mode is not RGB or RGBA
        image = image.convert('RGB')  # Convert the image to RGB

    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    if image.format == 'PNG':  # Save the image as PNG if the original format is PNG
        image.save(buf, 'PNG', optimize=True)
    else:
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')  # Otherwise, save the image as JPEG
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected code, we ensure that the alpha channel is preserved when pasting the image onto the background and handle the transparency properly. We also added a check to save the image as PNG if the original format is PNG.
