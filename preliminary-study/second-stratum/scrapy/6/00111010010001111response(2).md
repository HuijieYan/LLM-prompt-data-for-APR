The test case is failing due to incorrect color values returned by the buggy function `convert_image` for the RGBA and PNG image. The buggy function is not handling the RGBA and PNG images correctly, which is causing the test case to fail.

The bug occurs because the function is not correctly handling the conversion of image formats and modes, especially for RGBA and PNG images. Additionally, the function is not handling the transparency correctly while converting the image to RGB format.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle RGBA and PNG images by preserving the transparency values and converting them to the RGB format without losing the alpha channel information.

Here's the corrected function for `convert_image`:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode in ("RGBA", "LA") or (image.mode == "P" and "transparency" in image.info):
        image = image.convert("RGBA")
        background = Image.new("RGBA", image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert("RGB")
    elif image.mode != "RGB":
        image = image.convert("RGB")

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, resample=Image.LANCZOS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, "JPEG")
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected function, we are checking for RGBA, LA, and P with transparency to preserve the alpha channel information. We are then pasting the image onto a white background to preserve the transparency and converting it to RGB. Finally, we are saving the image as a JPEG and returning the modified image and buffer.
