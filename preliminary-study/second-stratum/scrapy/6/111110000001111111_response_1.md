The issue with the provided code is that the 'convert_image' method is not handling the PNG images with RGBA mode correctly. It tries to convert all PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB mode, which may lead to the loss of transparency. Additionally, the function is trying to save the image in JPEG format regardless of its original format.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the 'convert_image' method to handle PNG images with RGBA mode differently and also save the image in its original format.

Here's the corrected code for the 'convert_image' method:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            buf = BytesIO()
            image.save(buf, format='PNG')
            return image, buf
        else:
            if image.mode != 'RGB':
                image = image.convert('RGB')
            
            if size:
                image = image.copy()
                image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
            buf = BytesIO()
            image.save(buf, format=image.format)
            return image, buf
```

In the updated code, we check if the image is in PNG format and has RGBA mode. If so, we directly save the image with its original format and return the image and the buffer. For other images, we continue with the previous logic of converting to RGB mode if necessary, resizing, and then saving the image in its original format.

This fix ensures that PNG images with RGBA mode are handled correctly and that images are saved in their original format.
