Potential Error Location: 
The potential error in the `convert_image` method lies in the conditional statements that check the image format and mode. 

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the conditional statement for checking the format and mode of the image does not cover all possible scenarios. It only checks for PNG format and RGBA mode, and assumes all other images are in RGB mode. This assumption can lead to erroneous conversions, especially for images with different formats and modes.

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional statements to handle different image formats and modes appropriately. Additionally, we should ensure that the image conversion process preserves the original image characteristics.

Corrected Code:
```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    else:
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```
