The potential error location within the problematic function is the condition where it checks if the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA'. The bug occurs because the conditional check is case-sensitive, but the format and mode might be in uppercase.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not handling the case sensitivity of image format and mode, and it is not converting the format to uppercase before checking.

To fix the bug, we need to convert the image format and mode to uppercase before checking them in the condition.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format.upper() == 'PNG' and image.mode.upper() == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode.upper() != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this correction, the function will handle the case sensitivity of image format and mode, and it should work properly for the provided test cases.
