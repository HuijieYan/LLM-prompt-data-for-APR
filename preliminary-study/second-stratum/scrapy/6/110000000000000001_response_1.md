Potential bug location: 
The bug may be occurring when trying to paste the image onto the white background in the RGBA conversion section and in the image.save() method where the file format is specified as JPEG.

Reason for the bug:
1. In the RGBA conversion section, the paste() method is used incorrectly, as it should take the image itself as the first argument and not as part of the tuple.
2. In the image.save() method, the file format is set to JPEG regardless of whether the original image is in PNG format.

Approach to fix the bug:
1. In the RGBA conversion section, the paste() method should be used correctly by passing the image itself as the first argument.
2. In the image.save() method, the file format should be determined based on the original image format to maintain the same format in the output.

Corrected code:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageOps
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    if image.format:
        format = image.format
    else:
        format = 'JPEG'
    image.save(buf, format)
    return image, buf
```
