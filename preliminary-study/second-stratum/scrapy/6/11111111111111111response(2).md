The issue in the `convert_image` function seems to be related to the conversion of image modes and colors. The error message from the test function indicates that the expected colors of the images are not matching the actual colors.

The issue could be in the conditional statements that reassign the `image` variable. It seems like the condition for checking the image format and mode is incorrect, leading to the wrong conversion and affecting the image colors. Additionally, the logic for thumbnail generation might need to be revisited to ensure that the image ratio is maintained.

To fix the bug:
1. Update the condition for checking the image format and mode to correctly identify cases where conversion is necessary.
2. Adjust the logic for maintaining the image ratio during thumbnail generation.
3. Ensure that the color channels are preserved during the conversions.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode not in ('L', 'RGB'):
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.LANCZOS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)

    return image, buf
```
