The bug in the convert_image function lies in the conditional check for image.format and image.mode. In the current implementation, if the format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA', the function creates a new image with a white background and then converts it to RGB. However, this logic is incorrect as it always converts the image to RGB, regardless of the initial format and mode.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional check to only convert the image to RGB if the format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA'. Additionally, we need to handle the case where the image mode is not 'RGB'. Then we need to copy the image and thumbnail it if a size is provided. Finally, we save the image to a BytesIO buffer and return it.

Here's the corrected code for the convert_image function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        thumbnail = image.copy()
        thumbnail.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        image = thumbnail

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In this corrected code, we create a new image with a white background and paste the original image onto it if the format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA'. Then we convert the image to RGB when the mode is not 'RGB'. If a size is provided, we create a thumbnail of the image. Finally, we save the image to a BytesIO buffer and return both the image and the buffer.
