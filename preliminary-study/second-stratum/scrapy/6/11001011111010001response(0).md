The error message from the test function indicates that the color values are not as expected after converting the image. This suggests that there may be an issue with the image conversion process in the `convert_image` function.

Upon reviewing the `convert_image` function, it appears that there are issues with the conditional statements for handling different image modes and formats. The bug is likely occurring in the conditional block for converting PNG images with RGBA mode.

The conditional block for PNG images with RGBA mode is incorrect because it is creating a new background image and attempting to paste the original image onto it. However, the correct approach should be to use the `alpha_composite` method to create a new RGBA image with a white background and then convert it to RGB.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the conditional block for PNG images with RGBA mode to use the `alpha_composite` method and then convert the image to RGB.

Here's the corrected `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageOps
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        image = Image.alpha_composite(background, image).convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With these corrections, the function should be able to properly handle the conversion of images with different modes and formats. This should resolve the issue encountered in the test function.
