The buggy function `convert_image` is supposed to take an image and an optional size as input, and then process the image by converting it to RGB format, resizing it if a size is provided, and saving it as a JPEG image. However, there are several issues with the current implementation:

1. The first if condition checks for `image.format == 'PNG'` and `image.mode == 'RGBA'`, but later it tries to handle the image with mode `P`. This inconsistency can lead to unexpected behavior.

2. The function does not handle the case when the input image mode is not 'RGB' or 'RGBA' properly.

3. The function should return the `buf` variable at the end, but it currently returns both the image and `buf`.

To fix these issues, the following corrections can be made:

1. Ensure that the function accepts images with different modes, instead of specifically checking for 'PNG' and 'RGBA'.

2. Handle the case when the input image is not in the desired mode. If the image is not in 'RGB' mode, convert it to 'RGB'.

3. Only return the `buf` variable at the end of the function.

The corrected function `convert_image` is provided below:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode not in ['RGB', 'RGBA']:
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return buf  # only return the buf variable
```
