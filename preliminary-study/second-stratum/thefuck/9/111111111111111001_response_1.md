The error occurs when the function tries to remove an element at a specific index from the list `command.script_parts` using the `pop` method. In the cases where the `upstream_option_index` is found in the list, it should be removed only once. However, in the current implementation, the `pop` method is called twice, which causes an `IndexError` when the index is out of range after the first element is removed.

The buggy function `get_new_command` is trying to find and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option from the `command.script_parts` list, along with its argument. The code then uses the remaining arguments in `command.script_parts` to construct the new command.

The bug occurs because when the `upstream_option_index` is found and the corresponding element is removed using `pop`, the list becomes shorter, and the original index for the next element to remove has shifted. However, the code still tries to remove an element at the same index again, leading to the `IndexError`.

To fix the bug, the function should check for the existence of the element before removing it, and if it exists, remove it only once. Additionally, the function should handle both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options separately.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove them and their arguments
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove --set-upstream
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove its argument
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove -u
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove its argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected code checks for the existence of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options before removing them from the list, and it ensures that each option and its argument are removed only once.
