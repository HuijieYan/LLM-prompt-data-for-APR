The potential error location within the problematic function is at the `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` line.

The error is caused by the pop operation being called twice for the same index in the list `command.script_parts`, which causes an "IndexError: pop index out of range" in cases where the index was already removed in the first pop operation.

To fix the bug, you can change the conditional statements in the function to handle both cases of `--set-upstream` and `-u` separately and remove the index only once for each case.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
