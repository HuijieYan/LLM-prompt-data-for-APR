The bug is occurring in the `get_new_command` function. The function is trying to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option from the `command.script_parts` list, but it is not handling the removal of '-u' correctly. When the function finds the index of '-u', it is not removing the argument that comes after '-u'.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic for removing the '-u' and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index + 1)  # Remove the argument after -u
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    elif '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index + 1)  # Remove the argument after --set-upstream
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected code checks for both '-u' and '--set-upstream' in the `command.script_parts` list, and if found, it removes the option and its argument correctly. This should fix the issue with the incorrect suggestion for git push -u.
