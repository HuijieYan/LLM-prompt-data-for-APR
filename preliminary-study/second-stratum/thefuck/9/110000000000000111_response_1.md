Potential Error Location:
The error is likely occurring in the section that tries to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options from the command, as well as in the section that extracts the push destination from the stderr.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug likely occurred due to the incorrect manipulation of the command's script parts and the incorrect extraction of the push destination from the stderr.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options are present in the command before attempting to remove them.
2. Ensure that the extraction of the push destination from the stderr is done accurately.

Corrected Code:

```python
# corrected function
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
