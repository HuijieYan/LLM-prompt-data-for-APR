## Analyzing the bug
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify the command for `git push` based on the output of the command. However, it is not handling the `-u` or `--set-upstream` options correctly and is also not parsing the push upstream branch correctly, which leads to incorrect suggestions for the user.

## Error location
The error is occurring in the handling of the `-u` and `--set-upstream` options, as well as in parsing the push upstream branch from the command. 

## Reasons behind the bug
1. The function incorrectly handles the `-u` and `--set-upstream` options, leading to incorrect removal from the `command.script_parts`.
2. The function incorrectly parses the push upstream branch from the command, leading to suggestions that do not accurately represent what the user should input.

## Possible approaches for fixing the bug
1. Use proper condition checks and index manipulation to handle the `-u` and `--set-upstream` options correctly.
2. Extract the push upstream branch using proper parsing techniques from the output of the command.

## Corrected code
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index) # Remove --set-upstream
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index) # Remove its argument
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index) # Remove -u
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index) # Remove its argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].split()[-1] # Parse the push upstream branch correctly
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
