Potential error location: The buggy function aims to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument from the command script parts list. Then, it uses the stderr output to extract the suggested command by Git, and replaces the 'push' command within the script parts with the suggested command.

Reasons behind the bug:
1. The code is using the 'stderr' to extract the suggested command instead of the 'stdout' which contains the expected suggested command.
2. The logic to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument from the command script parts list is incorrect.

Possible approaches:
1. Use the 'stdout' instead of 'stderr' to extract the suggested command by Git.
2. Instead of trying to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options based on their indices in the script_parts list, use a more robust approach to remove them if present.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    command_parts = command.script.split()
    if '--set-upstream' in command_parts:
        index = command_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command_parts.pop(index)
        command_parts.pop(index)
    elif '-u' in command_parts:
        index = command_parts.index('-u')
        command_parts.pop(index)
        command_parts.pop(index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stdout.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_command(" ".join(command_parts), 'git push', push_upstream)
```
