The error message "IndexError: pop index out of range" indicates that the pop() function is trying to remove an element from a list at an index that does not exist. This suggests that the index computed for upstream_option_index is incorrect or the corresponding elements do not exist in the list.

The buggy function is trying to remove elements from command.script_parts based on indices computed from "--set-upstream" and "-u", which may not be present in the list. Additionally, the logic for populating push_upstream from the stderr seems to be problematic.

To fix this, we can modify the code to safely remove the elements from command.script_parts and handle the extraction of push_upstream from the stderr more carefully.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
# corrected function
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    for line in command.stderr.split('\n'):
        if 'git push' in line:
            push_upstream = line.strip().partition('git ')[2]
            break
    else:
        push_upstream = 'origin master'

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In the corrected code, we first check if '--set-upstream' or '-u' exists in command.script_parts before trying to remove them. We then iterate through the lines of stderr to find the line containing 'git push' and extract the push_upstream information. If no such line is found, we default push_upstream to 'origin master'.

With these changes, the function should now handle the input cases and tests as expected without raising any IndexError.
