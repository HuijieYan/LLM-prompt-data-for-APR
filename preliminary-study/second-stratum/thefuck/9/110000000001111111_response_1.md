The buggy function is designed to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument from the command and replace 'push' with the suggestion obtained from the command's stderr. However, the current implementation is incorrect.

The issue is that the function is using the `command.script_parts` to find the index of '--set-upstream' or '-u', and then attempting to remove these elements from the list. However, it is not correctly handling the case when these options are present. Also, the method `replace_argument` is not defined in the code provided.

To fix the bug, the function needs to accurately identify and remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list, and then use the corrected command for accessing the suggestion from stderr.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    try:
        upstream_option_index = script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument as well
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = script_parts.index('-u')
            script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument as well
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return " ".join(script_parts) + ' ' + push_upstream
```

In the corrected code, we split the `command.script` to obtain the list of parts. Then, we remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' and its argument if they are present. Finally, we concatenate the modified script parts with the obtained push suggestion from stderr to form the new command.
