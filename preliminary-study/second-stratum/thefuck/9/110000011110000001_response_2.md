Potential error location: The error seems to occur in the 'get_new_command' function, specifically in the part where it tries to pop elements from the 'command.script_parts' list.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug occurs because the index 'upstream_option_index' is being used without checking if it is in range. So, when the index is not found in the list, it still tries to pop the element at that index, causing the 'IndexError'.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if 'upstream_option_index' is not equal to -1 before attempting to pop the element.
2. Also, handle the case when both '--set-upstream' and '-u' are present in the list.

Corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_options = ['--set-upstream', '-u']
    for option in upstream_options:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument as well
            break  # Exit the loop if option is found
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
