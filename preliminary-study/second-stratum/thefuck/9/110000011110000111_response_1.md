The error message indicates that an IndexError occurred while trying to pop an element from the command.script_parts list. This suggests that the index being used to pop the elements is out of range.

Upon analyzing the code, the potential error location is identified within the if condition checking if upstream_option_index is not -1. Inside this condition, the pop operation is being performed on upstream_option_index twice, which could lead to the index going out of bounds.

The bug occurs because the pop operation on upstream_option_index is being performed twice without checking if it is still a valid index after the first pop operation. This can lead to the index going out of range if the list becomes smaller after the first pop operation.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the index is still within the valid range after the first pop operation before performing the second pop operation. Additionally, the logic to check for the presence of '--set-upstream' or '-u' should be modified to extract the index only if it exists.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected code ensures that the index is only popped if it exists and also checks the presence of '--set-upstream' or '-u' separately.
