The buggy function get_new_command has multiple issues. It seems like the function is trying to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument from the command and then replace 'push' with the new suggestion derived from the command's stderr.

The issues with the function are:
1. The logic to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument from the command is not correct. It is using pop method to remove elements from the list, but it should only remove the option and its argument, not both occurrences of it.
2. The code assumes that the push suggestion can be extracted from the command's stderr by splitting it and getting the second last line, which may not be reliable if the error message format changes.

To fix the issue, the function should be modified to:
- Find the index of '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument, and remove them correctly from the list of script_parts.
- Extract the push suggestion from the error message in a more reliable way, for example by using regular expressions.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        del command.script_parts[index:index+2]
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        del command.script_parts[index:index+2]

    # Extract push suggestion from stderr using regular expression
    match = re.search(r'git push (.+)$', command.stderr, re.MULTILINE)
    if match:
        push_suggestion = match.group(1)
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_suggestion)
    else:
        return " ".join(command.script_parts)
```

This corrected function uses the correct approach to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument from the script_parts list, and extracts the push suggestion from the error message using a regular expression for better reliability.
