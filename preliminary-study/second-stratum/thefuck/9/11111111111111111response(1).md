The error is occurring in the `get_new_command` function when the script parts are popped. The error message indicates that the pop index is out of range, which means that the index being used to pop the elements from the list is exceeding the bounds of the list.

This is likely happening because the `upstream_option_index` is not being updated correctly. In particular, when `-u` is not found in `command.script_parts`, the index is not correctly updated.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to correctly update the `upstream_option_index` for both `--set-upstream` and `-u`. Additionally, we should also check if the index is not equal to -1 before attempting to pop the elements from the `command.script_parts`.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected code should address the issues identified in the original buggy function.
