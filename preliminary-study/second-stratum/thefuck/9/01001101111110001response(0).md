The error message "IndexError: pop index out of range" implies that the `pop` method is being called on an index that is out of range, meaning it does not exist in the list. This is likely happening in the following lines of code:
```python
command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
```
The reason behind this bug is that when the `upstream_option_index` is found, it is being used twice to call the `pop` method. This causes an issue because after the first call to `pop`, the list becomes shorter and the index stored in `upstream_option_index` is no longer valid.

To fix this bug, the code should be updated to remove the correct index from the list only once.

```python
# Corrected function
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
In the corrected code, I have removed the second call to `pop` and also updated the condition `if upstream_option_index is not -1` to `if upstream_option_index != -1` for clarity. This should solve the issue of the index being out of range.
