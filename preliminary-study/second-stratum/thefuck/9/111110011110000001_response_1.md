The error message indicates an "IndexError" at line 27, which corresponds to the line `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` in the `get_new_command` function. The error occurs because the `upstream_option_index` is being used to remove elements from the `command.script_parts` list even when it might not have been found using `index()`.

The bug occurs because the code does not handle the scenario where the '--set-upstream' or '-u' flag is not found in the `command.script_parts` list. This leads to the `upstream_option_index` variable being set to -1, and then attempting to use this invalid index to remove elements from the list.

To fix this bug, we should check if `upstream_option_index` is not -1 before attempting to remove elements from the list.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove the corresponding argument as well

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
