The error message indicates an "IndexError" occurring at the line `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` within the `get_new_command` function. This suggests that the `upstream_option_index` is out of range, leading to an attempt to pop an index that does not exist in the list.

The reason for this bug is that the code checks for the presence of '--set-upstream' or '-u' using two separate try-except blocks, and then it tries to remove both indices - even if only one is present. This leads to potential index out of range issues.

To fix the bug, a single try-except block can be used to check for both '--set-upstream' and '-u' options, and then if either is found, the relevant index can be stored and used to remove the options from the `command.script_parts` list.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git,
    # which includes --set-upstream and its argument

    # Check for both '--set-upstream' and '-u' and store the index if found
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    # Remove the option and its argument if found
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # check if index is not out of range and then remove the corresponding argument
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    # The remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By using this corrected code, the issue with the index out of range error will be resolved, ensuring that the function works as intended.
