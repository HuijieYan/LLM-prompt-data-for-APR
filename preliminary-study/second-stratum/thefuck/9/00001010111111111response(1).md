The error occurs at the line `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` in the buggy function. This is causing an `IndexError: pop index out of range` because the `upstream_option_index` is set to -1 by default, and it's not being checked if it's valid before performing the pop operation.

The bug occurs because the code doesn't handle the case where the `upstream_option_index` is not found correctly. When `-u` or `--set-upstream` is not present in the `command.script_parts`, the index returns -1, and then the code tries to perform a pop operation on that index, resulting in an IndexError.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the `upstream_option_index` is valid before running the `pop` operation. If it's not valid, we should not perform the `pop` operation.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    else:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1
        if upstream_option_index != -1:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, we handle the scenario where `-u` or `--set-upstream` is not found in the `command.script_parts`, preventing the IndexError from occurring.
