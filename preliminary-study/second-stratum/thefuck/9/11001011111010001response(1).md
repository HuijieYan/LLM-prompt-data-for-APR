The error message "IndexError: pop index out of range" suggests that there is an issue with popping elements from the `command.script_parts` list. The buggy function is trying to pop elements based on the `upstream_option_index` value, but it seems that the index is not being calculated or updated correctly. This is causing the index to be out of range when trying to pop elements.

The buggy function is attempting to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options and their arguments from the `command.script_parts` list. However, the logic for finding the index of these options and removing them is not implemented correctly. This is resulting in an out of range index when trying to pop elements.

To fix this bug, a more robust approach for identifying and removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options and their arguments should be implemented. Additionally, error handling should be added to ensure that the index exists before trying to pop elements from the list.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # pop the argument too
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # pop the argument too
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected function, it should handle the removal of '--set-upstream' or '-u' options and their arguments properly, without causing an index out of range error.
