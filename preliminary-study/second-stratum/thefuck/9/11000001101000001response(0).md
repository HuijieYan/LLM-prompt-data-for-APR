The potential error location within the problematic function is in the try-except blocks that are used to find the index of '--set-upstream' or '-u' in the command.script_parts list. If neither of these options is found, the upstream_option_index variable will still have the initial value of -1, causing the subsequent if statement to evaluate to True when it should not.

The bug occurs because the code tries to find the index of both '--set-upstream' and '-u' in the command.script_parts list, but if one of them is found, it does not prevent the other from being found as well. This leads to the incorrect removal of the '--set-upstream' and '-u' options from the script_parts list, and subsequently leads to an error when the code tries to access the push destination from the stderr.

To fix the bug, a better approach would be to use an if-else structure so that if one option is found, the other is not searched for. Additionally, error handling should be included to handle cases when the push destination is not present in the stderr.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        if len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index + 1:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    if len(stderr_lines) >= 3:
        push_upstream = stderr_lines[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)

    return " ".join(command.script_parts)
```
