Potential error location: 
The error is likely to be in the try-except blocks where the code is attempting to find the index of '--set-upstream' and '-u' in the `command.script_parts`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. The `try-except` blocks are not handled in the correct way as the code attempts to find the index of both '--set-upstream' and '-u', but the second check overwrites the index found by the first check.
2. If the index is not found, the `except` block simply passes, which means the value of `upstream_option_index` is always -1.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use if-else statements instead of multiple try-except blocks to correctly cater to both options.
2. Check if the index obtained from the first try block is -1, then only execute the second try block.
3. Additionally, handle the scenario where neither '--set-upstream' nor '-u' is present in the `command.script_parts`.

Corrected code:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    else:
        if '-u' in command.script_parts:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
