The issue seems to be related to the handling of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options in the `git push` command. The function `get_new_command` is supposed to modify the command string by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument, and then replacing the argument 'push' with a computed value.

The potential error location is in the handling of the `upstream_option_index` and the subsequent removal of the option and its argument from the `command.script_parts`.

The bug is likely occurring because the function incorrectly tries to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument by using `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` twice. This will result in removing only the option, not its argument.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to find the index of the `-u` option if it exists and remove both the option and its argument together from `command.script_parts`. Additionally, it may be necessary to check if the list of `command.script_parts` is not empty before trying to access its elements via indexing.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        del command.script_parts[upstream_option_index: upstream_option_index + 2]
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        del command.script_parts[upstream_option_index: upstream_option_index + 2]

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In this corrected code, we use the `del` statement to remove the `-u` or `--set-upstream` option and its argument from `command.script_parts` if they exist. This will properly remove both the option and its argument from the list of script parts.
