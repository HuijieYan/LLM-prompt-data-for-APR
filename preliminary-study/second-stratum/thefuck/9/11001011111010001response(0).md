The error "IndexError: pop index out of range" indicates that the `pop` method is being called on an index that doesn't exist, which means the index is out of range.

Looking at the test cases, it seems that the buggy function is trying to modify the `command.script_parts` list by popping elements based on index values calculated from the presence of "--set-upstream" or "-u". 

The bug occurs because when the first 'try' block finds the index of '--set-upstream', it modifies the list and then the second 'try' block tries to find the index of '-u' in the modified list, which may not exist and causes the error.

To address this issue, we can combine both 'try' blocks and update the index only if it is found. Also, the condition `upstream_option_index is not -1` should be updated to `upstream_option_index != -1`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        index_u = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        upstream_option_index = index_u
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This updated code should address the issue of the index being out of range by properly handling the modification of options in the `command.script_parts` list.
