The error message from the test function indicates that the expected output is 'Fish Shell 3.5.9', but the actual output is 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'. This suggests that the `info` method is not correctly extracting the version number from the command output.

The potential error location within the `info` method is the line where the version is being extracted from the command output.

The bug occurred because the command being used in the `info` method is 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION', which results in the output 'fish, version 3.5.9' instead of just the version number.

To fix the bug, the command being used in the `info` method should be changed to just 'fish --version' to get the version number from the command output.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` method:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.replace('fish, version ', ''))
```

With this correction, the `info` method will correctly extract the version number from the command output and return 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'.
