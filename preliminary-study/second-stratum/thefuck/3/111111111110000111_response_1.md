1. The test case is comparing the output of the shell.info() function with the expected value 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'. It also checks the arguments passed to the Popen function.
2. The potential error location is in the info() function where the version string is not correctly extracted from the output of the Popen command.
3. The bug is occurring because the Popen call is using 'fish -c' to execute the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION', but the test case is expecting the version output to be in the format 'fish, version 3.5.9'.
4. To fix the bug, we need to use the correct command to get the fish shell version and also format the version output to match the expected value in the test case.
5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE

class Fish(Generic):
    
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(' ')[2]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected code, we are using 'fish --version' to get the fish shell version, and then extracting the version number from the output using split(' ')[2]. This should fix the bug and make the test case pass.
