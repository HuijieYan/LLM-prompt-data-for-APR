Potential error location: The bug seems to be in the Popen function, as it is not being called correctly.

Reasons for the bug: The Popen function is being called with the wrong arguments, missing the shell=True argument, which is required to run a command through the shell.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: We need to add the shell=True argument to the Popen function to run the 'fish -c' command through the shell.

Corrected code:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], shell=True,
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
