The error in the code seems to be in the info method of the Fish class. The method is attempting to retrieve the Fish shell version using the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' but instead, it should be retrieving the version using the '--version' flag.

The reason for the bug is that the method is not properly fetching the version from the shell, leading to an incorrect result.

To fix the bug, the method should be modified to use the '--version' flag to retrieve the version of the Fish shell.

Here is the corrected code for the info method:

```python
def info(self):
    """
    Returns the name and version of the current shell
    """
    
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using the '--version' flag with the 'fish' command, the method will correctly fetch the version of the Fish shell, and the test case should pass without any issues.
