The error seems to be occurring in the `info` method of the `Fish` class. The method is trying to retrieve the Fish shell version by running a subprocess and capturing the output. However, the method is not handling the case where the subprocess fails or returns an unexpected output, leading to a crash or incorrect output.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to add error handling for the subprocess call and also validate the output to ensure it matches the expected format (e.g., "fish, version x.x.x").

Here's the corrected code for the `info` method:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL


class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        try:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                         stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
            if version.startswith("fish, version "):
                return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version[len("fish, version "):])
            else:
                return 'Fish Shell version not found'
        except Exception as e:
            return 'Error retrieving Fish Shell version'
```
