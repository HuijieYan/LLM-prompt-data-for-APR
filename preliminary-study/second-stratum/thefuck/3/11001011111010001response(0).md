Potential error location:
The issue seems to be with the command that is being passed to Popen. The command should be 'fish --version' instead of 'echo $FISH_VERSION'.

Reason behind the bug:
The existing code is trying to retrieve the version of the fish shell by using the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION', which is not the correct way to get the version. This is causing the test to fail, as the expected version is not being retrieved.

Approach for fixing the bug:
Modify the command passed to Popen to 'fish --version' in order to retrieve the correct version of the fish shell.

Corrected code:
```python
# file name: /Users/jerry/.abw/BugsInPy_Dir/BugsInPy_Cloned_Repos/thefuck/thefuck/shells/fish.py

# corrected function
def info(self):
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
