Potential error location: The potential error in the code is with the usage of Popen and PIPE without importing the necessary modules.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The code is using Popen and PIPE without importing the subprocess module which causes the NameError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Import the subprocess module at the beginning of the file to use Popen and PIPE.

Corrected code:

```python
import subprocess

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = subprocess.Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
In the corrected code, the subprocess module is imported, and the Popen and PIPE are used with the module prefix "subprocess." to resolve the NameError and use the Popen and PIPE functionality.
