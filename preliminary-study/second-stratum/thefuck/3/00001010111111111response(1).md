The bug in this function is caused by using the incorrect command to retrieve the Fish shell version. The function is currently using 'echo $FISH_VERSION' which is not the correct command to get the Fish shell version. This is causing the test to fail and the function to return an unexpected result.

To fix this bug, the function should use the correct command to get the Fish shell version, which is 'fish --version'. This command will return the version number of the Fish shell, which can then be parsed to retrieve the version for the function output.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(', ')[1])
```

By using the correct command to get the Fish shell version, the function should now return the expected output and pass the test case.
