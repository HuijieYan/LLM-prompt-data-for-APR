Potential error location: The problem seems to be in the `info` function of the Fish class. The function is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell using the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`, but the test case is expecting a different output format.

Reason for the bug: The `info` function is not returning the expected format of the shell version.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the command in the `info` function to retrieve the version in the expected format.
2. Modify the function to format the retrieved version in the expected output format.

Corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
from subprocess import PIPE, Popen, DEVNULL

class Fish(Generic):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return 'Fish Shell ' + version.split(',')[1].strip()
```
