Potential error location: The function attempts to get the version of the Fish shell by running a subprocess, but it doesn't handle the subprocess communication properly.

Reasons for the bug:
1. The Popen subprocess is not being properly communicated with.
2. The function does not handle any potential errors that may occur during the subprocess execution.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use communicate() method to properly communicate with the subprocess and capture its output.
2. Add error handling to deal with any potential issues that may arise during the subprocess execution.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_3/thefuck/shells/fish.py

# corrected function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE)  # communicate with subprocess
    stdout, stderr = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()  # capture output
    if version:
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    else:
        return "Unable to determine Fish shell version"
```
