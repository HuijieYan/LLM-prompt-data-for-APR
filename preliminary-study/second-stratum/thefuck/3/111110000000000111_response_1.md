Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the `info` function in the `Fish` class, specifically with the Popen call that hangs when trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the Popen call is not correctly handling the output from the `fish` command, leading to a hang.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, we can use the `subprocess` module to run the `fish` command and capture its output. We can also use `check_output` to simplify the code and handle the output in a more reliable manner.

Corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            version = check_output(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']).decode('utf-8').strip()
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        except:
            return "Unable to retrieve Fish shell version"
```
