The bug in the given code is located in the `info` function. The Popen call specifies `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` as the command to run, but the expected output in the test function is from `['fish', '--version']`. There's also a mismatch between the command being executed and the expected version output.

The reason for the bug is that the Popen call is using the wrong command to retrieve the Fish shell version.

To fix the bug, the Popen call should be modified to use the correct command `['fish', '--version']` to retrieve the version of the Fish shell.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.replace('fish, version ', ''))
```
