The error is occurring because the function is trying to extract the version number from the output of the 'fish' shell, but it's not correctly parsing the output.

To fix this bug, we need to update the Popen call to use `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`. This will ensure that we are capturing the correct version information from the shell.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """
    Returns the name and version of the current shell
    """
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```
