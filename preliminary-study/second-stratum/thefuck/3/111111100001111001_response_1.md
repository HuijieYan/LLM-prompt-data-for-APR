Potential error location: The function is not properly handling the output from the Popen command.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug is likely due to the incorrect handling of the Popen command's output. It seems that the function is not reading the output of the Popen command correctly and is not constructing the version string appropriately.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Using the `communicate()` method of the Popen object to read the output instead of directly calling `read()` on `proc.stdout`.
2. Checking if the Popen command is executed successfully and if any errors occur during the execution.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the correct function
class Fish(Generic):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell, version {}'.format(version)
```
