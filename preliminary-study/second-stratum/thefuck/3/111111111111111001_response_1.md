The error occurs in the 'info' function of the 'Fish' class. It appears that the 'info' function is trying to retrieve the Fish shell version using the 'echo $FISH_VERSION' command, but the test case is expecting the shell version to be retrieved using the '--version' flag.

The 'Popen' call in the 'info' function is using the command 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION', which may not retrieve the correct version format.

To fix the bug, the 'Popen' call needs to be modified to use the '--version' flag in order to retrieve the shell version in the expected format.

Here's the corrected code for the 'info' function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

class Fish(Generic):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this modification, the 'info' function should correctly retrieve the Fish shell version, and the test case should pass without any errors.
