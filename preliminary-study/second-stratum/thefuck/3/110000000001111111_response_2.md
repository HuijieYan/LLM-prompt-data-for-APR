The issue seems to be with the info() method of the Fish class. The method is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell using Popen, but it's not handling the subprocess correctly, resulting in a MagicMock value being returned instead of the actual version number.

The Popen function is not being used correctly. It is not being imported or instantiated. This is likely causing the method to return a MagicMock instead of the actual version number of the shell.

To fix this issue, the Popen function needs to be imported from the subprocess module and then instantiated properly. The stdout of the subprocess needs to be captured and read correctly to obtain the version number of the shell.

Here's the corrected code for the info() method:

```python
import subprocess

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = subprocess.Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)
    version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the method should be able to retrieve the actual version number of the Fish shell and return it correctly.
