The main issue here is that the Popen call is using the wrong command ('echo $FISH_VERSION' instead of '--version') and the assertion in the test function is failing because of the mismatch between the expected and actual values.

To fix the bug, we need to change the command in the Popen call to ['fish', '--version'] so that it matches the expected output in the test function.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
# file name: /Users/jerry/.abw/BugsInPy_Dir/BugsInPy_Cloned_Repos/thefuck/thefuck/shells/fish.py

from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(' ')[-1])
```

With this change, the function should now return the correct version of the Fish shell and the test function should pass without any assertion errors.
