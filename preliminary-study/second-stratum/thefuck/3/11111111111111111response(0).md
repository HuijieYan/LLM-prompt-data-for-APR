The error in the code seems to be due to the fact that the `info` method is not calling the correct command to get the version of Fish shell. The `Popen` call is using `echo $FISH_VERSION` to get the version, but the test case is expecting the version to be obtained using `fish --version`.

To fix this, the `Popen` call should be changed to use `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` method:

```python
def info(self):
    """
    Returns the name and version of the current shell
    """

    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.replace('fish, version', '').strip()  # Remove unnecessary text
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This modification should resolve the issue and make the test case pass.
