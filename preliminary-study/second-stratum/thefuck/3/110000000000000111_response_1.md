Potential Error Location:
The potential error is in the "info" function where the Popen method is used to execute a command and retrieve the output.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug occurs because the Popen method is not being used properly to retrieve the output of the command.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use the communicate method instead of reading directly from stdout to retrieve the output of the command.
2. Check for errors and handle them properly to avoid any potential issues.

Corrected Code:
```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
