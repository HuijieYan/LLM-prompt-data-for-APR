The potential error location within the problematic function is the command being passed to Popen. It should be 'fish', '--version' instead of 'fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the command 'fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION' will not retrieve the Fish shell version as expected.

To fix the bug, we need to change the command being passed to Popen to 'fish', '--version'. This will ensure that the Fish shell version is correctly retrieved.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def info(self):
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

With this correction, the function should correctly retrieve the Fish shell version and return it as expected.
