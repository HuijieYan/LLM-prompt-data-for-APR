The issue with the given function is that it is using a MagicMock object for the 'proc' variable, which should actually be an instance of the Popen class from the subprocess module. It also seems to be using a MagicMock for the 'proc.stdout.read' and 'proc.stdout' variables, which should be the actual process output and the output stream from the Popen instance.

To correct this, we need to replace the MagicMock objects with the actual Popen instance and its attributes.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import subprocess

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = subprocess.Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return 'Fish Shell, version {}'.format(version)
```
