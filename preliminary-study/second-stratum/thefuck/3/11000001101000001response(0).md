The potential error in the problematic function is with the Popen command. The command used to retrieve the fish shell version is incorrect, as it should be "fish --version" instead of "fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'". This is likely causing the function to crash and not return the expected version.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the command used with Popen to "fish --version" to correctly retrieve the fish shell version.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import subprocess

def info(self):
    proc = subprocess.Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                            stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()

    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected code, we use 'subprocess.Popen' with the command 'fish --version' to correctly retrieve the fish shell version.
