The error is occurring because the original function is attempting to retrieve the version number from the Fish shell using the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION'. However, the test case is expecting the version number to be retrieved using the command 'fish --version'.

To fix this bug, the function needs to be modified to execute the correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version number.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected code, the function will execute the command 'fish --version' to retrieve the Fish shell version number, as expected by the test case.
