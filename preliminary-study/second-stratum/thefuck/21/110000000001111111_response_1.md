The bug occurs in the function match within the specific git.py file of thefuck project. It's failing with the error "IndexError: list index out of range", which means that the split operation on command.script is not resulting in the expected number of elements.

The function is currently checking if the second element of the split command.script is equal to 'stash'. However, if the split command does not result in at least two elements, it will raise an IndexError. The error message in the GitHub issue indicates that the script is just 'git', so when the split is performed on it, it results in a list with only one element.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if there are at least two elements after splitting command.script before trying to access the second element.

Here's the corrected code for the match function:

```python
# Corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) > 1:
        return (split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```

In the corrected code, we first split the command.script and store the result in split_script. Then we check if the length of split_script is greater than 1 before trying to access the second element. If the length is greater than 1, we perform the comparison and return the result. Otherwise, we return False. This ensures that the function does not encounter an IndexError when accessing the second element of split_script.
