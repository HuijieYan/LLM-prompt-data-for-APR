Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the comparison `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` in the `match` function.

Reason for the bug: The error is likely occurring because the `command.script.split()[1]` is not handling cases where there might be additional output or variations in the `git` command output.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the `git` command is `stash` by using `command.script.startswith('git stash')` instead of splitting the command and then matching the second element.
2. Parse the `git` command output using regular expressions to properly identify the `stash` command.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

@git_support
def match(command):
    return command.script.startswith('git stash') and re.search(r'usage:', command.stderr)
```
