The potential error in the provided code is the use of `@git_support` decorator, which is not defined and is causing the function to throw an error.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `@git_support` decorator is not a standard Python decorator and needs to be defined in order for the code to run without error.

To fix the bug:
1. Remove the `@git_support` decorator from the function.
2. Define the `match` function without any decorators.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
