The error is occurring in the `match` function of the `git_fix_stash.py` file. The error message indicates that the issue is related to a list index being out of range, which suggests that the script.split() method is not returning enough elements to index.

The bug is due to the fact that the function assumes that the command.script.split() will always return at least two elements, and it is then directly indexing the second element without checking if it exists.

To fix this bug, we need to first ensure that the split list has at least two elements before indexing the second element.

Here is the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) > 1:
        return (script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
```

In the corrected code, we are first storing the result of `command.script.split()` in a variable called `script_parts`. Then, we check if the length of `script_parts` is greater than 1. If it is, we perform the comparison and return the result. If it's not, we directly return False. This way, we prevent the "list index out of range" error from occurring.
