The error occurs in the `match` function. The bug is caused by the line `command.script.split()[1]`, which is trying to access the second element of the split command, but it assumes that there will always be a second element, which may not be the case.

To fix this bug, we need to check the length of the split command before trying to access its second element to avoid the "IndexError: list index out of range" error.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
# Corrected function
def match(command):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_command) > 1 and split_command[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This modification first checks whether the split command has at least two elements before accessing the second element to compare it with 'stash'. This will prevent the IndexError and ensure that the function works as intended.
