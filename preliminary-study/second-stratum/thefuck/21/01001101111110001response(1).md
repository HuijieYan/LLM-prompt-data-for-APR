Potential Error Location:
The error is likely occurring in the line "command.script.split()[1]" because the program is trying to access the second element of the list without checking if the list has at least two elements.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug is caused by assuming that the "command.script" will always have at least two elements when using the "split()" function. If the "script" does not contain at least two words, then accessing index 1 will result in an "IndexError".

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the length of the split list before trying to access index 1.
2. Ensure that the "script" contains at least two words before attempting to split it.
3. Add error handling to account for scenarios where the split list does not have enough elements.

Corrected Code:
```python
# Corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    return (len(words) > 1 and words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By splitting the "command.script" into a list of words and checking its length before accessing index 1, we can ensure that the program does not encounter an "IndexError".
