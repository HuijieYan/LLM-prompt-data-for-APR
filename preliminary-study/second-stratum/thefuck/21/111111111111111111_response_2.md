The issue is occurring in the `match` function in the `git_fix_stash.py` rule. The error message indicates an `IndexError` on line 8, which suggests that the `split` function is not finding the expected index, likely due to an incorrect assumption about the command script.

The bug occurs because the buggy function assumes that the script will always have at least two parts after splitting by whitespace, and it tries to access the second part directly without checking. In the test case, the script is just "git" without any additional parameters, so when the split is attempted, it results in a single-element list and accessing index 1 causes an IndexError.

To fix this bug, the function should first check if the script contains the command "stash" before attempting to access index 1 after splitting. Additionally, it should also check for the presence of "usage:" in the stderr.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr:
        return True
    return False
```

This corrected function first splits the script and checks if it has at least two parts. If so, it verifies that the second part is "stash" and also checks for the presence of "usage:" in the stderr. If all conditions are met, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

This fix should address the IndexError and ensure that the function behaves correctly in identifying the "stash" command.
