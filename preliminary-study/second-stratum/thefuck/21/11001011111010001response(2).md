The buggy function "match" expects the command to have "stash" as the second word and "usage:" in the stderr. However, in the given test case, the stderr value is not provided to the "match" function, and it is causing an IndexError.

The potential error location is in the 'match' function where it tries to access the second word of the command, but it does not handle the case where the command is missing or has fewer words.

The bug occurred because the function did not handle cases where the command does not have a second word.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that the command has at least two words before trying to access the second word. If not, we should return False.

Here's the corrected code for the "match" function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    if len(words) < 2:
        return False
    return (words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
