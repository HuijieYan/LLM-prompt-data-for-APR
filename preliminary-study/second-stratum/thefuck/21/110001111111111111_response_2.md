The error occurs in the `git_fix_stash.py` file in the `match` function. The issue arises when the script is just "git" without any subsequent arguments. This causes an IndexError because the split() function on `command.script` returns a list with only one element ('git'), and trying to access the second index causes the error.

To fix this issue, we can check for the length of `command.script.split()` and ensure that there is at least one element before accessing the second index.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of `split_script` before accessing the second index, we prevent the IndexError from occurring, and the function will work correctly for cases where the script is just "git".
