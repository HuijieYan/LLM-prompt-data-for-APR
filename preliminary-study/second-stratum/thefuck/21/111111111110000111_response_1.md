The error occurs in the `match` function of the `git_fix_stash.py` file. The function tries to access the second word in the `command.script` by using `split()` and then check if it's equal to 'stash'. However, the error occurs because the `command.script` is just 'git', and when split, it results in a list with only one element, causing the index out of range error when trying to access the second element.

This bug occurs because the function assumes that the script will always contain at least two words, which is not the case if the script is just 'git'.

To fix this bug, we can add a check to ensure that the `command.script` contains at least two words before attempting to access the second word.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) >= 2 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By adding the `len(script_words) >= 2` check, we ensure that the `command.script` contains at least two words before attempting to access the second word. This prevents the index out of range error and fixes the bug.
