The error occurs due to the buggy implementation of the `match` function. The buggy function checks if the second word in the `command.script` is equal to 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is present in the `command.stderr`. The error message indicates an "IndexError: list index out of range", suggesting that the split operation on `command.script` is resulting in an empty list.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic of the `match` function to handle the case when the `command.script` has fewer than two words. As per the given input parameters and expected input for the test case, the `command.script` has only one word, i.e., 'git', and hence the attempt to access the second word using `split()[1]` is resulting in an IndexError.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

This corrected logic first checks if the `command.script` has more than one word before attempting to access the second word to avoid the IndexError. If the split results in a list with more than one element, then it checks if the second word is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the `command.stderr`.

With this correction, the `match` function should handle the case where the `command.script` has fewer than two words, and the provided test case should pass without any IndexError.
