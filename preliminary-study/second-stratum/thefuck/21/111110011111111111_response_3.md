The error is occurring in the `match` function at line 8. The error message indicates that the list index is out of range, which means that the `split()` function of the `script` attribute is not returning enough elements to access the second index.

The bug occurs because the `split()` method is being called on the `command.script` attribute, which is only 'git'. There is no second element in the resulting list when splitting by whitespace.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that there are at least 2 elements in the list resulting from the `split()` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
# Corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and (script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
