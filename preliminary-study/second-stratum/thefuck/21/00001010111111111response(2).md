The error occurs in the `match` function due to an `IndexError: list index out of range`. This means that the `command.script` does not contain the expected number of space-separated items.

The potential error location is in the line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)`, specifically at `command.script.split()[1]` where it tries to access the second element after splitting `command.script` by spaces.

The bug occurs because the `command.script` is not properly formatted as expected. In this case, it seems that `command.script` does not contain any spaces, leading to the `IndexError` when trying to access the second element.

To fix the bug, we can first check if there are at least 2 elements after splitting `command.script` before accessing the second element. If not, the function should return `False`. Additionally, we need to handle cases when `command.script` is empty or does not contain any spaces.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) >= 2:
        return (script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```

This fix ensures that we check for the number of elements after splitting `command.script` before trying to access the second element, avoiding the `IndexError`. If there are not enough elements, it returns `False`.
