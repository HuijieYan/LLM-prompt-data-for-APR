The error occurs in the `match` function. The buggy code tries to split `command.script` and access the second element, assuming that it exists. However, in the provided input, `command.script` is just 'git', and splitting it would result in a list with only one element. Therefore, trying to access the second element causes the "IndexError: list index out of range."

To fix this, we can first ensure that `command.script` contains at least two elements before accessing the second element. If not, we can return False immediately.

Below is the corrected `match` function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_21/thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) < 2:
        return False
    return (script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of `script_parts` before accessing the second element, we prevent the IndexError from occurring. Now the function should work as expected and pass the test case.
