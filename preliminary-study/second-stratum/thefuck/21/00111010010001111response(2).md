The error in the provided code is occurring at the line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)`. The error message indicates an IndexError, which means the index being accessed is out of range.

The bug is occurring because the function is directly accessing the second element of the split command.script without checking if it exists. This is causing the IndexError when the script is just "git" without any subsequent words to split.

To fix this bug, we can add a check to ensure that the split command.script has at least two elements before accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of the split_script before accessing its elements, we can prevent the IndexError.
