The error message indicates that there is an "IndexError" due to a "list index out of range" in the "match" function. Looking at the code, the potential error location is in the line `command.script.split()[1]`. This line is trying to access the second element of the list returned by `split()`, assuming that the input command has at least two words. 

The bug occurs because the function does not handle cases where the input command may not have at least two words. This causes the "IndexError" when trying to access an element that does not exist.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if the input command has at least two words before attempting to access the second element of the split list. Additionally, we need to check if the first word is "git" to ensure that we are matching the correct command.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def match(command):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_command) > 1
            and split_command[0] == 'git'
            and split_command[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected function, we first check if the length of `split_command` is greater than 1 to ensure that it has at least two words. Then, we check if the first word is "git" and the second word is "stash" before checking for the presence of 'usage:' in the command's stderr.
