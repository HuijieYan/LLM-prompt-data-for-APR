The error in the provided code is likely due to the `split()` method causing an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the split command script. 

To fix this bug, we can first check if the command script contains at least two elements before trying to access the second element. This will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_split = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_split) > 1 and script_split[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will first check if the length of `script_split` is greater than 1 before trying to access the second element. This will prevent the `IndexError` and ensure that the function works as expected.
