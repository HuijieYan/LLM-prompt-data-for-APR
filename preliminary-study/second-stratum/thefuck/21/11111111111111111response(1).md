The error occurs in the `match` function of the `git_fix_stash.py` file. The `IndexError: list index out of range` indicates that the code is trying to access an index in a list that does not exist.

The buggy function's purpose is to check whether the input command is related to `git stash`. The error is likely to occur when the input command script does not contain multiple words, causing `split()` to return a list with only one element, thus resulting in an index out of range error when trying to access the second element.

To fix this bug, a check for the length of the split command script should be added before attempting to access the second element to prevent the index out of range error.

The corrected code for the `match` function is as follows:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function first checks whether the length of the split script is greater than 1 before attempting to access the second element. If the length is not greater than 1, the function will return False, thus avoiding the index out of range error.
