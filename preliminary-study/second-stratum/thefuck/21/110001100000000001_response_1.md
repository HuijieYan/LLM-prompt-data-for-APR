The problem with the given function is that it is missing a wrapper function that is necessary for the @git_support decorator to work properly. 

To fix the bug, we need to add a wrapper function that takes in the original match function and returns it with the necessary modifications.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_21/thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# This is the corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[0] == 'git'
            and command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
