Potential Error Location: The error occurs in the `match` function where the script split is trying to access the second element of the split command, which may not exist if the script is just "git".

Reasons for the Bug: The buggy function does not handle the case when the `git` command is executed without any subsequent subcommand, causing the `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the split command.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: 
1. Check for the length of the split command before accessing its elements to avoid the `IndexError`.
2. Modify the condition to incorporate the case when the script is just "git", which should not trigger the check for 'stash' subcommand.
3. Handle edge cases where the command script may not contain the necessary subcommand information.

Corrected Code:
```python
# Function corrected to handle the case when the script is just "git"
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    if len(split_command) > 1:
        return (split_command[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
```
