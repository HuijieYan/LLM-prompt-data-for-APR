The bug in the provided code is due to the incorrect use of the `git_support` decorator, which is not defined in the code. This leads to a syntax error and will cause the function to fail when executed.

To fix this, the `git_support` decorator needs to be removed or defined properly. Additionally, the function does not have a proper input parameter defined. It seems that it expects a `command` object as input, but this is not explicitly declared in the function signature. 

Below is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[0] == 'git'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In this corrected code, the `command` object is declared as an input parameter to the `match` function. The `.split()[0]` is used to check if the first word in `command.script` is `'git'`, and the condition `'usage:' in command.stderr` is used to check for the presence of the 'usage:' string in the `stderr` attribute of the `command` object.
