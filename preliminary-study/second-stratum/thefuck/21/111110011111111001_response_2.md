The error message "IndexError: list index out of range" indicates that the buggy function is trying to access an index in a list that does not exist. This is happening in the line `command.script.split()[1]`, where the split function is trying to access the second element of the list resulting from splitting the command.script, but if the command.script doesn't contain any spaces, then an IndexError will be raised.

Since the buggy function is supposed to check if the second word in the script is 'stash', it should first check if there are any spaces in the script before attempting to split it.

To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to check if the script contains any spaces before attempting to split it. If there are no spaces in the script, then it means there is only one word, and in this case, we can assume that the word is already the command we are interested in.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
from collections import namedtuple

Command = namedtuple('Command', ['script', 'stdout', 'stderr'])

def git_support(fn):
    def wrapper(command):
        return fn(command)
    return wrapper

@git_support
def match(command):
    if 'stash' in command.script:
        return ('stash' in command.script.split()[1]
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
```

This corrected code checks if the word 'stash' is present in the command.script before attempting to split it. If 'stash' is not found in the command.script, the function returns False. If 'stash' is found, then it proceeds to check if the second word is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command.stderr.
