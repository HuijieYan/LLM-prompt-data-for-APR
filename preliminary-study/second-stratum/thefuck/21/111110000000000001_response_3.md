Potential Error Location:
The potential error is in the condition within the 'match' function, specifically in the comparison of the second word in the command to 'stash'.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function is not properly checking for the existence of the second word in the command. It is assuming that the second word will always exist, leading to a potential IndexError.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the command has at least two words before accessing the second word.
2. Update the condition to account for the possibility of the second word not existing in the command.

Corrected Code:
```python
# this is the fixed function
from functools import wraps

def git_support(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(command):
        if len(command.script.split()) > 1:
            return func(command) and 'usage:' in command.stderr
        else:
            return False
    return wrapper

def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' if len(command.script.split()) > 1 else False)
```
