The bug in the provided function is occurring because the 'time' module is not imported. This is causing a NameError when the function tries to access 'time.time()' without the 'time' module being imported first.

To fix the bug, we need to import the 'time' module at the beginning of the file. Here's the corrected code:

```python
import time  # add this line to import the time module

# class declaration containing the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By importing the 'time' module, we ensure that the 'time.time()' function can be accessed within the `__init__` method without causing a NameError.
