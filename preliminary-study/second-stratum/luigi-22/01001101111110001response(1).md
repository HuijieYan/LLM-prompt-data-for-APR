The error message indicates that there is an unsupported operand type for the addition operation, specifically involving a NoneType and an int. This suggests that there is either a missing value or an unexpected type in the addition operation.

Upon analysis of the provided buggy function, it seems that the issue lies in the default value of the 'last_active' parameter. When 'last_active' is not provided, it defaults to None. However, later in the code, there is an operation involving 'last_active' and a numeric value (time.time()). This causes the TypeError when trying to add NoneType and int.

To fix this bug, we need to provide a proper default value for 'last_active' or handle the case where 'last_active' is None.

Here's the corrected code for the __init__ method:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

In the corrected code, we check if 'last_active' is not None before assigning a value to it. If it is None, we set it to the current time using time.time(). This ensures that the addition operation involving 'last_active' will not result in a TypeError.
