The error occurs because the `last_active` parameter is initialized as `None` in the `__init__` function. Hence, when the `prune` function tries to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to `self.last_active`, it results in a `TypeError` due to unsupported operand types.

To fix this issue, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None`. We can set a default value of 0 for `last_active` if it is not provided. This will allow the addition operation to work as expected.

Here is the corrected code for the `__init__` function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else 0  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this change, the `last_active` parameter will default to 0 if not provided, ensuring that the addition operation in the `prune` function does not result in a `TypeError`.
