The error is likely occurring due to the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. This would cause an issue when trying to add `last_active` to `self.started` using the `+` operator.

To fix this issue, you can initialize the `last_active` parameter with a default value of `None` in the `__init__` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch if last_active is None
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By making the `last_active` parameter default to `None` and then setting it to `time.time()` if it is `None`, we avoid the `TypeError` that was occurring.
