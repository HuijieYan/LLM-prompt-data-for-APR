The error occurs when the `prune` method of the `Worker` class is called, and it seems to be related to an unsupported operand type for the `+` operation. This suggests that there might be an issue with the handling of the `last_active` parameter.

Upon analyzing the buggy function, it seems that the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default. Later in the code, it is used in a calculation involving time, which leads to the error.

To fix this bug, the `last_active` parameter should be initialized with a proper default value that can be used in the time calculation. It can be set to `0` (assuming that represents the default time when the worker is last active).

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=0):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By setting the `last_active` parameter to `0` by default, it ensures that the time calculation involving this parameter will not result in a `TypeError`.
