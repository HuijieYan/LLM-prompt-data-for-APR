The error in the provided code is that the '__init__' function is missing the 'import time' statement. This causes the 'time.time()' function to fail because the 'time' module is not imported.

To fix this bug, we need to import the 'time' module at the beginning of the file where the buggy function is located. This can be achieved by including the line "import time" at the top of the file.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
import time  # Add this import statement at the beginning of the file

# file name: /Users/jerry/.abw/BugsInPy_Dir/BugsInPy_Cloned_Repos/luigi/luigi/scheduler.py

# corrected function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
``` 

By adding the "import time" statement at the beginning of the file, the buggy function should work correctly without any errors related to the 'time' module.
