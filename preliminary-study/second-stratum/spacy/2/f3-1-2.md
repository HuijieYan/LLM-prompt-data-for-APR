How to reproduce the behaviour
My component class:

class MyComponent(object):
    name = "my_component"

    def __init__(self, nlp, **cfg):
        self.nlp = nlp
        self.categories = cfg.get("categories", "all_categories")  # cfg is EMPTY
I used entry points to add the component my_component to the pipeline. I updated the spacy_factories from setup.py. Then I run python setup.py sdist, generate the lib en_core_web_test_sm, and installed it by pip install.

However, when I run following code:

import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_test_sm", categories=["category1", "category2"])
the parameter cfg from __init__(self, nlp, **cfg): is EMPTY, so I can't get categories.

Why does this happen? Did I do something wrong? Is this a bug? I just followed the documentation.
