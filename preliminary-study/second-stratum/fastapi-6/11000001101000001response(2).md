Potential error location: 

The potential error in the provided function is related to the processing of the received body data and the validation of the required parameters. It seems that the function is not handling the received body data properly, which may lead to incorrect validation and errors in the output.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:

The bug may occur due to improper handling of the received body data, incorrect validation of the required parameters, and potential issues with the conditional logic inside the function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

1. Ensure proper handling of received body data for both form data and dictionary types.
2. Validate the required parameters based on their shape, type, and validation rules.
3. Refactor the conditional logic to handle different scenarios for form data and dictionary types more effectively.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import List, Optional, Union, Dict, Any, Tuple
from pydantic import ModelField, ErrorWrapper

async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]]
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias) if field.shape in sequence_shapes else received_body.get(field.alias)
                elif isinstance(received_body, dict):
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "") or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and field.shape in sequence_shapes and len(value) == 0):
                    if field.required:
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                    continue
                if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                    value = await value.read()
                elif field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

The corrected code includes proper handling of received body data for both form data and dictionary types, improved validation logic, and refactored conditional statements for better clarity and functionality.
