The error in the `request_body_to_args` function is likely related to the handling of repeated keys in form data. The test case `test_python_list_param_as_form` is sending data in the form of `{"items": ["first", "second", "third"]}`. However, the buggy function is not correctly handling repeated keys in form data and is leading to a 422 error instead of the expected 200 response.

The bug is likely occurring in the part of the function that handles processing form data and assigning values to the `values` dictionary and `errors` list. The function seems to be iterating over the required params and trying to access values from the received body, but the handling of repeated keys in form data is not correctly implemented.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle repeated keys in form data. One approach could be to modify the section that retrieves values from the received body to handle repeated keys and assign them as a list to the same key before validation happens.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Tuple, Optional, Union
from pydantic.main import ModelField
from pydantic.fields import FieldInfo
from pydantic.dataclasses import dataclass
from pydantic.class_validators import make_generic_validator
from copy import deepcopy

async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            field_info = get_field_info(field)
            if field_info:
                value: Any = None
                if received_body is not None:
                    if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    else:
                        value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                if value is not None:
                    if (
                        isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                        and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                        and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
                    ):
                        value = await value.read()
                    elif (
                        field.shape in sequence_shapes
                        and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                        and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                        and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
                    ):
                        awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                        contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                        value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                    v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                    if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                        errors.append(errors_)
                    elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                        errors.extend(errors_)
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected function, the processing of repeated keys in form data is handled by using the `getlist` method when `field.shape` indicates a sequence shape and the received body is of type `FormData`.

This should resolve the issue with the function not correctly handling repeated keys in form data and failing the test case.
