Analytical result can boost GPT's performance better than simply providing error message and test function code. As a illustration, the following analytical prompt make GPT-4 successfully fix the bug where it couldn't fix before. 

I suspect more "direct" analytical prompt should be present on GPT-3.5 in order to produce better result.

# Analytical prompt

This `_getcomposite` function has a bug, can you help to the write the whole fixed `_getcomposite` function implementation?

When users defined a _BASE setting, they explicitly don't want to use any of Scrapy's defaults. Therefore, we only use these entries from self[name] (where the defaults now live) that have a priority higher than 'default'. 

we also know that self[name] is of type `<class 'scrapy.settings.BaseSettings'>` with a method called `get_settings_priority` to retrieve the priority of a setting. `BaseSettings` is also iterable and the key of each entry is the priority of the setting. 

Use global `get_settings_priority()` function to get 'default' priority and use `self[name].getpriority()` method to get the priority of each entry in `self[name]`.

buggy code:

```python
import six
import json
import copy
import warnings
from collections import MutableMapping
from importlib import import_module

from scrapy.utils.deprecate import create_deprecated_class
from scrapy.exceptions import ScrapyDeprecationWarning

from . import default_settings

def get_settings_priority(priority):
    # ... other code ...

class BaseSettings(MutableMapping):

    # ... other code ...

    def getpriority(self, name):
        # ... other code ...

    def _getcomposite(self, name):
        # DO NOT USE THIS FUNCTION IN YOUR CUSTOM PROJECTS
        # It's for internal use in the transition away from the _BASE settings
        # and will be removed along with _BASE support in a future release
        basename = name + "_BASE"
        if basename in self:
            warnings.warn('_BASE settings are deprecated.',
                          category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning)
            compsett = BaseSettings(self[name + "_BASE"], priority='default')
            compsett.update(self[name])
            return compsett
        else:
            return self[name]
```

# Result

To fix the `_getcomposite` function based on your description, we need to ensure that only settings with a priority higher than 'default' from `self[name]` are used when `_BASE` is set. Given the provided description and buggy code, here's the corrected implementation of the `_getcomposite` function:

```python
import warnings
from scrapy.exceptions import ScrapyDeprecationWarning
from scrapy.settings import BaseSettings, get_settings_priority

class Settings(BaseSettings):

    # ... other code ...

    def getpriority(self, name):
        # ... other code ...

    def _getcomposite(self, name):
        # DO NOT USE THIS FUNCTION IN YOUR CUSTOM PROJECTS
        # It's for internal use in the transition away from the _BASE settings
        # and will be removed along with _BASE support in a future release
        basename = name + "_BASE"
        if basename in self:
            warnings.warn('_BASE settings are deprecated.',
                          category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning)
            compsett = BaseSettings(self[basename], priority='default')

            default_priority = get_settings_priority('default')
            for key in self[name]:
                priority = self[name].getpriority(key)
                if priority > default_priority:
                    compsett[key] = self[name][key]
            
            return compsett
        else:
            return self[name]
```

In this implementation, we have the following changes:

1. We start by checking if the `_BASE` setting exists in `self`.
2. If `_BASE` exists, we issue a deprecation warning as before.
3. We create a `BaseSettings` object `compsett` with the `_BASE` settings.
4. We fetch the 'default' priority level using the `get_settings_priority()` function.
5. We then iterate over `self[name]` and update `compsett` only with the settings that have a higher priority than the default.

Note that I've changed the class name to `Settings` as per typical Scrapy convention, but you should use the correct class name as defined in your Scrapy project.

Also, please ensure that you replace `# ... other code ...` with the actual implementation code of `BaseSettings` and `getpriority` methods, as well as the `get_settings_priority` function definition. The above code assumes that these methods and functions are properly defined and work as described in your context.
