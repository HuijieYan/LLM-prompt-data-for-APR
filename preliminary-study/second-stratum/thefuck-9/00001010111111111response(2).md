The error message indicates an IndexError at line 32 of the `get_new_command` function. This error occurs when popping items from the `command.script_parts` list if the index is out of range. This is likely happening because the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` is being checked in the `command.script_parts` list, but the presence of these arguments is not being verified before trying to access their index.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are present in the `command.script_parts` list before trying to access their index. Additionally, if the `-u` option is found, we need to increment the index by 1 before removing the item from the list.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
# Corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_options = ['--set-upstream', '-u']
    for option in upstream_options:
        if option in command.script_parts:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            # Increment index if the option is '-u'
            if option == '-u':
                command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            break

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected code ensures that the presence of `--set-upstream` or `-u` options is verified before accessing their index in the `command.script_parts` list. Additionally, it correctly handles the removal of the `-u` option and its argument.
