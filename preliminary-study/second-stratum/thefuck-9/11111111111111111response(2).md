The error occurs in the `get_new_command` function. The `IndexError` is raised at line 27, which is caused by trying to remove the `--set-upstream` part and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list, regardless of whether they exist in the list or not.

The buggy function aims to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command parts. However, if these options are not present in the `command.script_parts` list, the function still attempts to remove them, resulting in the `IndexError`.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to first check if the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options exist in the list before attempting to remove them. If they exist, the function should remove them and their corresponding argument.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this modification, the function first checks if `--set-upstream` or `-u` exists in the command parts list before attempting to remove them. This prevents the `IndexError` from occurring.

Once the corrected function is applied, the test cases should pass without raising any errors.
