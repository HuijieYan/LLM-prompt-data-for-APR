The error message "IndexError: pop index out of range" indicates that the buggy function is trying to pop an index from a list that does not exist. This likely occurs in the code block where the "upstream_option_index" is being used to remove elements from the "command.script_parts" list.

The reason for the bug is that if the "--set-upstream" or "-u" options are not found in the "command.script_parts" list, the "upstream_option_index" remains -1, and the subsequent pop operations using -1 as index result in an IndexError.

One approach to fixing the bug is to check if "upstream_option_index" is not -1 before attempting to pop elements from the list.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # Need to check again after the first pop
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By adding a check for "upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts)" before the second pop operation, we ensure that we are not trying to pop an index that doesn't exist. This should fix the IndexError issue.
