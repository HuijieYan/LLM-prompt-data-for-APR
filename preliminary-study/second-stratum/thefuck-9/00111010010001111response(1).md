The bug seems to be related to the index retrieval and removal of the '-u' option in the command. 

The cause of the bug is that when the '-u' option is found in the command, it is removed from the `command.script_parts`, but the subsequent removal operation is trying to remove the element at the same index again, causing an IndexError.

To fix the bug, we need to store the first index of the found option and then remove it once. Additionally, the condition to check if the option is found should be fixed to use `if` instead of `try-except` blocks.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index > -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # After removing the option, it is required to decrease the index by 1
        # Because the previous removal operation shifts the elements to the left
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index - 1)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
