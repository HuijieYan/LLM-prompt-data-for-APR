The error message "IndexError: pop index out of range" indicates that the function is trying to remove an item from a list using `pop()` method at an index that does not exist in the list. This is likely happening in the section of code where the function is trying to remove `--set-upstream` or `-u` and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list. 

The bug occurs because the code is not handling the case where the `-u` flag is found. As a result, if the `--set-upstream` flag is not present, it tries to find the index of `-u` and then remove it, without considering the fact that if `-u` is found, the index will be for `-u` and not for `--set-upstream`.

To fix this bug, we can modify the logic in the function to properly handle both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags. We should also add checks to ensure that we are not trying to remove an index that is out of range in the `command.script_parts` list.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
# Corrected function
from typing import List

def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        if upstream_option_index + 1 < len(command.script_parts):  # check if the next argument exists
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index + 1)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
