The error occurs in the `get_new_command` function. When the `git push -u` command is passed, the function tries to remove the '-u' option even though it has already been removed, resulting in an `IndexError` when attempting to remove it again.

To fix this issue, we can modify the code to check if the upstream_option_index is valid before attempting to remove the '-u' option.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index is not -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if command.script_parts[upstream_option_index] == '-u':
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

This corrected code should handle the '-u' option removal properly and prevent the IndexError from occurring.
