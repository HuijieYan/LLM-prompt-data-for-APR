The error message from the test functions indicates that there is an issue with the comparison of lists. Specifically, there are differences in elements that involve quotes and formatting, such as double quotes around the values.

The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it includes double quotes around the values of the dictionary items, which is not intended. The function should return a list of strings for the command, without any additional formatting or quotation.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function mistakenly adds double quotes around the values when creating the command list based on the input dictionary.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to construct the command without adding any additional formatting, quotes, or characters around the dictionary values.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In the corrected function, the line `command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]` constructs each command element without using double quotes around the dictionary values. This should resolve the comparison issues observed in the error message from the test functions.
