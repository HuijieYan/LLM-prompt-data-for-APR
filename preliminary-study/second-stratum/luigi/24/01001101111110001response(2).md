Potential error location: The issue seems to be with how the "Prop=Value" dictionary key-value pair is being handled in the _dict_arg function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug seems to be occurring because the "Prop=Value" key-value pair is being incorrectly represented within the command list. It appears that it is being enclosed within double quotes when it should not be.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes surrounding the "Prop=Value" key-value pair in the command list.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # avoid using value again as it conflicts with the outer scope
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # remove unnecessary double quotes
    return command
```
