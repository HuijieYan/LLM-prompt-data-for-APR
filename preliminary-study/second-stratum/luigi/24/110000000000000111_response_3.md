Potential error location: The bug may be in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]` where the format of the string may not be correct.

Reasons for the bug: The bug occurs because the string formatting is not done correctly. The extra double quotes around the format may cause issues when building the command.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Remove the extra double quotes around the format string.
2. Use string concatenation instead of the list to add elements to the command.

```python
# Corrected function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(f"{name}={prop}={val}")
    return command
```
