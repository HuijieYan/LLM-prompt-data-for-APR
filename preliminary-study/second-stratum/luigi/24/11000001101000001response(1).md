Potential error:
The _dict_arg function is supposed to construct a command based on the input dictionary "value". However, the bug occurs because the inner loop variable "value" conflicts with the input parameter "value". This can lead to unexpected behavior and errors.

Reason behind the bug:
The variable "value" is being used for two different purposes within the same block of code. This can cause confusion and errors, as the outer "value" is intended to represent the input parameter, while the inner "value" represents the values in the dictionary being iterated over.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, it is necessary to use a different name for the inner loop variable to avoid conflicts with the input parameter. This will ensure that the correct values are being used and concatenated to the "command" list.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change the variable name to 'val' to avoid conflicts
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Use the new variable 'val'
    return command
```
