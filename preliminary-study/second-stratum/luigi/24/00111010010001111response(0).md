The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to handle a dictionary input and create a command list based on the key-value pairs in the dictionary. It seems that the function is failing to properly handle the input dictionary and construct the command list as expected.

Given that the specific runtime type and value info for the input parameter is not available, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of the issue. However, based on the stack trace from the test function, it seems that the function may not be constructing the command list properly.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `_dict_arg` function to handle the dictionary input in a more robust way and construct the command list correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # changed variable name from value to val to avoid conflict
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # removed unnecessary double quotes around prop=value
    return command
```

In the corrected code:
- The variable name conflict inside the loop is resolved by renaming the loop variable `value` to `val`.
- The unnecessary double quotes around the `prop=value` pair are removed to ensure the command list is constructed correctly.

By making these changes, the `_dict_arg` function should be able to properly handle the input dictionary and construct the command list as expected.
