The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it doesn't handle the case when `value` is not a dictionary. It assumes that `value` is always a dictionary and tries to iterate over it, leading to a crash when `value` is not a dictionary.

To fix this issue, we need to add a check to ensure that `value` is a dictionary before trying to iterate over it. Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In this corrected function, we first check if `value` is not None and if it is a dictionary before iterating over its items. This will prevent the function from crashing if `value` is not a dictionary.
