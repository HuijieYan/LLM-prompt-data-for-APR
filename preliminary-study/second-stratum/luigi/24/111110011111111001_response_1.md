The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is due to the unnecessary double-quoting of the value when constructing the command list. This results in an AssertionError during test execution due to a mismatch between the expected and actual command lists.

The potential error location is within the lines generating the command list inside the `_dict_arg` function.

The bug occurs because the function incorrectly adds double quotes around the key-value pairs in the command list, leading to an incorrect command format.

To fix the bug, the double-quoting around the key-value pairs should be removed to generate the command list with the correct format.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # using 'val' variable name instead of 'value' to avoid confusion
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # removed unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pair
    return command
```
