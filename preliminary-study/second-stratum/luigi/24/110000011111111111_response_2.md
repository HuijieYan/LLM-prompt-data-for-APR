The bug in the '_dict_arg' function lies in how it constructs the 'command' list. It incorrectly adds quotes around the key-value pairs of the dictionary when adding them to the 'command' list, which results in incorrect comparisons in the test cases.

The reason behind the bug is that the function includes double quotes around the key-value pairs when adding them to the 'command' list. This is not necessary and leads to incorrect comparisons with the expected output in the test cases.

To fix the bug, the function should add the key-value pairs to the 'command' list without including quotes around them.

Here's the corrected code for the '_dict_arg' function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Updated this line to remove unnecessary quotes
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will correctly construct the 'command' list without including unnecessary quotes around the key-value pairs, ensuring that it produces the expected results when used in the test cases.
