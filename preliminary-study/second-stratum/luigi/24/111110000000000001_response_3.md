Error location: The error is likely occurring in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`, where the values are being added to the `command` list as strings enclosed in double quotes, which may not be intended.

Reason for the bug: The `command` list is being populated with strings that are formatted using double quotes, which may not be the correct format for the command being built.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: The correct approach would be to directly populate the `command` list with the elements without enclosing them in double quotes.

Corrected code:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
