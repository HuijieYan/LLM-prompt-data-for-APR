The issue arises because the original function generates the command list incorrectly by adding unnecessary quotes around the property and value pairs in the command list. As a result, the test cases fail when comparing the expected and actual command lists.

The incorrect portion of the code is where the values are added to the command list using unnecessary quotes.

To fix the bug, remove the unnecessary quotes when adding property and value pairs to the command list. 

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In the corrected function, unnecessary quotes have been removed from the property and value pairs when adding them to the command list. This change will address the issues observed in the test cases and resolve the bug.
