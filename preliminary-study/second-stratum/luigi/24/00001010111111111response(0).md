The error is due to the incorrect formatting of the command list in the `_dict_arg` function. The function is intended to take a dictionary and convert it into a list of command-line arguments. However, the current implementation is using string formatting and adding unnecessary quotes around the values.

To fix this bug, we should remove the unnecessary quotes around the values and simply add the key-value pair to the command list.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This revised function removes the unnecessary quotes and instead directly adds the key-value pairs to the command list. This should fix the bug and ensure that the command list is generated correctly.
