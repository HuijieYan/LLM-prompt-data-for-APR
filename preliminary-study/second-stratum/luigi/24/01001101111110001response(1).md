The error seems to be related to the formatting of the command list in the `_dict_arg` function. The test case is expecting the command list to have elements like `"Prop=Value"`, but it seems that the function is inserting double quotes around each element.

The buggy behavior is likely due to the line: `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. This is adding each item as a string with double quotes.

To fix this issue, we should remove the double quotes around the `{0}={1}`. Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the command list will be formatted without unnecessary double quotes, and the test should pass without any issues.
