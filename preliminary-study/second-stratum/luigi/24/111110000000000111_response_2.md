Potential error location: The error may be in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]` within the for loop.

Reasons behind the bug:
The code is trying to build a command based on the input dictionary `value`, but it is using the same variable `value` within the for loop, which overwrites the original dictionary. Additionally, using double quotes around the key-value pair may not be necessary and could lead to issues in command execution.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
1. Use a different variable name for the loop iteration to avoid overwriting the original dictionary.
2. Remove the unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pair.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{}={}".format(key, val)]
    return command
```
