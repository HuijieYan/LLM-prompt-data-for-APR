Potential error location: The error could be in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]` within the `_dict_arg` function.

Reason for the bug: The bug seems to be caused by adding the `name` and formatted string as separate elements in the `command` list. This can lead to the command not being constructed correctly.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, we need to modify the line mentioned above to properly construct the command list by appending the formatted string directly.

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append('{0}={1}'.format(prop, val))
    return [name] + command
```

The corrected code appends the formatted string to the `command` list and then returns the combined list of `name` and `command`.
