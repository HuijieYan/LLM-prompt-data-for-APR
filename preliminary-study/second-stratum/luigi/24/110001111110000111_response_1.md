The error is occurring because the _dict_arg method is not correctly processing the dictionary value. The method iterates through the dictionary and adds the key-value pairs to the command list, but it is wrapping the value in double quotes even if it is not a string. This leads to a mismatch between the expected and actual list in the test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the _dict_arg method to handle dictionary values appropriately without wrapping them in double quotes unnecessarily.

Here's the corrected code for the _dict_arg method:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            if isinstance(prop_value, str):
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, prop_value)]
            else:
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, repr(prop_value))]
    return command
```

In this corrected code, we are checking if the value in the dictionary is a string or not. If it is a string, we add it as it is to the command list. If it is not a string, we use the repr() function to add it, ensuring that it is represented correctly in the command list. This fix ensures that the values are handled appropriately regardless of their data type.
