The issue in the given code is that the `command` list is not being constructed properly when looping through the dictionary items. Additionally, unnecessary quotes are being added in the command list. 

The function `_dict_arg` is not constructing the `command` list correctly and is also incorrectly adding quotes to the properties. It should construct the command list by appending the key-value pairs of the dictionary directly without unnecessary quotes.

To fix this, we can modify the code as follows:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Renaming value to val to avoid conflicts
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Append key-value pairs without quotes
    return command
```
