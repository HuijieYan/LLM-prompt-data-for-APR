The bug occurs in the `_dict_arg` function, where the dictionary items are not being appended correctly to the `command` list. The function incorrectly adds quotation marks around the property and value.

The reason behind the bug is that the function is incorrectly constructing the command list for dictionary items. It is using double quotes around the dictionary items, which is causing the test cases to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes from around the property and value when adding them to the command list.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected function removes the unnecessary double quotes from around the property and value pairs in the command list. Now it should work correctly with the provided test cases.
