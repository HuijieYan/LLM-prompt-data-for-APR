The error occurs in the `_dict_arg` function. The issue seems to be with the formatting of the command list. The function is adding the `name` as the first element of the command list, followed by a string in the format `"Prop=Value"`. This is causing the assertion error in the test case.

The reason behind the bug is that the function is incorrectly formatting the elements in the `value` dictionary for generating the command list.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_dict_arg` function to properly format the elements in the `value` dictionary and generate the command list accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will properly format the elements in the `value` dictionary and generate the command list in the expected format.
