The issue with the function `_dict_arg` is that the values for the dictionary should not be enclosed in double quotes. The input parameter `value` is a dictionary and for each key-value pair, we need to concatenate the `name` and the key-value pair strings without enclosing them in double quotes.

To fix the issue, the double quotes around the key-value pair should be removed in the command list concatenation section.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name + '=' + prop + '=' + val)
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will return the appropriate list of command values without having the key-value pairs enclosed in unnecessary double quotes.
