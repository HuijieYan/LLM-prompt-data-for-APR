The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from the unnecessary quotation marks being added when constructing the `command` list. This is happening because of the usage of `"{0}={1}"` format within quotation marks, which is adding additional quotes to the output.

To fix this bug, the `"{0}={1}"` format should be used without additional quotes to ensure that the values are added to the `command` list as intended.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the unnecessary quotation marks around the `prop=val` pairs will be eliminated, and the expected test results should now match the actual results without any assertion errors.
