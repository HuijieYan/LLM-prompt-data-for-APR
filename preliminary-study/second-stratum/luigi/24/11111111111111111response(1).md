The error occurs when comparing the expected list of arguments with the actual list of arguments passed to the `Popen` function. The error message indicates that the specific difference is related to the formatting of the value passed to the `--conf` argument.

The bug in the `_dict_arg` function causes the value passed to the `--conf` argument to be enclosed in double quotes, resulting in a mismatch when compared with the expected value.

To fix the bug, the value for the `--conf` argument should not be enclosed in double quotes.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed double quotes around {1}
    return command
```

By removing the double quotes around the `{1}` in the format string, the bug in the function is fixed. This change ensures that the value for the `--conf` argument is not enclosed in double quotes, resolving the mismatch in the test case.
