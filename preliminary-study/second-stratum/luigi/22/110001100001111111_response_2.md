The error is not explicitly provided, but based on the given information, it seems that the issue lies in the `__init__` function of the Worker class in the scheduler.py file. The function is missing the module 'time' which is used to access the `time` module in Python. This is the reason why `time.time()` is failing to execute.

To fix the bug, the `time` module needs to be imported at the start of the file. The corrected function is shown below.

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/luigi_22/luigi/scheduler.py
import time

# this is the corrected function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By importing the `time` module, the issue with `time.time()` not being accessible should be resolved.
