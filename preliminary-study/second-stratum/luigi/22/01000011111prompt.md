Please fix the function/method provided below and provide the corrected function/method as the output.


The buggy function source code is following:

```python
# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.bid = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}

```
