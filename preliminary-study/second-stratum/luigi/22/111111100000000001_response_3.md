The issue with the provided code is that the `time` module is not imported, but it is being used in the `__init__()` function. This will result in a `NameError` when the code is executed.

To fix this issue, the `time` module needs to be imported at the beginning of the file.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/luigi_22/luigi/scheduler.py
import time  # Add this line to import the time module

# class declaration containing the fixed function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
