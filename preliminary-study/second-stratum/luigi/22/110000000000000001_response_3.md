The potential error in the provided function is that it seems to be the constructor for a class, but it is missing the `self` parameter. The `__init__` method should have `self` as the first parameter to refer to the instance of the class.

The bug occurs because the `self` parameter is missing in the function definition, and as a result, the function will not have access to the instance attributes and methods.

To fix the bug, the `self` parameter needs to be added as the first parameter to the `__init__` method.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
