The error occurs because the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default, and the code attempts to add an integer to it in the `prune` method. This results in a `TypeError`.

To fix this, we should initialize `last_active` with a default value of `time.time()` in the `__init__` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `Worker` class:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # TODO: Do something to remove the worker
            pass
```

In this corrected code, the `last_active` parameter is initialized with the current time using `time.time()` if it is `None`, ensuring that we do not encounter a `TypeError` when trying to add an integer to it.
