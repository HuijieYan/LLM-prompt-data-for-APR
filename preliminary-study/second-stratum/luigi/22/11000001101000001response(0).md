The potential error location is the `__init__` method in the `Worker` class in the `scheduler.py` file. 

The error is occurring because the `time` module used in the `__init__` method is not imported in the `scheduler.py` file.

To fix this bug, you can import the `time` module at the beginning of the `scheduler.py` file. Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
# file name: /Users/jerry/.abw/BugsInPy_Dir/BugsInPy_Cloned_Repos/luigi/luigi/scheduler.py
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By importing the `time` module, the `time.time()` method can be used to assign the current time to the `started` attribute of the `Worker` class.
