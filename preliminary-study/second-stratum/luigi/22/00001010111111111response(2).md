The error message indicates that there is a TypeError because the code is trying to add 'NoneType' and 'int' in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class. This implies that the `last_active` attribute is not being initialized properly and is set to None, causing the error.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that `last_active` is initialized with the correct default value if no value is provided during object creation. 

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method of the Worker class:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By using the ternary conditional operator `last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()`, we ensure that `last_active` is initialized to the current time if no value is provided during object creation.

This should fix the TypeError and ensure that the `last_active` attribute is properly initialized.
