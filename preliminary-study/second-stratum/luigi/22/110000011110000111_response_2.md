The error occurs in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class. The error message indicates that a `TypeError` is raised due to unsupported operand types for the `+` operator. Specifically, it says that 'NoneType' and 'int' are the unsupported types for addition.

This error occurs because the `last_active` attribute of the `Worker` object is initialized as `None`, and when trying to perform addition in the `prune` method, it leads to a `TypeError`.

To fix this issue, we need to initialize the `last_active` attribute with a default value of `None` only if it is not provided during object creation. Additionally, we need to handle the case when `last_active` is `None` in the `prune` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            pass  # Add your prune logic here
        else:
            pass  # Add your else logic here
```

With these changes, the `last_active` attribute in the `__init__` method ensures that it is initialized with the current time if no value is provided. The `prune` method also handles the case where the `last_active` attribute is `None`.
