The error occurs due to the `last_active` variable being initialized as `None` in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class, and then trying to perform an addition operation with it in the `prune` method.

To fix this error, we need to assign a default value to `last_active` in the `__init__` method. One approach is to use the current time as the default value.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=time.time()):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By providing the `time.time()` as the default value for `last_active`, it ensures that the variable has a valid timestamp to perform operations with.
