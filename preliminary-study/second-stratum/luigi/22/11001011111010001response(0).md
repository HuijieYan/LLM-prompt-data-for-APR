Potential error location: The error is likely occurring on the line `self.last_active = last_active`, where `last_active` is set to `None` by default and then used in a calculation with `time.time()`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The error is occurring because `last_active` is set to `None` by default, and when `time.time()` is called, Python does not support adding `None` with an `int`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if `last_active` is `None` before performing the calculation.
2. Set a default value for `last_active` other than `None`, such as 0.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else 0  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        pass # Implementation for prune function
```
