The error message indicates that there is a TypeError in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class. The error occurs because the `last_active` attribute is sometimes set to `None`, and the code tries to perform arithmetic operations on it.

To fix the bug, the `last_active` attribute should be initialized to the current time in the `__init__` method. This will ensure that `last_active` is always an integer representing the seconds since epoch.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else int(time.time())  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

In this corrected code, we have used a conditional statement to set the `last_active` attribute to the current time if it is `None`. This ensures that `last_active` will always have a value representing the seconds since epoch, and the TypeError will be avoided.
