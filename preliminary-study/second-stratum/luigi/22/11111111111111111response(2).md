The error message indicates that there is a TypeError occurring in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class. Specifically, the error is happening when trying to add a `NoneType` and an `int` together.

The potential error location is within the `prune` method, specifically in the line: `if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():`

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `last_active` attribute of the `Worker` class is initialized as `None` in the `__init__` method. When the `prune` method tries to add this `NoneType` to an integer value, it causes a TypeError.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that `last_active` is initialized to an appropriate default value in the `__init__` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
# this is the corrected __init__ method
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.bid = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By using a conditional statement, we set the `last_active` attribute to the current time if it is initially `None`. This ensures that the `prune` method will not encounter a TypeError when trying to add `last_active` to the `worker_disconnect_delay`.
