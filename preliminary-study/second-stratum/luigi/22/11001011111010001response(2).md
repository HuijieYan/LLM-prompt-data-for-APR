Potential error location: the variable last_active is set to None when the function is initialized. However, later in the code, possibly in the prune function, there is an unsupported operand type error because last_active is being used in a calculation.

Reason for the bug: The last_active variable is being initialized with a default value of None. When it is used in a calculation without being properly checked, it leads to the unsupported operand type error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if last_active is None before using it in any calculation.
2. Initialize last_active with a suitable default value if it is not provided when the function is called.

Corrected code:
```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Add the prune logic here
        pass
```
