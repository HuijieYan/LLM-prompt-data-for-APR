The error occurs in the `prune` method called on the `Worker` object. The error message indicates that the `self.last_active` is of type `NoneType`, which causes a `TypeError` when trying to add it to an integer (`config.worker_disconnect_delay`).

The potential error location is the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. It is initialized with a default value of `None`, and it is being used without proper handling in the `prune` method.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned a proper value in the `__init__` method, resulting in it being `None` when accessed in the `prune` method.

To fix the bug, the `last_active` parameter should be handled properly in the `__init__` method. It should be initialized with the current time if no value is provided. This ensures that it always has a valid value when accessed in other methods like `prune`.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter is initialized with the current time if no value is provided, ensuring that it always has a valid value. This should fix the `TypeError` when calling the `prune` method.
