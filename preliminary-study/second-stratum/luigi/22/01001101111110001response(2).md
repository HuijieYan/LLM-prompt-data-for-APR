The error message "TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'int'" suggests that the issue is related to trying to use the '+' operator with a 'NoneType' and an 'int', which usually occurs when trying to add None to an integer.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the initialization of the 'last_active' variable. It is being set to None initially, which causes the error when trying to perform arithmetic operations on it.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that 'last_active' is being set to None, and later on, arithmetic operations are being performed on it, resulting in the TypeError.

To fix the bug, we need to initialize 'last_active' with a valid value if it is None.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else int(time.time())  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

In the corrected code, we initialize 'last_active' with the current time using 'time.time()' if it is None. This will ensure that 'last_active' always has a valid value and will not cause the TypeError when performing arithmetic operations on it.
