Potential error location: The error is occurring at the line `if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():` inside the `prune` method.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The error message indicates that the code is trying to perform addition on a `NoneType` and an `int`, which is not supported in Python.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: The `last_active` attribute is initialized with a default value of `None` in the `__init__` method, and it seems that the code is assuming that `last_active` will always have a valid value when `prune` method is called. To fix the bug, you can add a condition to check if `last_active` is not None before performing addition with it.

Corrected code:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # perform prune operation here
            pass
```
