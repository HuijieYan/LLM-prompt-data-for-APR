Potential error location: The issue may be in the initialization of the last_active and started variables. The time.time() is being assigned to self.started, but it is not being assigned to last_active if last_active is None.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the last_active variable is not being properly initialized. If last_active is None, it should be set to the current time as well.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: To fix this bug, we need to explicitly check if last_active is None, and if it is, then assign the current time to it.

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = time.time()
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
```

By adding the check for last_active being None and assigning the current time to it if it is, we can ensure that the last_active variable is properly initialized.
