The potential error in the provided code is with the incorrect use of the `__init__` method to initialize the Worker class. The `__init__` method should be a part of a class and should not have a leading double underscore. In addition, there is a missing import statement for the `time` module which is used in the `time.time()` method.

The bug occurred because the `__init__` method was not defined properly, and it was missing the necessary import statement for the `time` module.

To fix the bug, the `__init__` method should be defined without the leading double underscore, and the necessary import statement for the `time` module should be added.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With these changes, the `__init__` method should now work correctly to initialize the `Worker` class.
