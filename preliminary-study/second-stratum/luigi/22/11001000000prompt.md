Please fix the function/method provided below and provide the corrected function/method as the output.


The buggy function source code is following:

```python
# file name: /Users/jerry/.abw/BugsInPy_Dir/BugsInPy_Cloned_Repos/luigi/luigi/scheduler.py

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.bid = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}

```

A test function for the buggy function:
```python
    def test_worker_prune_after_init(self):
        worker = luigi.scheduler.Worker(123)

        class TmpCfg:
            def __init__(self):
                self.worker_disconnect_delay = 10

        worker.prune(TmpCfg())
```
