The issue here is that the `last_active` variable is initialized as `None` in the `__init__` method, and then it is used in the `prune` method without first checking if it is `None`. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to perform addition with `None` and an integer.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `prune` method to check whether `last_active` is `None`. If it is `None`, it should be handled differently in the comparison.

Here's the corrected `prune` method:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}

def prune(self, config):
    if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
        # perform the prune action here
        pass
```

In the corrected `prune` method, we added a check to make sure that `last_active` is not `None` before using it in the comparison. If it is `None`, the comparison will be skipped, avoiding the `TypeError` that occurred previously.
