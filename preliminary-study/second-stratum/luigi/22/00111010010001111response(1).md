The error occurs in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class. The problem is that the `last_active` attribute is initialized as `None` in the `__init__` method and is later used in the `prune` method without any check for its value being `None`.

To fix this bug, we can initialize `last_active` with the current time if it is not provided in the `__init__` method. This way, we ensure that `last_active` always holds a valid timestamp, and it won't cause any issues when used in the `prune` method.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # perform pruning operation
            pass
```

With this fix, the `last_active` attribute will always have a valid value, and the `prune` method should work as expected without any `TypeError`.
