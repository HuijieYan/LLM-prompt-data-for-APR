The problem is occurring in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class, specifically in the line `if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():`. The error message indicates that there is a TypeError because the addition operation is being performed on a `NoneType` and an `int`.

The reason for the bug is that the `last_active` attribute is initialized as `None` in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class, and then it is used in the `prune` method without any checks for its value.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.last_active` is `None` in the `prune` method before performing the addition with `config.worker_disconnect_delay`. If it is `None`, we should handle it accordingly to prevent the TypeError.

Here is the corrected code for the `Worker` class:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # perform the deletion or other necessary action
            pass
```

With this correction, we check if `self.last_active` is not `None` before performing the addition operation, thus preventing the TypeError.
