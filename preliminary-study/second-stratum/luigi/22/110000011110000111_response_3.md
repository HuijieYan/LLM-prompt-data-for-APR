The error occurs in the prune method of the Worker class. The error message indicates that it is trying to perform an addition operation with a 'NoneType' and an 'int', specifically self.last_active (which is initialized as None) and config.worker_disconnect_delay. This is causing a TypeError.

The potential error location is within the __init__ method of the Worker class. The last_active attribute is being initialized with a default value of None, causing the TypeError when it is used in the prune method.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that last_active is always initialized as an integer representing the seconds since epoch. We can achieve this by setting last_active = time.time() in the __init__ method if no value is provided.

Here's the corrected code for the __init__ method of the Worker class:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By making this change, the last_active attribute is initialized with the current time in seconds since epoch if no value is provided, preventing the TypeError in the prune method.

With this correction, the test function should run without errors.
