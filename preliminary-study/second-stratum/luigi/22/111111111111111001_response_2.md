The error is occurring because the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class. Later in the `prune` method, there is an attempt to add this `None` value with an integer, leading to a `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, we need to initialize `last_active` with the value provided as an input, and if no value is provided, set it to the current time using `time.time()`.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this modification, the `last_active` parameter will be initialized with the provided value, or with the current time if no value is provided.

This should resolve the `TypeError` occurring in the `prune` method.
