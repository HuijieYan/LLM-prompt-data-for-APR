Potential error location:
The error is likely occurring because the `time` module has not been imported, so the `time.time()` function call will result in a NameError.

Reasons behind the bug:
The `time` module needs to be imported in order to use the `time.time()` function. Since it hasn't been imported, the code will result in a NameError and fail to execute.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
Import the `time` module at the beginning of the file using `import time`.

Corrected code:
```python
import time  # import the time module

# class declaration containing the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
