The potential error in the given code is in the `__init__` method of the Worker class. The error seems to be related to the use of the `time` module without importing it in the file.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the `time` module is being used without being imported, leading to a `NameError` when trying to access `time.time()`.

To fix the bug, the `time` module needs to be imported at the beginning of the file where the `__init__` method is defined.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    # Other methods of the Worker class go here
```

By importing the `time` module at the beginning of the file, the `time.time()` function can be used without causing a `NameError`.
