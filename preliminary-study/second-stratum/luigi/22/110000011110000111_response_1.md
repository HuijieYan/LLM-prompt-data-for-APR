The error message indicates that the code is trying to perform addition with a 'NoneType' and an integer in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class, specifically at the line `if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():`. This suggests that the `last_active` attribute of the `Worker` class has not been properly initialized.

The bug occurs because the `last_active` attribute is initialized as a default parameter with a default value of `None`. When the `prune` method is called, it attempts to perform addition with `None` and an integer, resulting in a `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, the `last_active` attribute should be properly initialized either during object creation or in the `__init__` method. Additionally, it would be helpful to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` in the `prune` method.

The corrected code for the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class is as follows:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this modification, the `last_active` attribute will be initialized as the current time if it is passed as `None`. This will prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring previously.
