The potential error location within the problematic function is the wrong assignment of the `worker_id` input parameter to the `self.id` attribute within the `__init__` method. The `worker_id` input parameter is correctly assigned to the `self.id` attribute, but the method should have the `self` parameter first, which it currently does not.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug are:
- The `__init__` method is missing the `self` parameter, which is required for instance methods in Python classes.
- The `self.id` assignment is missing the `self` parameter.

To fix the bug, the `__init__` method should have the `self` parameter first, and the `self.id` should be assigned the value of `worker_id`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/luigi_22/luigi/scheduler.py

# corrected function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With the corrected code, the `__init__` method now has the required `self` parameter and correctly assigns the `worker_id` to the `self.id` attribute.
