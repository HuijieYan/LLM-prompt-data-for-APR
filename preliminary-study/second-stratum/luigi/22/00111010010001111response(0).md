Potential error location: The error is occurring at the line `if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():`

Reason for the bug: The `last_active` attribute is not being properly initialized in the `__init__` function, hence causing a TypeError when trying to add it to `config.worker_disconnect_delay`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Initialize the `last_active` attribute properly in the `__init__` function.
2. Ensure that the `last_active` attribute is being updated as necessary in the code.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import time

# class declaration containing the corrected function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch if last_active is None, set it to current time
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # perform prune action
            pass
```
