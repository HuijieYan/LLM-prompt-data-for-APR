The error occurs because the function `match` is trying to access the second element of the split command script, but since the input to the function is just "git", there is no second element to access.

To fix this bug, the function should first check if the length of the split command script is greater than 1 before trying to access its second element.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
