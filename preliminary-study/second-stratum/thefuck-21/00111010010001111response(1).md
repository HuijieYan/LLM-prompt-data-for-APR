The error is occurring in the `match` method of the `git_fix_stash` rule. The error message indicates that there is an `IndexError` when trying to split the command script.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the original code does not handle cases where the command script does not have any additional arguments after 'git'.

To fix this, we should first check if the length of the split command script is greater than 1 before accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` method:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of `split_script` before accessing index 1, we can avoid the `IndexError` when the script doesn't have any additional arguments after 'git'.
