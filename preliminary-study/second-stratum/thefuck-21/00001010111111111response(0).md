The error message indicates that the `IndexError` occurred in the `match` function at line 8, where `command.script.split()[1]` is being accessed. This error is likely due to the fact that `command.script.split()` does not have at least two elements in the list, causing the index to be out of range.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function expects the command script to have at least two parts (split by whitespace), and the second part should be 'stash'. However, in the test case provided, the command script is simply 'git', which results in a list index out of range error when trying to access index 1.

To fix this bug, we can add a condition to check the length of the split result before accessing index 1. If the length is less than 2, the function can return `False` to indicate that the match is not found.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) < 2:
        return False
    return (script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
