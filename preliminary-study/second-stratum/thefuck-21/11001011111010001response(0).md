The error is likely occurring in the line `command.script.split()[1]` in the `match` function. The error message "IndexError: list index out of range" suggests that there is an attempt to access an index that does not exist in the list returned by `split()`.

This error is likely happening because the `command.script` does not contain any whitespace, so `split()` returns a list with only one element, and trying to access index 1 results in an IndexError.

To fix this, we can first check if the split list has at least two elements before trying to access the index.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) >= 2 
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of `split_script` and ensuring it has at least two elements before accessing index 1, we can avoid the IndexError.
