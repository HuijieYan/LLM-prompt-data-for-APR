The error occurs in the function `match` inside the file `git_fix_stash.py`. The function is using `command.script.split()[1]` to check if the second word in the script is 'stash', which causes an `IndexError` when the script does not have enough words.

The reason for the bug is that the code does not handle cases where the script does not contain a second word, causing the split to result in an IndexError.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if the script contains at least two words before trying to access the second word. If not, the function should return False.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    if len(words) < 2:
        return False
    return (words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This code first splits the script into words and checks if there are at least two words. If there are, it compares the second word to 'stash' and checks if 'usage:' is in the command.stderr. If the split results in fewer than two words, the function returns False, indicating that the match condition is not met.
