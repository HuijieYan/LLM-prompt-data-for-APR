Potential Error Location:
The potential error lies in the comparison `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` within the `match` function. 

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurred because the `match` function is trying to access the second element of the `command.script.split()` list without checking if the list has at least 2 elements. This can lead to an "index out of range" error if the split result has fewer than 2 elements.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split result has at least 2 elements before comparing the second element with 'stash'.

Corrected Code:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script = command.script.split()
    return (len(script) > 1 and script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
