The error message "IndexError: list index out of range" suggests that the buggy function is trying to access an index of a list that does not exist. This could be happening when splitting the command script, as indicated by the error occurring on `command.script.split()[1]`.

The potential error location is in the line `command.script.split()[1]` because it assumes that there is always a second element after splitting the command script, which may not be the case.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is most likely due to the input `command.script` not containing the expected format for splitting.

To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to check if there is at least one element after splitting the command script before accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
# Corrected function
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

By checking if the length of `script_parts` is greater than 1 before accessing the second element, we can avoid the "IndexError: list index out of range" and ensure that the function works as expected.
