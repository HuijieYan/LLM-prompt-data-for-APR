The error message indicates that the 'IndexError: list index out of range' occurs at line 8 of the git_fix_stash.py file, specifically in the `match` function where it tries to split the `command.script` attribute. This suggests that the error is likely due to the `command.script` attribute not containing the expected value.

The `command.script` attribute is being split and the second index is being checked for equality with 'stash'. However, if the `command.script` does not contain a second element after splitting, the `IndexError` will occur.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case when `command.script` does not contain the expected value after splitting. We can modify the function to first check if the split command has more than one element, and then proceed to check the equality.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_command) > 1 and split_command[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By first checking the length of the split command, we can ensure that the second index exists before trying to access it. This should resolve the 'IndexError' that was occurring.
