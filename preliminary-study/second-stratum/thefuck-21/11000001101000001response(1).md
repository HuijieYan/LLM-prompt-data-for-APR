The error in the current function is that it checks for the presence of 'usage:' in the command.stderr to determine if the command is a git stash command. This is not a reliable way to identify a git stash command, as the presence of 'usage:' in the stderr does not exclusively indicate a git stash command.

Instead, the function should check if the command starts with 'git stash' and if it returns an error. This would be a more reliable way to determine if the command is a git stash command.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[0] == 'git'
            and command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and command.returncode != 0)
```

With this correction, the function will now correctly identify git stash commands based on the script and return code, and it should pass the provided test case.
