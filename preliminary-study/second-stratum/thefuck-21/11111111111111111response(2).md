The test case "test_not_match" is trying to assert that the "match" function returns False when provided with a Command object representing a git command with stderr containing a usage message for the "stash" subcommand.

The error occurs in the "match" function on the line "return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)" due to the "command.script.split()[1]" expression. This expression tries to extract the second word from the command script, which is causing an IndexError when the script contains only the "git" command.

The bug occurs because the "match" function assumes that the command script will always contain at least two words, and attempts to access the second word without checking if it exists first. This assumption is not valid for all cases.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the length of the split command script is at least 2 before accessing the second word. If it's less than 2, then the command doesn't include a subcommand, and we should return False.

Here's the corrected code for the "match" function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) < 2:
        return False
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
