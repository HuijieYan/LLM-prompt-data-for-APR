The error message "IndexError: list index out of range" suggests that there is an issue with the code trying to access an index that does not exist in a list.

Upon analyzing the function, it seems that the buggy part may be in the line `command.script.split()[1]`. This is likely causing the IndexError because it's trying to access the second element of the split command, but if the command doesn't have a second element, it will result in an IndexError.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to first check if there is a second element in the split command before trying to access it. If there isn't, we can return False.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

With this change, the function will first check if there is a second element in the split command, and only proceed to check for 'stash' and 'usage:' in stderr if there is. This should prevent the IndexError from occurring.
