# buggy class docstring

```text
Vectorized string functions for Series and Index. NAs stay NA unless
handled otherwise by a particular method. Patterned after Python's string
methods, with some inspiration from R's stringr package.

Examples
--------
>>> s.str.split('_')
>>> s.str.replace('_', '')
```
