The error message indicates that there is a TypeError due to unsupported operand types for the multiplication operation. This is likely because the code is not handling the case of NaT (Not a Time) correctly when performing operations on the DataFrame and Series.

To fix this bug, the code needs to handle the case of NaT when performing operations between a DataFrame and a Series.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import pandas as pd
import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
import numpy as np
from pandas.core.arrays import timedelta
from pandas.core.ops import roperator

def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):

    right = np.array(right)

    if isinstance(right, timedelta.Timedelta) and np.array_equal(right, np.array(pd.NaT)):
        result = pd.DataFrame({i: pd.NaT for i in range(len(left.columns))})
        return result

    if roperator.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, pd.DataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, pd.Series) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, pd.Series):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)
    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the `right` operand is a timedelta and is equal to `pd.NaT` (Not a Time). If it is, we return a DataFrame with NaT values. Otherwise, we proceed with the original logic for handling different operand types. This correction addresses the issue with NaT and should resolve the TypeError in the test case.
