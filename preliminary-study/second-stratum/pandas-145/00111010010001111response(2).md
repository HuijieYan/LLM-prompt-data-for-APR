Certainly! Here's the full corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandas.core.computation import expressions

def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    new_data = None
    
    # handle NaN or NaT values in the Series
    if isinstance(right, (pd.Series, pd.DataFrame)):
        right = right.where(~right.isnull(), np.nan)
    
    def column_op(a, b):
        return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns)}
    
    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected code, we've included the necessary imports and modified the function to handle NaN and NaT values within the Series before performing the evaluation. This should prevent the TypeError from occurring when performing arithmetic operations involving NaT values.
