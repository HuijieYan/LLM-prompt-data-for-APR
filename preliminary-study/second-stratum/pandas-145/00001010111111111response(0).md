The error message indicates that there is a TypeError when the function tries to perform the multiplication operation on a numpy array and a NaTType (Not a Time) object.

The potential error location is within the `na_arithmetic_op` function where the operation is attempted and results in a TypeError when trying to perform the operation.

The bug occurs because the function `dispatch_to_series` is supposed to handle different cases of data types, including handling NaTType, but it is failing to do so in this scenario.

To fix the bug, a check for NaTType should be implemented in the `dispatch_to_series` function, and appropriate action or operation should be performed based on the type of input.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
from pandas.core.dtypes.generic import ABCSeries, ABCDataFrame
from pandas.core.indexing import check_bool_indexer
from pandas.core import common as com

from pandas.core.indexes.values import (
    ensure_index,
    ensure_index_from_sequences,
    extract_array,
)
from pandas.core.indexing import check_bool_indexer
from pandas.core.arrays import ExtensionArray

from pandas.core.indexing import check_bool_indexer

def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, NaTType):  # added to handle NaTType
        def column_op(a, b):
            return np.nan  # return NaN for NaTType

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected code, we have added a condition to handle the case of NaTType specifically within the `dispatch_to_series` function. When `right` is an instance of NaTType, the function returns NaN for that case.
