The error is occurring while performing the multiplication operation between the DataFrame `df` and the Series `ser`. The error message indicates that the multiplication operation is unsupported between a 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'. 

This is happening because the function `dispatch_to_series` is not handling the case when one of the operands is a 'NaT' (Not a Time) type properly.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case when one of the operands is 'NaT' and perform the operation accordingly, or return 'NaT' if the other operand is also 'NaT'.

Here's the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandas.core.arrays import datetimes, timedelta

def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    if isinstance(left, pd.DataFrame) and isinstance(right, pd.Series):
        # Handle the case when right is a Series
        if right.isna().any():
            return pd.Series([np.nan] * len(left), index=left.index)
        elif isinstance(right.array, timedelta.NaTType):
            return pd.Series([np.nan] * len(left), index=left.index)
        else:
            return left.apply(func, other=right)
    else:
        # Perform the operation as usual for other cases
        return func(left, right)

# Test the corrected function
def test_td64_op_nat_casting():
    ser = pd.Series(["NaT", "NaT"], dtype="datetime64[ns]")
    df = pd.DataFrame([[1, 2], [3, 4]])

    result = dispatch_to_series(df, ser, lambda x, y: x * y)
    expected = pd.DataFrame({0: [pd.NaT, pd.NaT], 1: [pd.NaT, pd.NaT]})
    pd.testing.assert_frame_equal(result, expected)

# Run the test
test_td64_op_nat_casting()
```

In the corrected code:
1. We handle the case when the right operand is a 'NaT' type and return a Series with NaN values if 'NaT' is encountered. Otherwise, we apply the function `func` to the left and right operands using the `apply` method.

2. We also provide a test function to verify the correctness of the corrected `dispatch_to_series` function. The test function creates a DataFrame and a Series similar to the original test case and checks if the output matches the expected result.
