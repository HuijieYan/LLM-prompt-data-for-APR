The issue seems to be with the `"_dict_arg"` method which is used to create a command list based on a dictionary of values. The problem seems to be with the way the dictionary items are being added to the command list.

The error message from the test function shows that there is a difference in how the dictionary item `Prop=Value` is being added to the command list. It appears that the current implementation is adding `Prop=Value` with double quotes around it, which is not the expected format.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the way dictionary items are added to the `command` list. We should remove the double quotes and just add the key-value pair in the format `prop=value`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` method:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected function should now properly construct the command list based on the dictionary values without adding unnecessary double quotes.
