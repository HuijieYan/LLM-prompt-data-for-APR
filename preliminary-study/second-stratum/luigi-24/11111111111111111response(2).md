The error in the code is caused by the `_dict_arg` function. The function is intended to create a list of commands based on the key-value pairs in the input dictionary, but it is incorrectly wrapping the values in double quotes. This is causing the assertion error in the test function as it is comparing the actual list of commands with an expected list of commands that does not have the values wrapped in double quotes.

To fix this issue, the function should append the command as key=value without double quotes.

Here is the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
