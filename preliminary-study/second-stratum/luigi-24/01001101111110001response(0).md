The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is related to the formatting of the command list. The function is trying to construct a list of command arguments from a dictionary, but it is incorrectly adding double quotes around the values.

The error message from the test function indicates that there is a mismatch in the format of the command arguments. The expected command list should not have values wrapped in double quotes.

To fix this bug, the function should construct the command list without adding double quotes around the values.

Here is the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Construct the command without quotes
    return command
```

In the corrected code, the values are added to the command list using the `format` method without wrapping them in double quotes. This should resolve the bug and make the function behave as expected.
