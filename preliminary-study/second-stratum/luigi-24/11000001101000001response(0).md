The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. This line is intended to create a command list with the name and value pairs from the input dictionary. However, it has a bug where it overrides the `value` variable from the function parameter with the loop variable, which leads to unexpected behavior.

The bug occurs because the loop variable `value` is overwriting the function input parameter `value`. This causes the command list to only include the last key-value pair from the input dictionary.

To fix the bug, the loop variable names should be different from the function input parameter names. Additionally, the `name` and `value` elements should be properly formatted when added to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for k, v in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(k, v)]
    return command
```
