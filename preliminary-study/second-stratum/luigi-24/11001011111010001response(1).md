The issue with the _dict_arg function is that it is adding double quotes around the property and value pairs in the command list, which is causing the mismatch in the test case. The error message specifically indicates that there is a difference in the formatting of the property and value pair.

To fix the bug, the function should not add double quotes around the property and value pairs.

Here's the corrected code for the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will correctly format the property and value pairs without adding unnecessary double quotes. This should fix the bug and address the issue observed in the test case.
