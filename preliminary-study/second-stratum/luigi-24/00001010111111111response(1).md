The error occurs when comparing the `proc.call_args[0][0]` with the expected list. The error message indicates that the lists differ, specifically in the element at index 18, where the expected value does not have quotes around it.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `_dict_arg` method. The method is supposed to construct a command list based on the input dictionary `value`, but it is incorrectly including quotes around the value. This is causing the elements to differ when compared to the expected list in the test case.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `_dict_arg` method incorrectly adds quotes around the values in the command list, which is not expected.

To fix the bug, the `Prop=Value` string should not be enclosed in quotes. The method should simply append the `name` and formatted string `"{0}={1}".format(prop, value)` to the command list.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` method:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the method will construct the command list without enclosing the property values in quotes, which aligns with the expected values in the test case.
