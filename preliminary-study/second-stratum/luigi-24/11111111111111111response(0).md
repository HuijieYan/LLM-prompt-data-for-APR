The error in the code seems to be related to the function `_dict_arg` in the `SparkSubmitTask` class. The error message indicates a difference in the lists being compared, specifically with the element `"'Prop=Value'"`. This suggests that the `"` characters are being included in the list, which is not expected.

The potential error location within the `_dict_arg` function is the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. This line is incorrectly adding the property and value within double quotes, resulting in the extra `"` characters being included in the list.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code appending `'"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)` is adding unnecessary double quotes around the property and value pair.

To fix this bug, the unnecessary double quotes should be removed from the appended items in the `command` list.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append("{0}={1}".format(prop, val))
    return command
```

In this corrected code, we are appending `name` and the formatted property-value pair directly to the `command` list without including unnecessary double quotes. This should resolve the issue mentioned in the error message and produce the expected output.
