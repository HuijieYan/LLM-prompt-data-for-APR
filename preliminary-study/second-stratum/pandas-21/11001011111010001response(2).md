The issue in the provided function is that it is trying to access a key that does not exist in the index of the Series. This is resulting in a KeyError when the test case is executed.

To fix this issue, the _get_with function needs to be modified to handle the case where the key does not exist in the index of the Series. This can be done by adding a try-except block to catch the KeyError and return a meaningful error message.

Here is the corrected code for the _get_with function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    try:
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        elif not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
        return self.reindex(key)
    except KeyError as e:
        raise KeyError(f"Key '{key}' not found in the index") from e
```

In the corrected code, I added a try-except block to catch the KeyError and raise a more informative error message. This will prevent the function from crashing and provide a clear indication of the issue to the users.
