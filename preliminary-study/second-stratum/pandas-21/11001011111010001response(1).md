The cause of the bug seems to be in the `_get_with` function. It appears that the function is trying to retrieve an item from a pandas Series using a key that is not found in the index, which causes a KeyError.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to ensure that the function does not return an item that is not present in the Series index. This could be done by adding a check to verify if the key exists in the index before trying to retrieve the item.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if key not in self.index:
        raise KeyError(f"{key} is not in the index")
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    return self.reindex(key)
```

With these changes, the `_get_with` function should now properly handle the cases where the key does not exist in the Series index, preventing a KeyError from occurring.
