The bug is occurring when using a list as an indexer for a Series. This behavior is inconsistent with how other indexers such as arrays or Index objects are handled.

The error message indicates that "None of [Index(['C'], dtype='object')] are in the [index]", which suggests that the list indexer is not being handled correctly.

The potential error location within the function is in the part where it checks for the type of the key and tries to handle it differently based on its type.

To fix this bug, the function needs to handle list indexers in a similar way to how it handles array-like indexers. It should also consider whether the key should be treated as a label-based or positional indexer and adjust its behavior accordingly.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, (Index, list)):
        if all(isinstance(k, (int, np.integer)) for k in key):
            return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        if key.dtype == bool:
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected code, the function first checks if the key is a slice, then if it is a DataFrame, then if it is a tuple. If none of these conditions are met, it checks if the key is not list-like and if not, it proceeds to handle the key based on its type.

This approach aims to handle the different types of indexers in a more consistent and aligned manner.
