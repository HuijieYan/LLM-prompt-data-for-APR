The bug in the `_get_with` method is likely related to how the `key` input parameter is being handled. The error message indicates that a `KeyError` is not being raised as expected, which suggests that the key is not being processed correctly within the function.

The potential error location within the function could be the conditional statements that handle different types of `key`. It's possible that the function is not correctly identifying the type of `key` and therefore not handling the key appropriately.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to verify the type of `key` at the beginning of the function and then handle it accordingly. Additionally, adding explicit checks for specific key types (like lists, ndarrays, etc.) and ensuring that they are processed correctly could help resolve the issue.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` method:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not pd.api.types.is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, pd.Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = pd.api.types.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected code, there are explicit checks for different types of `key` and appropriate handling for each type. This should help address the issues observed in the test cases.
