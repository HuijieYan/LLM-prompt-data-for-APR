The error "ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate" indicates that there is an issue with concatenating arrays. Looking at the test case `test_quantile_empty_no_columns`, it seems that the problem is related to the creation of empty series or dataframes when certain conditions are met.

Upon analyzing the buggy function, the potential error location is in the lines where the `result` is being created. Specifically, the `self._constructor(result)` and `self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)` lines are most likely causing the issue when trying to construct the result.

The reason behind the bug is that the code is not handling the case when there are no columns in the dataframe correctly, and it is failing to create the `result` dataframe or series.

To fix the bug, the code needs to be modified to handle the case where there are no columns in the dataframe. This can be achieved by adding conditions to check if there are no columns and then return an empty dataframe or series accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
        
    self._check_percentile(q)
    
    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1
    
    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T
    
    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )
    
    if result.ndim == 2:
        if result.size > 0:
            result = self._constructor(result)
        else:
            result = pd.DataFrame(result)
    else:
        if result.size > 0:
            result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)
        else:
            result = pd.Series(result, name=q)
    
    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T
    
    return result
```

In the corrected code, conditions have been added to check if the `result` has any elements before using the `_constructor` or `_constructor_sliced` methods to avoid the ValueError. If the result is empty, it returns an empty dataframe or series accordingly.
