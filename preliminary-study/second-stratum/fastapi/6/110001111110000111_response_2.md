1. The test cases provided are using the `client.post` method to send a POST request and check the response status code and the JSON response. The error message indicates that the response status code is 422 instead of the expected 200.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function appears to be in the function `request_body_to_args`. Specifically, the issue seems to be related to the handling of form data and validation of the received data.

3. The bug is likely occurring because the function `request_body_to_args` is not properly handling repeated keys in form data. As mentioned in the GitHub issue description, the current implementation does not support collecting repeated keys and assigning those values as a list to the same key before validation.

4. One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the `request_body_to_args` function to handle repeated keys in form data. This can be achieved by identifying and collecting repeated keys in the form data before validation, and then assigning those values as a list to the same key.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Optional, Union, Tuple
from pydantic.fields import ModelField
from pydantic import params, UploadFile, sequence_shapes, sequence_types, BaseConfig, MissingError, ErrorWrapper
from copy import deepcopy
import asyncio

async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        form_data = {}
        for param in required_params:
            value = None
            if received_body and param.alias in received_body:
                if param.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body[param.alias], list):
                    form_data[param.alias] = received_body[param.alias]
                else:
                    form_data[param.alias] = [received_body[param.alias]]
        
        for field in required_params:
            value = form_data.get(field.alias)
            if value is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                    if isinstance(field.info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                        value = await value.read()
                    elif isinstance(field.info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                        awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                        contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                        value = sequence_shapes[field.shape](contents)
                
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
            else:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
    
    return values, errors
``` 

In this corrected code, the `request_body_to_args` function now properly handles repeated keys in form data by collecting the values for the same key as a list before validation. This should resolve the issue described in the GitHub issue and allow the test cases to pass successfully.
