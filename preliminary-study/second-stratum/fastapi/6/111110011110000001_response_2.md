The error code 422 indicates an issue with the request body, meaning that the request body is not being processed correctly by the `request_body_to_args` function.

Upon analyzing the provided code, it seems that the issue might be related to processing form data containing non-typing sequences, such as lists, sets, and tuples. The current implementation of the `request_body_to_args` method does not handle these non-typing sequences correctly, leading to the error.

The bug occurs because the function does not account for non-typing sequences when processing the received body. It tries to retrieve values from the received body using the `field.alias`, assuming that the received body is a dictionary.

To fix the bug, you need to update the function to handle non-typing sequences appropriately. Specifically, when processing form data with non-typing sequences, the function should handle the data as a list and extract values from it.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    # Handle non-typing sequences as lists
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)

            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue

            # Validate and process value
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

With this correction, the `request_body_to_args` function should correctly handle form data containing non-typing sequence types like lists, sets, and tuples. This should address the issues raised by the test cases and error messages provided.
