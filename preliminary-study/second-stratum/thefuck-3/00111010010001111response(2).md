Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the usage of Popen to execute the 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION' command. 

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug is likely happening because the Popen command is not being used in a way that properly captures the stdout.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: We can fix the bug by using the communicate() method of the Popen object to capture the stdout and stderr.

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def info(self):
        from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE)
        stdout, stderr = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
In the corrected function, we import Popen and PIPE from the subprocess module, and then use the communicate() method to capture the stdout. This should fix the issue and prevent the recursive loop.
