The issue seems to be with the command being used to get the version of the Fish shell. The command being used is 'echo $FISH_VERSION' but the expected command should be 'fish --version'.

It seems like the 'info' function of the 'Fish' class is not executing the correct command to get the version of the Fish shell. This is evident from the assertion error in the test function, which shows that the expected version string is 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' but the actual version string is 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the 'info' function to execute the correct command to get the version of the Fish shell.

Here's the corrected code for the 'info' function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE

def info(self):
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(', ')[1])
```

In this corrected code, we are using the correct command 'fish --version' to get the version of the Fish shell. We then extract the version number from the output and return it in the desired format. This should fix the issue encountered in the test case.
