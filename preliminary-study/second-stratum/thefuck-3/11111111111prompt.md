Please fix the function/method provided below and provide the corrected function/method as the output.


The buggy function source code is following:
```python
# file name: /Users/jerry/.abw/BugsInPy_Dir/BugsInPy_Cloned_Repos/thefuck/thefuck/shells/fish.py

# class declaration containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    # ... omitted code ...

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def info(self):
    
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)

```

A test function for the buggy function:
```python
# file name: /Users/jerry/.abw/BugsInPy_Dir/BugsInPy_Cloned_Repos/thefuck/tests/shells/test_fish.py

    def test_info(self, shell, Popen):
        Popen.return_value.stdout.read.side_effect = [b'fish, version 3.5.9\n']
        assert shell.info() == 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'
        assert Popen.call_args[0][0] == ['fish', '--version']
```

Error message from test function:
```text

A gitHub issue title for this bug:
```text
thefuck -v hangs Fish Shell initialisation with Oh-My-Fish plugin
```

The associated detailed issue description is:
```text
Oh-My-Fish's TheFuck plugin uses thefuck -v to decide when to regenerate functions. That triggers a recursive loop because of shells/fish.py:Fish.info().

Fix is on it's way.
