The issue in the `info` function seems to be with the command used to retrieve the fish shell version. The `Popen` command is trying to execute `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`, but the actual command should be `fish --version`.

The reason for the bug is that the Popen call is using the wrong command to get the fish shell version. This results in a different output than expected, causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, the `Popen` command should be modified to use `fish --version` instead of `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
