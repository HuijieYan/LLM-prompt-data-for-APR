The error seems to be occurring in the `info` method of the `Fish` class. The method is trying to execute a command using `Popen` and read the output to get the version of the Fish shell. However, it seems to be failing and returning an incorrect value.

The reason for the bug could be that the `Popen` command is not being handled properly, or there might be an issue with reading the output from the command.

To fix the bug, we can use the `subprocess` module to execute the command and capture the output. We can also use `check_output` function to simplify the process. Additionally, we can handle the potential errors that might occur during the execution of the command.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` method:

```python
import subprocess

class Fish(Generic):
    # ... omitted code ...
    
    def info(self):
        try:
            version = subprocess.check_output(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL, shell=True, text=True).strip()
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        except subprocess.CalledProcessError:
            return 'Fish Shell version not found'
```

With these changes, the `info` method should now properly execute the command and return the version of the Fish shell. Additionally, it handles potential errors that may occur during the execution of the command.
