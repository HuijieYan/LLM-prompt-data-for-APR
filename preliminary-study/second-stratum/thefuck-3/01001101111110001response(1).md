The potential error in the provided function is that it is trying to retrieve the Fish shell version using the command "echo $FISH_VERSION", but in the test case, it is expecting the version to be retrieved using the command "fish --version".

The reason behind the bug is that the command used to retrieve the version in the function ("echo $FISH_VERSION") is not providing the expected output format that the test case is looking for.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to update the command used to retrieve the version in the function to "fish --version". This will ensure that the function returns the version string in the expected format.

Here is the corrected code for the function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """
    Returns the name and version of the current shell
    """

    
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(' ')[-1])
```
