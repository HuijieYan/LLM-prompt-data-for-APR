The test case is trying to verify the output of the `info` function for the Fish shell. The expected output is 'Fish Shell 3.5.9', but the actual output includes the string 'fish, version' before the version number. This indicates that the `Popen` command used in the `info` function is not returning the expected output.

The potential error in the `info` function is the command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` passed to `Popen`. This command is trying to retrieve the Fish shell version, but it's not returning the expected format.

The reason for the bug is that the command in the `Popen` function is incorrect. It should be changed to `['fish', '--version']` to retrieve the version in the expected format.

To fix the bug, the command passed to `Popen` should be updated to `['fish', '--version']`. This will return the version in the format 'fish, version 3.5.9', which aligns with the expected output of the test case.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """
    Returns the name and version of the current shell
    """

    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
