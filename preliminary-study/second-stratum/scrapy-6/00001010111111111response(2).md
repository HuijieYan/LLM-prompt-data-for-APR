Explanation:
The error message indicates that the expected output is not being generated by the `convert_image` function, particularly with the `getcolors` method. This suggests that the image conversion and manipulation logic inside the function is not working as intended.

Additionally, the bug could be due to the mishandling of image modes and formats, leading to incorrect conversions and thumbnail generation.

To fix the bug, the following approaches could be considered:
1. Ensure that the conditions for checking the image format and mode are correctly implemented.
2. Properly convert the image to RGB mode and JPG format based on the given conditions.
3. Handle the generation of thumbnails with the correct aspect ratio and size.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageOps
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = ImageOps.exif_transpose(image) if hasattr(ImageOps, 'exif_transpose') else image
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected code, the conditions for format and mode checking have been placed correctly. Additionally, the generation of thumbnails has been updated to ensure the preservation of the image ratio. Lastly, the usage of the `ImageOps.exif_transpose` method is included for compatibility with different versions of the Pillow library.
