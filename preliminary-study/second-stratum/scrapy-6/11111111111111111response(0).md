The error occurs at the assertion `self.assertEquals(converted.getcolors(), [(10000, (205, 230, 255))])`. This assertion fails because the `converted` image does not have the expected colors.

The potential error lies in the `convert_image` function, specifically in the conditional statement `if image.mode != 'RGB':`. This conditional statement currently converts the image to RGB format regardless of its original format. This means that the conditional is too broad and does not handle the case where the image is in RGBA format and is a PNG image.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the conditional statement to address the specific case when the image is in RGBA format and is a PNG image.

Here's the corrected `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode != 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.format != 'PNG' and image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In this corrected function, the conditional statements now check for the image format before making any conversion. This ensures that the correct conversion logic is applied based on the image format and mode.
