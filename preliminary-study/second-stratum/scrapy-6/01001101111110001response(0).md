The buggy function `convert_image` has a few issues:

1. The code to handle PNG images with RGBA mode is incorrect. It creates a new background, pastes the original image onto it, and then converts it to RGB. This is not the correct way to handle RGBA images, as it loses the alpha channel information.
2. The code to convert non-RGB images to RGB is also incorrect. It applies the conversion unconditionally, which is unnecessary and may lead to loss of color information in certain cases.

The error message from the test function indicates that the color values of the images are not as expected after conversion. This is likely due to the incorrect handling of RGBA images in the buggy function.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated to correctly handle RGBA images and convert non-RGB images to RGB only if necessary.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageOps
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Create a new image with white background and paste the original image onto it
        new_image = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        new_image.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        # Convert the new image to RGB keeping the alpha channel
        image = new_image.convert('RGBA')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        # Convert the image to RGB
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        # Create a copy of the image and resize it
        image = image.copy()
        image = ImageOps.exif_transpose(image)
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    # Save the image in JPEG format
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With these changes, the function now correctly handles RGBA images and converts non-RGB images to RGB only if necessary. This should resolve the issues encountered in the test function.
