1. The test case is trying to create a minimal RNN cell and test its functionality. The error message indicates that there is an assertion error in the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class, where it asserts that the length of `input_shape` should be equal to 2.

2. The potential error location is in the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class, where it asserts the length of `input_shape`.

3. The bug occurs because the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class is incorrectly assuming that `input_shape` will always have a length of 2.

4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class to handle input shapes with a different length.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    if len(input_shape) != 2:
        raise ValueError("Input shape should have a length of 2, but received input_shape: {}".format(input_shape))
    
    self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                  initializer='uniform',
                                  name='kernel')
    self.recurrent_kernel = self.add_weight(
        shape=(self.units, self.units),
        initializer='uniform',
        name='recurrent_kernel')
    self.built = True
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to ensure that `input_shape` has a length of 2. If it doesn't, a `ValueError` is raised with a descriptive error message.
