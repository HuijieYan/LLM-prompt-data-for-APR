The error occurs at the assertion `assert len(input_shape) == 2` within the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class. This assertion checks the length of the input shape to be 2, but the input_shape provided in the error message is (None, 5, 8).

The reason for this bug is that the shape of the input provided, (None, 5, 8), is a 3D tensor, while the `MinimalRNNCell` class is designed to work with a 2D tensor input. The test input `x = keras.Input((None, 5))` creates a 3D tensor due to which the assertion fails.

To fix this bug, the input shape parameter in the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class needs to be validated appropriately. If the cell is intended to work with 3D tensors, the `assert` statement should be modified accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `MinimalRNNCell` class with a modified assertion:

```python
class MinimalRNNCell(keras.layers.Layer):

    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        self.units = units
        self.state_size = units
        super(MinimalRNNCell, self).__init__(**kwargs)

    def build(self, input_shape):
        # no time axis in the input shape passed to RNN cells
        if len(input_shape) != 3:  # Check for 3D input shape
            raise ValueError("Input shape should be 3D tensor")
        
        self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                      initializer='uniform',
                                      name='kernel')
        self.recurrent_kernel = self.add_weight(
            shape=(self.units, self.units),
            initializer='uniform',
            name='recurrent_kernel')
        self.built = True

    # ... (other methods remain unchanged)
```

This modification ensures that the `build` method in the `MinimalRNNCell` class can handle 3D input tensors.
