The error in the provided function seems to be occurring due to the incorrect handling of the `input_shape` tuple. The function is expecting the `input_shape` to have a length of 2, but it is actually 3 in the failing test case, leading to an assertion error.

To fix this issue, the function needs to properly handle the shape of the input. It should accommodate cases where the input shape might have a length greater than 2, such as in the failing test case.

The corrected code for the `build` function is as follows:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        # Adjusting input_shape dimensions dynamically
        if len(input_shape) > 2:
            input_shape = input_shape[:-1] + (output_dim,)
        else:
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)
    
    self.built = True
```

In this corrected code, we dynamically adjust the dimensions of `input_shape` based on its length. If it has more than 2 dimensions, we modify it to replace the last dimension with the `output_dim`. Otherwise, we only consider the first dimension for modification.
