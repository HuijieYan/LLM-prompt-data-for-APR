The error is occurring when the test case is trying to check the input shape in the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell`. The error message indicates that the input shape has a length of 3 instead of the expected length of 2.

Upon reviewing the source code, it seems that the error stems from the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class. The input shape is expected to have a length of 2, but it is being assigned a value of `(input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)` in the `build` method of the function provided.

To fix this issue, the logic for updating the input shape should be modified to ensure that it remains a tuple with a length of 2.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    # no time axis in the input shape passed to RNN cells
    assert len(input_shape) == 2

    self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                  initializer='uniform',
                                  name='kernel')
    self.recurrent_kernel = self.add_weight(
        shape=(self.units, self.units),
        initializer='uniform',
        name='recurrent_kernel')
    self.built = True
```

By making this modification, the input shape will retain its expected structure and the error should be resolved.
