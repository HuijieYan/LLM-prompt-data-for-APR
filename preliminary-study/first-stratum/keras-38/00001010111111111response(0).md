The error occurs in the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class. The error message indicates that the length of the `input_shape` tuple is not as expected. This is likely due to the `input_shape` being modified incorrectly in the `build` method.

To fix the bug, the `build` method should handle the `input_shape` correctly to ensure it has the expected format.

Here's the corrected `build` method for the `MinimalRNNCell` class:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    # no time axis in the input shape passed to RNN cells
    if len(input_shape) != 3:
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[2])  # Assuming the time axis is the second element

    self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                  initializer='uniform',
                                  name='kernel')
    self.recurrent_kernel = self.add_weight(
        shape=(self.units, self.units),
        initializer='uniform',
        name='recurrent_kernel')
    self.built = True
```

In this corrected method, the `input_shape` is checked to ensure it matches the expected format, and if not, it is modified accordingly. Then, the weights are initialized based on the modified `input_shape`.

This should resolve the issue with the length of the `input_shape` tuple and ensure that it matches the expected format within the `build` method.
