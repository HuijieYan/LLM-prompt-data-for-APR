The buggy function is the `build` method within the `StackedRNNCells` class. The error message indicates that a `len(input_shape) == 2` assertion is failing within the `MinimalRNNCell` class, which implies that the input shape is not as expected.

The reason behind the bug is that the `build` method in the `StackedRNNCells` class is incorrectly modifying the `input_shape` variable within the loop, which leads to the subsequent assertion failure in the `MinimalRNNCell` class.

To fix this bug, the `input_shape` should not be modified within the loop. Instead, a separate variable should be used to store the modified shape. Additionally, it's important to handle the state size of each cell correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` function:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    modified_input_shape = input_shape  # Create a separate variable to store the modified shape
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(modified_input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell, 'state_size'):
            if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
                output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
            else:
                output_dim = cell.state_size
            modified_input_shape = (modified_input_shape[0], modified_input_shape[1], output_dim)  # Update the modified shape
    self.built = True
```

With these modifications, the input shape is no longer erroneously modified within the loop, and the `state_size` is correctly handled for each cell. This should resolve the bug and prevent the assertion failure in the `MinimalRNNCell` class.
