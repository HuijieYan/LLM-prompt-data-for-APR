The bug is located in the `build` function of the `StackedRNNCells` class. The error message indicates a failed assertion within the `MinimalRNNCell` build function, which is called within the `build` function of `StackedRNNCells`.

The bug occurs due to an incorrect assumption about the structure of the `input_shape` tuple. The assertion `assert len(input_shape) == 2` in the `MinimalRNNCell` build function expects `input_shape` to have a length of 2, which contradicts the actual shape passed during the test.

To fix the bug, the `input_shape` tuple must be manipulated correctly within the `build` function of `StackedRNNCells` before calling the `build` function of individual cells.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` function:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    output_dim = input_shape[-1]
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

In this corrected code, we initialize `output_dim` with the last element of `input_shape` before iterating through the cells. This ensures that the `output_dim` is correctly updated as the loop progresses.
