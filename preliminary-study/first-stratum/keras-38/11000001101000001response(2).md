The error seems to be occurring in the `build` method of the `StackedRNNCells` class. The issue appears to be related to handling the `input_shape` and `cell` properties.

The bug is occurring because the `build` method within the `StackedRNNCells` class is not correctly processing the input shapes and cells. It seems to be assuming properties of the `cell` without thoroughly checking their type.

To fix the bug, the `build` method should iterate through the cells and handle each cell uniformly without assuming their type. Additionally, it should handle the case when the `state_size` property may not be iterable.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` method:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell, 'state_size'):
            if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
                output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
            else:
                output_dim = cell.state_size
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

In this corrected code, we first check if the `cell` is an instance of `Layer`, and if so, we call its `build` method. Then, we check if the `state_size` attribute exists for the current `cell`. If it does, we handle it according to its type, similarly to the original implementation. Finally, we set `self.built` to `True`.

This corrected code addresses the issues by handling the input shapes and cells properly and ensuring that the `build` method processes the cells uniformly.
