Potential Error Location: The problem seems to be occurring in the build function of the StackedRNNCells class.

Reason for the Bug: The issue seems to be that the build method in the StackedRNNCells class is defined multiple times, and the final one contains a logical error, causing the function to fail.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug: 
1. Remove the redundant build methods in the StackedRNNCells class and keep only one build method.
2. Ensure that the logic within the build method is correct and traverses through the cells to build them based on input_shape.

Corrected Code for the build method in the StackedRNNCells class:
```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell, 'state_size'):
            if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
                output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
            else:
                output_dim = cell.state_size
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
