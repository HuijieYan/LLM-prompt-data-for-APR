1. The test case is testing a MinimalRNNCell layer and a recurrent RNN model. The error message indicates that the input shape passed to the RNN cell is causing an assertion error because the length of the input shape is not equal to 2.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the build method where the input_shape is being modified.

3. The bug occurs because the input_shape modification logic within the build method is not handling the time axis correctly. It is assuming the input shape always has a time axis, which is not true for the RNN cells.

4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling the input_shape in the build method of the RNN cell. We need to account for the absence of a time axis in the input shape.

5. Here's the corrected code for the build method of the RNN cell:

```python
    def build(self, input_shape):
        # no time axis in the input shape passed to RNN cells
        assert len(input_shape) == 3  # input_shape should have 3 dimensions (batch size, time steps, input features)

        for cell in self.cells:
            if hasattr(cell, 'build'):
                cell.build(input_shape)
            if hasattr(cell, 'state_size') and hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
                output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
            else:
                output_dim = cell.state_size
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[2], output_dim)  # Removing the time axis and updating input_shape

        self.built = True
```

In the corrected code, we first assert that the length of the input_shape is 3 to ensure it has the expected dimensions. Then, we iterate through the cells and update the input_shape by removing the time axis and replacing it with the output dimension of each cell. Additionally, we check if the cell has a build method before calling it to avoid potential errors.
