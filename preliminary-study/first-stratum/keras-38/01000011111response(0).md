1. The test case is trying to create a MinimalRNNCell with 32 units and then stack multiple instances of the cell. This is resulting in an error due to an assertion failure in the build method of the MinimalRNNCell class.

2. The potential error location is the build method within the MinimalRNNCell class.

3. The bug occurs because the build method of the MinimalRNNCell is checking for the length of the input_shape to be equal to 2. However, when the MinimalRNNCell is stacked, the input_shape has a length of 3, resulting in the assertion failure.

4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the build method in a way that it can handle input_shape of length 3 when the cell is stacked.

5. Here's the corrected code for the build method within the MinimalRNNCell class:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    # no time axis in the input shape passed to RNN cells
    assert len(input_shape) == 3  # We modify this assertion to check for length 3

    # Rest of the method remains unchanged
    self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                  initializer='uniform',
                                  name='kernel')
    self.recurrent_kernel = self.add_weight(
        shape=(self.units, self.units),
        initializer='uniform',
        name='recurrent_kernel')
    self.built = True
```

By modifying the assertion to check for length 3 and adding a check for the input_shape to be a list when stacked, we can fix the bug in the build method of the MinimalRNNCell class.
