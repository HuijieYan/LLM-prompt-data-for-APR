The bug occurs in the `build` method of the `StackedRNNCells` class. The loop inside the `build` method iterates through each cell in `self.cells`, where it attempts to call the `build` method of each cell and then extracts the `state_size` attribute from the cell. The issue is that the `state_size` attribute is being accessed incorrectly.

The error message from the test function is related to an assertion that fails, suggesting that the number of cells is not being handled properly, possibly due to incorrect processing of the `state_size` attribute.

To fix the bug, the `state_size` attribute should be accessed as an attribute of the cell itself, and the loop should correctly handle the case where `state_size` is a list. Additionally, the `input_shape` should be updated with the correct output dimension for each cell.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` method:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell, 'state_size'):
            if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
                output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
            else:
                output_dim = cell.state_size
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

In the corrected code:
- The `state_size` attribute is accessed directly from the `cell`.
- The `if` condition checks if the `cell` has the `state_size` attribute before attempting to access it.
- The `input_shape` is updated correctly based on the `output_dim` of each cell.
