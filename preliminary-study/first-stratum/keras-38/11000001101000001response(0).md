The bug occurs in the `build` function of the `StackedRNNCells` class. The purpose of this function seems to be to build each cell's state and output shape based on the `input_shape` parameter.

The issue arises from the `build` function iterating over `self.cells` and checking whether each cell is an instance of `Layer`. If so, it tries to build this cell using the `input_shape`. However, the problem is that it doesn't handle the case where `cell` is not an instance of `Layer`. As a result, it attempts to access `cell.state_size` without ensuring that `state_size` exists, leading to a potential AttributeError.

To fix this issue:
1. We need to add a check to ensure that `cell` has the attribute `state_size` before trying to access it.
2. If `cell.state_size` doesn't exist, we can provide a default value or raise an error to indicate that the state size is invalid.

Here's the corrected `build` function:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell, 'state_size'):
            if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
                output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
            else:
                output_dim = cell.state_size
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
        else:
            raise AttributeError("Cell does not have valid state_size attribute")
    self.built = True
```

This corrected function ensures that the `cell` has the `state_size` attribute before accessing it. If it doesn't exist, the function will raise an AttributeError indicating that the cell does not have a valid `state_size` attribute.
