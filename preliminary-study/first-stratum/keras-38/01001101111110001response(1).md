The error message states that the assertion `assert 3 == 2` failed, indicating that the expected value is not equal to the actual value. This assertion failure points to the fact that the function under test is not functioning as expected.

Potential error location: The for loop inside the `build` function is likely causing the issue as it is iterating over the `self.cells` list and performing some operations, but it is not handling the iteration or output correctly.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. The loop is not handling the attributes of the cell objects properly.
2. When accessing `cell.state_size`, it is not being checked for the attribute's existence before accessing its length.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the loop iterates over each cell properly and handles any attributes that are not available or have unexpected values.
2. Check if the `state_size` attribute exists for each cell before attempting to access its length.
3. Handle the output of the loop correctly using the output_dim variable.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` function:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell, 'state_size'):
            if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
                output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
            else:
                output_dim = cell.state_size
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
