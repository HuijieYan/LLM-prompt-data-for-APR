The bug is likely in the `build` method of the `StackedRNNCells` class. The error message indicates an assertion error in the test function `test_minimal_rnn_cell_layer`.

The issue in the `build` method is likely due to the `input_shape` modification. The `self.cells` attribute is iterated through, and the `input_shape` is modified based on the `state_size` of the cells. However, the logic of modifying `input_shape` seems flawed.

To fix the bug, the `input_shape` should not be modified in the iteration loop. Instead, a separate variable should be used to store the modified `input_shape` for each cell and then updated accordingly. Additionally, some conditions in the loop might need to be adjusted based on the logic of the code.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` method:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    modified_input_shape = input_shape
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(modified_input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        modified_input_shape = (modified_input_shape[0], modified_input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
