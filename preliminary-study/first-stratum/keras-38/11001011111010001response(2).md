The problem occurs in the `build` method of the `StackedRNNCells` class. The error is likely due to incorrect handling of the `cell.state_size` attribute.

Upon reviewing the code, it seems that there is an issue with the line `if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):`. This line tries to check if the `state_size` attribute of the `cell` has a length, but the usage of `hasattr` is incorrect.

To fix this issue, we can modify the code to use `isinstance` to check if `cell.state_size` is a list or tuple, indicating that it has a length.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` method:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if isinstance(cell.state_size, (list, tuple)):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

By making this change, we ensure that we correctly check if the `state_size` attribute of the `cell` has a length, and then proceed accordingly.
