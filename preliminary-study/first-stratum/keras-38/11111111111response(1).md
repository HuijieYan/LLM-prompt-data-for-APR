1. The test case is attempting to build a stacked RNN using the `MinimalRNNCell` class and `RNN` layers, with a test to ensure that the built RNN can correctly process input data. The error message indicates that the built RNN is not handling the input shape correctly, as the length of the input shape is not as expected.

2. The potential error location is in the `build` method of the `StackedRNNCells` class, specifically within the for loop where it iterates over the cells.

3. The error occurs because the `build` method of `StackedRNNCells` is incorrectly updating the `input_shape` based on the `state_size` of the cells. This leads to a mismatch in the expected input shape compared to the actual input shape later in the code.

4. To fix the bug, the `build` method should calculate the output shape for each cell and correctly update the `input_shape` to reflect these changes. It should also consider the dimensionality of the input shape that corresponds to the time axis when updating the input shape.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `build` method of the `StackedRNNCells` class:

```python
# corrected build method for StackedRNNCells
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)  # updating the input shape based on output_dim
    self.built = True
```

By correctly updating the `input_shape` considering the time axis and output dimension, this corrected method addresses the issues around input shape mismatch and the `state_size` of the cells.
