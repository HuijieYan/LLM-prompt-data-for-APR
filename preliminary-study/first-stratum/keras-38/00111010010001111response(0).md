The error occurs in the `build` method of the `StackedRNNCells` class. The issue arises from the logic used to handle the `cell.state_size` attribute. The `build` method is trying to access `cell.state_size` without checking if it exists, which causes an error when the attribute is not present.

To fix this issue, the following changes can be made to the `build` method:

1. Check if the `cell` has the `state_size` attribute using the `hasattr` function before accessing it.
2. Update the input shape based on the `state_size` of the cell.

Here's the corrected `build` method:

```python
# Corrected build method
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell, 'state_size'):
            if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
                output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
            else:
                output_dim = cell.state_size
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
