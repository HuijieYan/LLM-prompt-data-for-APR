## Correction

The error occurs when the function `build` is being called. The error message `assert len(input_shape) == 2` indicates that the input_shape being passed to the `MinimalRNNCell` object is not as expected. It should be in the format `(None, features)`.

To fix the bug, the input_shape must be updated as per the requirements of the `MinimalRNNCell` object. Additionally, the logic for updating `input_shape` and checking the `cell.state_size` also needs to be reviewed.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` function:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
            if hasattr(cell, 'state_size') and hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
                output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
            else:
                output_dim = cell.state_size
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

In the corrected code:
1. We iterate through each cell in `self.cells`.
2. We build each cell if it is an instance of `Layer`.
3. We update the `output_dim` based on the `state_size` of the cell.
4. We update the `input_shape` based on the `output_dim`.
5. Finally, we set `self.built` to `True` after the loop.

This should address the issues and prevent the error from occurring.
