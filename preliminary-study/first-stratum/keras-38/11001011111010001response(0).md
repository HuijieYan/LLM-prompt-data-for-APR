The error in the code is likely due to the incorrect implementation of the `build` function. It seems that the `build` function may not be handling the `cells` attribute and its elements correctly.

The `build` function iterates through the `cells` attribute and attempts to build each cell. However, it should handle the case where `cell.state_size` may be a scalar or an array-like object.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to check if `cell.state_size` is an iterable object. If it is, then take the first element as the `output_dim`; otherwise, use `cell.state_size` directly as `output_dim`. Then, update the `input_shape` based on the `output_dim` obtained.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` function:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__') and not isinstance(cell.state_size, int):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]  # Take the first element of state_size
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

This revised implementation checks the type of `cell.state_size` and only takes the first element if it is iterable and not a single integer value. This should address the bug and allow the function to function as intended.
