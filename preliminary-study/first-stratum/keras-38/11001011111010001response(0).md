The issue with the given code is that the `state_size` of the cell is being accessed incorrectly. The code is checking if the `cell.state_size` has a `__len__` attribute, which is incorrect.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `state_size` property of the cell is assumed to be a callable method, when in fact it is likely an integer value representing the state size.

To fix the bug:
1. Update the code to directly access the `state_size` property of the cell without checking for the `__len__` attribute.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` function:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

By making this change, the code will directly access the `state_size` property of the cell to determine the output dimension, allowing the function to handle the state sizes correctly.
