1. The test case (test_minimal_rnn_cell_layer) is creating a MinimalRNNCell and using it in a recurrent RNN layer. The error message indicates that the input_shape has a length of 3, but the build method of MinimalRNNCell is expecting it to have a length of 2, leading to an assertion error.

2. The potential error location is within the build method of the MinimalRNNCell class, specifically in the assertion `assert len(input_shape) == 2`.

3. The error occurred because when the RNN layer is called with an input, it tries to build the underlying MinimalRNNCell, passing the input shape to its build method. However, the input shape includes a time axis, making it three-dimensional, and this conflicts with the assertion in the build method.

4. The bug can be fixed by modifying the assertion in the build method to account for the time axis and allowing for a three-dimensional input shape. Additionally, the method `self.state_size()` in the `StackedRNNCells` class should correctly handle checking the length of the state size attribute in the cell.

5. Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class StackedRNNCells(Layer):
    # class signature containing the buggy function
    def __init__(self, cells):
        super(StackedRNNCells, self).__init__()
        self.cells = cells

    def state_size(self):
        # Calculate the state size based on the cells' state sizes
        state_sizes = [cell.state_size for cell in self.cells]
        return nest.flatten(state_sizes)

    def build(self, input_shape):
        for cell in self.cells:
            if isinstance(cell, Layer):
                cell.build(input_shape)
            if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
                output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
            else:
                output_dim = cell.state_size
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
        self.built = True
```
