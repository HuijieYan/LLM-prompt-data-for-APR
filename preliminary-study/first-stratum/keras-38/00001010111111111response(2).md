The error occurs in the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class. The `build` method is expecting the input shape to have a length of 2, but in the test case, the input shape has a length of 3, leading to an assertion error.

The reason for this bug is that the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class assumes a specific shape for the input, which may not always be the case.

To fix this bug, the `build` method should be modified to handle input shapes with a length other than 2. This could be achieved by dynamically adjusting the input shape without assuming a fixed length.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class:

```python
class MinimalRNNCell(keras.layers.Layer):
    # ... other methods ...

    def build(self, input_shape):
        if len(input_shape) != 2:
            # Adjust input shape dynamically
            if len(input_shape) > 3:
                input_shape = input_shape[-2:]
            else:
                raise ValueError("Input shape must have a length of 2 or greater")

        self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                      initializer='uniform',
                                      name='kernel')
        self.recurrent_kernel = self.add_weight(
            shape=(self.units, self.units),
            initializer='uniform',
            name='recurrent_kernel')
        self.built = True
```

In this corrected code, the input shape is checked, and if its length is not 2, it is adjusted as needed. By making this change, the `build` method should be able to handle input shapes with different lengths, fixing the bug encountered in the test case.
