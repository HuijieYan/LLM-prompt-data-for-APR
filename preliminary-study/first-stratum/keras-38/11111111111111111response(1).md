The bug seems to be within the `MinimalRNNCell` class's `build` method. The error message indicates that the input shape has a length of 3, while the code expects it to be 2.

The reason for this bug is that the input shape used to build the layer is expected to have only two dimensions, but the actual input shape has three dimensions. This could be due to a mismatch between the expected input shape and the provided input data.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to ensure that the input shape used to build the layer matches the expected shape. This may involve modifying the input data or adjusting the expected input shape within the `MinimalRNNCell` class.

Below is the corrected code for the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    if len(input_shape) != 3:
        raise ValueError("Input shape should have 3 dimensions")
    
    self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                  initializer='uniform',
                                  name='kernel')
    self.recurrent_kernel = self.add_weight(
        shape=(self.units, self.units),
        initializer='uniform',
        name='recurrent_kernel')
    self.built = True
```

By properly validating the input shape and making necessary adjustments, the bug can be fixed.
