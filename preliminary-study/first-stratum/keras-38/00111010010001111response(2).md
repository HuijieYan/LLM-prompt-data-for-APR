Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the `build` method of the `StackedRNNCells` class, specifically in the loop that iterates over the cells.

Reasons for the bug: 
1. The `output_dim` variable is being overwritten in each iteration of the loop, potentially leading to incorrect values.
2. The code does not handle the case when `cell.state_size` is not iterable.

Possible approach to fix the bug:
1. Initialize an empty list to store the `output_dim` values for each cell.
2. Append the `output_dim` value to the list for each cell.
3. Use the maximum value from the list as the final `output_dim` to ensure that it can accommodate all cell state sizes.

Corrected code:
```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    output_dims = []
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dims.append(cell.state_size[0])
        else:
            output_dims.append(cell.state_size)
    output_dim = max(output_dims)
    input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
