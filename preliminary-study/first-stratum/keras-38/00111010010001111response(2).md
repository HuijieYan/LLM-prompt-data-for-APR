The issue with the `build` method is that the `cells` variable is not defined within the class, leading to an error when trying to loop through `self.cells`.

The `build` method should access the `cells` attribute of the class, however, the code snippet provided does not show the initialization of the `cells` attribute within the class. Without this initialization, the `build` method will raise a `RuntimeError` due to `self.cells` being undefined.

To fix this issue, the `cells` attribute should be initialized in the `__init__` method of the `StackedRNNCells` class, so that it can be accessed by the other methods within the class.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
class StackedRNNCells(Layer):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def __init__(self, cells):
        super(StackedRNNCells, self).__init__()
        self.cells = cells

    def state_size(self):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass
    
    def build(self, input_shape):
        for cell in self.cells:
            if isinstance(cell, Layer):
                cell.build(input_shape)
            if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
                output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
            else:
                output_dim = cell.state_size
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
        self.built = True
```

In this correction, the `cells` attribute is initialized through the `__init__` method. It is then accessed within the `build` method.
