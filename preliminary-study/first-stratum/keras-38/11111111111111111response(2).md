The error occurs in the `build` method of the `StackedRNNCells` class in the `recurrent.py` file. The error message indicates that the input_shape has a length of 3 instead of the expected length of 2, leading to an assertion error.

The bug occurs because the `input_shape` provided to the `build` method has a length of 3, which is not handled correctly in the logic of the function. The `input_shape` is modified within the function, causing it to have a length of 3 instead of 2, leading to the assertion error.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `input_shape` is handled properly and that its length remains as expected. Additionally, we should check for the length of `input_shape` and modify it accordingly without causing assertion errors.

Below is the corrected code for the `build` method:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        if isinstance(input_shape, list):
            input_shape = input_shape[0]  # Use the first element if input_shape is a list
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to see if the `input_shape` is a list, and if it is, we use the first element of the list. This adjustment ensures that the `input_shape` is handled correctly, and its length remains as expected.
