The error occurs in the `MinimalRNNCell` class, specifically in the `build` method when the input shape assertion fails. This happens because the input shape has the form (None, 5, 8) which has a length of 3, and the assertion expects a length of 2.

This error is likely due to the design of the RNN cell and how the input shape is being handled. To fix this bug, the input shape should be adjusted to match the expected shape for the RNN cell.

Here's the corrected code for the `MinimalRNNCell` class:

```python
class MinimalRNNCell(keras.layers.Layer):

    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        self.units = units
        self.state_size = units
        super(MinimalRNNCell, self).__init__(**kwargs)

    def build(self, input_shape):
        output_dim = self.units  # Adjust input shape to match the expected shape for the RNN cell
        self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                      initializer='uniform',
                                      name='kernel')
        self.recurrent_kernel = self.add_weight(
            shape=(self.units, self.units),
            initializer='uniform',
            name='recurrent_kernel')
        self.state_size = [input_shape[0], output_dim]  # Update the state size based on the adjusted input shape
        self.built = True

    # ... (other methods remain unchanged) ...
```

By adjusting the input shape and updating the state size accordingly, the bug in the `MinimalRNNCell` class should be fixed.
