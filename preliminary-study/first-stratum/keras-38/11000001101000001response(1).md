The potential error in the provided buggy function is in the `build` method, where the input_shape is being modified in each iteration of the loop through the cells.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the input_shape is being modified in each iteration of the loop, which can lead to unexpected behavior when building the layers.

To fix the bug, the input_shape should be updated based on the state_size of the current cell. Instead of modifying the input_shape directly, a new variable should be used to store the updated input_shape in each iteration.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` method:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    current_input_shape = input_shape
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(current_input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        current_input_shape = (current_input_shape[0], current_input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

In this corrected code, a new variable `current_input_shape` is used to store the updated input_shape, while the original `input_shape` remains unchanged. This ensures that the input_shape is updated based on the state_size of each cell without affecting the original input_shape.
