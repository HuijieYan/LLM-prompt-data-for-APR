The error likely occurs in the `build` function of the `StackedRNNCells` class. The `build` function loops through the cells and tries to access `state_size` attribute. However, if the `cell` object doesn't have a `state_size` attribute, the function will crash.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code does not check if the `cell` object has a `state_size` attribute before attempting to access it.

To fix the bug, the code needs to be modified to include a check for the existence of the `state_size` attribute before accessing it.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` function:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell, 'state_size'):
            if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
                output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
            else:
                output_dim = cell.state_size
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

In the fixed code, `hasattr(cell, 'state_size')` is used to check if the `state_size` attribute exists before attempting to access it. This avoids the crash that occurred in the original buggy code.
