The buggy function is `request_httprepr`, and it seems to be crashing because it is trying to parse a non-HTTP request. The function assumes that the request object passed to it is an HTTP request, but in the test case, it is being called with a file request.

To fix this bug, the function should first check if the request is an HTTP request before processing it. If it's not an HTTP request, it should handle it differently or raise an error to indicate that it cannot process non-HTTP requests.

Here is the corrected code for the function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    if not request.url.startswith('http'):
        raise ValueError("Non-HTTP requests are not supported by this function")
    
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = request.method.encode('utf-8') + b" " + path.encode('utf-8') + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + parsed.hostname.encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string().encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In this corrected function, the `request.url` is checked to see if it starts with "http", indicating it is an HTTP request. If it is not an HTTP request, a `ValueError` is raised. Otherwise, the function continues with processing the HTTP request as before. Additionally, the string encoding/decoding is used consistently.
