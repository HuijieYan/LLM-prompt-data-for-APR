The buggy function `request_httprepr` is supposed to generate an HTTP representation of the request. However, it does not handle non-HTTP requests properly. 

The error occurs because the function assumes the request is an HTTP request, and it tries to construct an HTTP representation even if the request is not HTTP. This causes an issue when the request is not HTTP.

To fix the bug, we can check if the request is an HTTP request before constructing the HTTP representation. If it is not an HTTP request, we can simply return an empty string or handle it in a different way.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    if not request.url.startswith('http://') and not request.url.startswith('https://'):
        return b""  # return empty bytes if not an HTTP request

    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this correction, the function checks if the request is an HTTP request before attempting to construct the HTTP representation. If it is not an HTTP request, the function simply returns an empty byte string.
