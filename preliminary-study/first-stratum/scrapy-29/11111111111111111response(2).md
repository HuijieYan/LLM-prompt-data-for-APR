The error is occurring in the `request_httprepr` function, specifically when trying to access `parsed.hostname` to concatenate it with a byte string. The error message indicates that `parsed.hostname` is of type NoneType, causing the `to_bytes` function to raise a TypeError since it expects either a unicode, str, or bytes object.

The reason behind this bug is that the `parsed` object returned by `urlparse_cached(request)` does not always have the `hostname` attribute. This can happen when the URL scheme is not HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP.

To fix this bug, we need to handle cases where `parsed` does not have the `hostname` attribute by providing a default value.

Here's the corrected `request_httprepr` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = request.method.encode('utf-8') + b" " + path.encode('utf-8') + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + parsed.hostname.encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In this corrected function:
- We have imported `urlparse` directly from `urllib.parse` and removed the `urlparse_cached` call, as it's not a standard function.
- We use `.encode('utf-8')` to convert strings to bytes.
- We check if `parsed.hostname` exists before using it to prevent the AttributeError.
- If `parsed.hostname` exists, we encode it to bytes and concatenate it with the byte string.

With these changes, the function should handle non-HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP URL schemes properly and produce the expected raw HTTP representation without causing any errors.
