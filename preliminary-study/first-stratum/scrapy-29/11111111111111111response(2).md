The error occurs in the `to_bytes` function that is being called on `parsed.hostname` in the `request_httprepr` function. The error message indicates that the `to_bytes` function is receiving a `NoneType` object, which means that `parsed.hostname` is evaluating to `None`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `urlparse_cached` function is not correctly parsing the input URL. This can happen when the URL scheme is not recognized, or when there is some other issue with the URL parsing.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` and provide a default value for the host in the HTTP request.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '') + (parsed.path or '/',) + parsed[3:])
    s = request.method.encode('utf-8') + b" " + path.encode('utf-8') + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    host = parsed.hostname if parsed.hostname else b"localhost"
    s += b"Host: " + host.encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected code, the `urlparse_cached` function is replaced with the standard `urlparse` function. A default value for the host is provided if `parsed.hostname` is `None`. The URL parsing and generation of the HTTP request has been updated to handle various cases.
