1. The test case is trying to call the `request_httprepr` function with a URL that is not an HTTP request (`file:///tmp/foo.txt`). The error message indicates that the `to_bytes` function is receiving a `NoneType` object, which is causing a `TypeError`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"`.

3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `parsed.hostname` might be `None` for non-HTTP requests, and the `to_bytes` function is not handling the `None` value correctly.

4. One possible approach for fixing the bug is to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` before trying to convert it to bytes. This can be done by adding a condition to check if `parsed.hostname` is not `None` before converting it to bytes.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In this corrected code, the `if parsed.hostname:` condition checks if `parsed.hostname` is not `None` before trying to convert it to bytes. If the `parsed.hostname` is not `None`, it is converted to bytes and added to the string to be returned.
