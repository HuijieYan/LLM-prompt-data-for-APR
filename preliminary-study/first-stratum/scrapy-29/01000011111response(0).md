1. The test case is trying to call the `request_httprepr` function with a `file` URL, which is causing the error. The error message indicates that the `to_bytes` function is receiving a `NoneType` instead of the expected `unicode`, `str`, or `bytes` object.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the `parsed.hostname` attribute when constructing the `Host` header in the HTTP request.

3. The error is occurring because the `file` URL does not have a `hostname` attribute, which is causing `parsed.hostname` to be `None`. This is causing the `to_bytes` function to raise a `TypeError` since it's expecting a valid string type.

4. One possible approach for fixing the bug is to check if `parsed.hostname` is `None` before trying to concatenate it with the `b"Host: "` prefix. If it's `None`, you can handle it accordingly, such as using the `file` URL's path as the host or skipping the `Host` header altogether for non-HTTP requests.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse
import six

def request_httprepr(request):
    
    parsed = urlparse(request.url) # updated to use urlparse instead of urlparse_cached
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    if parsed.scheme == 'http' or parsed.scheme == 'https':
        if parsed.hostname: # Check if hostname is not None
            s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
        else:
            # Handle non-HTTP requests
            # You can skip the Host header or use the path as the host
            s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.path) + b"\r\n"
        if request.headers:
            s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
