The error occurs in the `to_bytes` function, which is called with `parsed.hostname` as an argument. The error message indicates that `parsed.hostname` is of type `NoneType`, which is not compatible with the `to_bytes` function.

This bug is occurring because `parsed.hostname` is not being correctly extracted from the URL. This is causing it to be `None` when it should be the hostname of the URL.

To fix this bug, the `parsed.hostname` should be extracted correctly from the URL using the `urlparse_cached` function, or by directly accessing the `parsed.netloc` after parsing the URL.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
from six.moves.urllib.parse import urlparse_cached, urlunparse
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes

def request_httprepr(request):
    
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    hostname = parsed.netloc.split(':')[0]  # Extracting hostname from the netloc
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(hostname) + b"\r\n"  # Using the extracted hostname
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
This code modifies the way `parsed.hostname` is being extracted, ensuring that it is not `None` when used in the `to_bytes` function.
