The issue with the `request_httprepr` function is that it assumes the request object always contains HTTP-related information, such as method, headers, and body. However, the input request might not always be an HTTP request, leading to the function crashing.

To fix this issue, we can modify the function to handle non-HTTP requests gracefully and ensure that it does not crash.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    if not request.method:
        raise ValueError("HTTP method is not provided in the request")
        
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = parsed.path or '/'
    s = request.method + " " + path + " HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += "Host: " + parsed.hostname + "\r\n"
        
    if request.headers:
        s += "\r\n".join([f"{k}: {v}" for k,v in request.headers.items()]) + "\r\n"
        
    if request.body:
        s += "\r\n" + request.body.decode('utf-8')
    
    return s.encode('utf-8')
```

In this corrected code, we first check if the request method is provided. If not, we raise a ValueError. Then, we parse the URL using `urlparse` and construct the request string accordingly, handling non-HTTP requests gracefully.

This should fix the bug in the `request_httprepr` function and ensure that it can handle non-HTTP requests without crashing.
