The issue with the provided function is that it is designed to handle HTTP requests, but the test case is passing in a non-HTTP request (file and ftp). This is causing the function to crash as it is not able to handle non-HTTP requests.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `request_httprepr` function to handle non-HTTP requests as well. We can do this by checking the scheme of the request and only constructing the HTTP representation if the scheme is HTTP.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
from scrapy.http.request import Request
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes

def request_httprepr(request):
    if request.scheme.lower() not in ['http', 'https']:
        return b""  # return empty bytes for non-HTTP requests
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this modification, the function will now return an empty bytes object for non-HTTP requests, preventing it from crashing when encountering non-HTTP requests.
