The error message indicates that there is a problem with the `to_bytes` function, specifically with the `text` parameter being of type `NoneType`. The `to_bytes` function should receive a unicode, str, or bytes object, but it is receiving a NoneType instead. This is likely due to an issue with the `parsed.hostname` value being None.

To fix this issue, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is None by providing a default value. This can be achieved by using the `or` operator to provide a default value. In this case, we can replace `to_bytes(parsed.hostname)` with `to_bytes(parsed.hostname or '')`. This ensures that if `parsed.hostname` is None, an empty string will be used instead.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """
    Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """

    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname or '') + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this fix, the `parsed.hostname` value being None will not cause the `to_bytes` function to raise a TypeError, and the function should work as expected.
