The bug in the provided function is that it assumes the request is an HTTP request, but it does not handle non-HTTP requests such as "file" or "ftp".

The error occurs because the function does not check if the request is an HTTP request before processing it. This causes the function to crash when it encounters a non-HTTP request.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle non-HTTP requests gracefully. We can check the scheme of the URL in the request and only process it if it is "http" or "https". If the scheme is "file" or "ftp", we can return a default representation without processing the other parts of the request.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse
from scrapy.http import Request
from scrapy.utils.request import to_bytes

def request_httprepr(request):
    if request.url.startswith('http') or request.url.startswith('https'):
        parsed = urlparse(request)
        path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
        s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
        if request.headers:
            s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
        s += b"\r\n"
        s += request.body
        return s
    else:
        return b"Non-HTTP request"
```

This corrected function checks the request's URL scheme and only processes it if it's an HTTP or HTTPS request. If the request is a file or ftp request, it returns a default representation without processing the other parts of the request.
