The error "TypeError: to_bytes must receive a unicode, str or bytes object, got NoneType" suggests that the 'parsed' variable might not be getting the expected value, specifically the 'parsed.hostname' may be None.

The potential error location within the function is the line:
s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that parsed.hostname might be None, which causes the to_bytes method to raise a TypeError.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to check if parsed.hostname is None, and if so, provide a default value. Additionally, the function should handle the case when the parsed.path is None.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from twisted.web.client import _parse

def request_httprepr(request):
    """
    Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """

    parsed = _parse(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    host = parsed.hostname if parsed.hostname else b"localhost"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(host) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
