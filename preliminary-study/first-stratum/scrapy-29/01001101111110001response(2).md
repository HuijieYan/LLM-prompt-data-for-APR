The error occurs at the line `s += to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"` because `parsed.hostname` is None, and `to_bytes` function expects a unicode, str, or bytes object, but it received a NoneType.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is None before using it in the `to_bytes` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes
from scrapy.http.request import Request
from scrapy.http.headers import Headers
from urllib.parse import urlparse as urlparse_cached, urlunparse, ParseResult

def request_httprepr(request):
    """
    Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """

    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    host = to_bytes(parsed.hostname) if parsed.hostname else b''
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + host + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"

    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this correction, the function handles the case where `parsed.hostname` is None and now it won't throw a `TypeError` when `parsed.hostname` is None.
