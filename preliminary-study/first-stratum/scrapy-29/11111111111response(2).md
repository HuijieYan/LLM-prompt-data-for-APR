1. The test case is attempting to call the `request_httprepr` function with a `file:///` URL and a `ftp://` URL, which are non-HTTP requests. The error message indicates that the function is failing because it is trying to concatenate a string with `None`, which suggests that the `parsed.hostname` value is `None`.

2. The potential error location is the line where `parsed.hostname` is being used in the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
```

3. The reason for the error is that the `parsed.hostname` value is `None`, and the `to_bytes` function is being called with this `None` value, resulting in a `TypeError`.

4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` might be `None` and ensure that the `to_bytes` function is called with a valid value.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes
from scrapy.http.request.common import urlparse_cached, urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):

    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    else:
        s += b"Host: " + b"\r\n"  # If hostname is None, add an empty host header
        
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to ensure that `parsed.hostname` is not `None` before using it in the `request_httprepr` function. If it is `None`, we add an empty host header instead. This modification fixes the bug by handling the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None`.
