The error message "TypeError: to_bytes must receive a unicode, str or bytes object, got NoneType" suggests that there is a NoneType being passed to the to_bytes function. This likely occurs when the parsed URL does not contain a hostname, which results in a NoneType being passed to the to_bytes function.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the parsed URL contains a hostname before using it. If the hostname is None, we should provide a default value.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse
from twisted.web.client import Request

def request_httprepr(request):
    """
    Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """

    parsed = urlparse(request.url)  # Use urlparse instead of urlparse_cached

    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))

    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    # Check if parsed URL contains a hostname before using it
    hostname = parsed.hostname if parsed.hostname else b"default_hostname"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(hostname) + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected code:
- We use urlparse to parse the URL instead of urlparse_cached.
- We check if the parsed URL contains a hostname and provide a default value if it's None.
- We handle other parts of the code according to their expected types as mentioned in the Expected case.
