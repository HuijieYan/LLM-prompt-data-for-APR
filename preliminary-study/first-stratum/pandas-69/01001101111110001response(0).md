The error message "ValueError: At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers" indicates that there is a type mismatch between the index and the indexer used in the At based indexing operations.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the validation process that checks the type of the index and the type of the indexer. Based on the error message, the bug appears to be related to the mismatch between integer and non-integer types.

The bug occurs because the function is not handling the case where the index is non-integer and the indexer is an integer properly. This causes a ValueError to be raised, leading to the failed test.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the _convert_key method to properly handle the case when the index is non-integer and the indexer is an integer. We can achieve this by explicitly checking the types of the index and the indexer, and then raising an appropriate error or casting the indexer to the correct type.

Here is the corrected code for the _convert_key method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers")
        else:
            if not isinstance(i, pd.Int64Index):
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers")

    return key
```

In the corrected code, we check the type of the index and the indexer explicitly and raise the appropriate ValueErrors if the types do not match. This should resolve the type mismatch issue and fix the bug.
