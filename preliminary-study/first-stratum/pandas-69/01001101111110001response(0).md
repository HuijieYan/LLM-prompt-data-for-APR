The error message "ValueError: At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers" indicates that the issue is with the function `_convert_key`. It seems like the function is not handling non-integer indexes properly, leading to the ValueError.

The bug occurs because the function is not checking whether the index is of a non-integer type and is allowing non-integer values to be passed to it. This results in the ValueError when non-integer indexers are used on non-integer indexes.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_convert_key` function to explicitly check for non-integer indexes and ensure that only non-integer indexers are allowed for non-integer indexes.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

By making these changes, the `_convert_key` function will now properly handle non-integer indexes and indexers, preventing the ValueError from occurring as observed in the test cases.
