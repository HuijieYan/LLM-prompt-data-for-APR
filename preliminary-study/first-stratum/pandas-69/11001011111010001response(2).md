The error message "ValueError: At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers" occurs because the function `_convert_key` is checking if the index is always an integer type, and if so, it expects the key to be an integer as well. However, when dealing with datetime or timedelta indexes, the key is not necessarily going to be an integer, leading to the ValueError being triggered.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `_convert_key` function to account for different types of indexes. We can remove the check for integer key and index and replace it with a more generic check that takes into account different index types.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if is_integer(i):
                if not ax.holds_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At-based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if ax.holds_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At-based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                    )
                
    return key
```

With this corrected code, the function will now properly handle different types of indexes and keys, and the ValueError should no longer occur in the test cases provided.
