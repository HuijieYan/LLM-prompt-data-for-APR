The error occurred in the `_convert_key` method of the `_AtIndexer` class. The method is failing to handle the case where the index is of the type `Float64Index` and the input key is of type `float`. 

The reason for this bug is that the method is not properly handling the cases when the index contains float values and when the input key is a float. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` method to correctly handle float keys when the index is a `Float64Index`. We should also handle the case when the input key is an integer. Finally, we should address the compatibility of the method with non-integer indexes and non-integer indexers.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """

    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, Float64Index):
            if isinstance(i, int):
                i = float(i)  # Convert integer to float
            if not isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on a float index can only have float indexers")
        else:
            if isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on a non-float index can only have non-float indexers")

    return key
```

With these changes, the method is now capable of handling float keys with `Float64Index` and appropriately raises an error for integer keys with a `Float64Index` and non-float keys with non-float indexes.
