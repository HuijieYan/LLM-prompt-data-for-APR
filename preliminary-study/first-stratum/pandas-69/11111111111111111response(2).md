The error occurs in the `_convert_key` method inside the `_AtIndexer` class. The ValueError is raised when the key is a non-integer and the index is non-integer, which causes the test cases to fail.

The bug occurs because the method does not handle the case when the key and index are non-integer. It only checks for integer and non-integer indexes without considering the type of the keys.

To fix the bug, the `_convert_key` method needs to handle the case when the key is non-integer and the index is non-integer. It should allow non-integer indexing for non-integer indexes without raising a ValueError.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    key_type = type(key)

    if not is_integer(key_type):  # assuming is_integer is a function that checks if the type is an integer
        return key  # allow non-integer indexing for non-integer indexes

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this correction, the method checks the type of the key and allows non-integer indexing for non-integer indexes. This should resolve the ValueError issue and make the test cases pass.
