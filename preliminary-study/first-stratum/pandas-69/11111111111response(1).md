1. The test case is checking if Series lookups are affected for the Float64Index case. The error message indicates that the issue is occurring in the `_convert_key` method, specifically when it raises a `ValueError` due to the indexing related checks.

2. The potential error location is the `_convert_key` method within the `_AtIndexer` class in the `IndexingMixin` class.

3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `_convert_key` method is not handling the indexing cases correctly, leading to the `ValueError` being raised.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include checking the types of the keys for arbitrary setting, handling integer and non-integer index cases correctly, and allowing for proper indexing based on the data type of the index.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_type_compatible(i):
            continue
        else:
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an {type1} index can only have {type2} indexers"
                .format(type1=ax.dtype, type2=ax.type_held())
            )
    return key
```
In the corrected code:
- The `_convert_key` now properly checks for the compatibility of the key types with the index types.
- It handles integer and non-integer index cases correctly and raises a `ValueError` with a specific error message.
