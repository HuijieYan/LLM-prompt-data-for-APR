The error message "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers" suggests that there is a type inconsistency in the indexing process when the key is being converted. This error occurs when the key is a float and the index is non-integer.

The potential error location could be within the _convert_key method, specifically in the section where it checks the type consistency of the key with the index.

The bug occurs because the logic in the _convert_key method is not handling the case where the key is a float and the index is non-integer. The current implementation only checks for the integer type and does not account for floats.

To fix the bug, the _convert_key method should be modified to handle float keys as well. It should first check if the index is integer or not, and then based on that, validate the key accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the _convert_key method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """

    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not isinstance(i, (int, float)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

In the corrected code, the isinstance() method is used to check if the key is either an integer or a float, based on the type of the index. This will handle the cases where the key is a float and the index is non-integer.
