The bug is occuring on the line `if is_integer(i):` and `if not ax.holds_integer():` in the `_convert_key` function. The `is_integer` and `holds_integer` functions are being invoked on the wrong variables.

The bug occurs because the `is_integer` and `holds_integer` functions are being called on the wrong objects. These functions should be called on the `i` variable instead of `ax`, and they should be instance methods of the `ax` object itself.

To fix this bug, the `_convert_key` function should be modified as follows:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """    
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_floating():  # Check if the index is a floating index
            if not pd.api.types.is_float(i):  # Check if the key is a float
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a floating index "
                    "can only have float indexers"
                )
        else:
            if pd.api.types.is_float(i) and not ax.holds_floating():  
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-floating index "
                    "can only have non-float "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This updated function fixes the bug by checking if the index is a floating index using the `ax.is_floating()` function and verifying if the key is a float using `pd.api.types.is_float(i)`. The function `ax.holds_floating()` is used to verify if the index holds floating values.

After applying these changes, the function should work correctly and eliminate the "ValueError: At based indexing on an non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers" error.
