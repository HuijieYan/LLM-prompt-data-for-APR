1. The test case is trying to perform various lookups on a Series using the `get_value`, `[]`, `loc`, and `at` methods, with different types of index values and ensuring that the result matches the expected value. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the `_convert_key` function, which is used to format the key before performing the lookup. The test is failing due to the validation checks in the `_convert_key` function.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the validation checks in the `for` loop, which validate the index values based on whether the axis is an integer or not.

3. The bug occurs because the `_convert_key` function is not handling the conversion of the index value correctly in some cases. It fails to correctly validate the index values based on the axis type and results in a ValueError being raised when it shouldn't.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Checking the data types and handling the conversion of index values appropriately within the `_convert_key` function.
   - Ensuring that the validation checks accurately determine whether the index values are compatible with the axis type.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    # Allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    converted_key = []
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not isinstance(i, int):  # Check if axis is integer and index value is not an integer
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not ax.is_integer() and isinstance(i, int):  # Check if axis is non-integer and index value is an integer
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
        else:
            converted_key.append(i)
    
    return tuple(converted_key)
```

In the corrected code:
- The `_convert_key` function now iterates through each axis and index value, validating whether they are compatible.
- It ensures that the index values are correctly converted based on the axis type and then returned as a tuple.

By making these changes, we can prevent the ValueError from being raised incorrectly and allow the test case to pass successfully.
