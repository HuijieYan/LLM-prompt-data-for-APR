The error occurs in the `_convert_key` function of the `_AtIndexer` class. This function is meant to convert the key used for indexing into a proper format, checking whether the index is an integer and making sure the key is of the same type as the index.

The bug occurs when checking the type of the index and the key. It fails to correctly identify the type of the index and key in certain cases, leading to a ValueError being raised.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the case when the index is a Float64Index and the key is a float. It should also accommodate the case when the index is a DatetimeIndex or TimedeltaIndex, thus ensuring that the correct checks are made based on the index type and the key.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, Float64Index):
            if isinstance(i, (int, float)):
                if not ax.is_integer() and not ax.is_floating():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer index of type Float64Index "
                        "can only have non-integer indexers"
                    )
        elif isinstance(self.obj, (DatetimeIndex, TimedeltaIndex)):
            if ax.is_integer() and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                    "can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not ax.is_integer():
                if not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
    return key
```

This corrected code handles the different cases of index and key combinations, correctly identifying the type of the index and key and performing the necessary checks. This should ensure that the ValueError is not raised in the identified cases, fixing the bug.
