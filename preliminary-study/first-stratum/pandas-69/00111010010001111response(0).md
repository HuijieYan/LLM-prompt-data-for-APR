The bug in the provided function `_convert_key` is occurring because the code is checking for the type of the index incorrectly. It is attempting to handle integer and non-integer indexers but is doing so in an incorrect way.

To fix this bug, we can rewrite the `_convert_key` function to handle the integer and non-integer indexers correctly. We should also address the `ax.is_integer()` and `ax.holds_integer()` checks for correctness.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, ABCNumericIndex):
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an numeric index "
                    "can only have numeric indexers"
                )
        elif isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex) and not isinstance(i, (datetime, pd.Timestamp, np.datetime64)):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a datetime index "
                "can only have datetime indexers"
            )
        elif isinstance(ax, TimedeltaIndex) and not isinstance(i, (timedelta, pd.Timedelta, np.timedelta64)):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a timedelta index "
                "can only have timedelta indexers"
            )
    return key
```

This corrected code checks the type of the index and the key appropriately and raises a value error if the types are not as expected.

These changes address the issues with integer and non-integer indexers. Now, when the `_convert_key` function is called with its input parameters and the provided variable values, it should return the expected output as mentioned in the "Expected variable value in tests" section. This should resolve the bug and align with the expected behavior.
