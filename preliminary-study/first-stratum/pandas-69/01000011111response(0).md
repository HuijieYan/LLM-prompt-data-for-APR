1. The test case is testing lookups for datetime-like values using Float64Index, which is causing an error in the `_convert_key` function. The error message indicates that the issue is with integer and non-integer indexes.

2. The potential error location within the `_convert_key` function is in the loop where it checks if the index is an integer or non-integer.

3. The bug is occurring because the function is not handling the case where the index is non-integer correctly. It is raising a ValueError even when the index is non-integer in some cases.

4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling non-integer indexes in the `_convert_key` function. Specifically, we need to handle non-integer indexes differently and not raise a ValueError in such cases.

5. Below is the corrected code for the problematic `_convert_key` function:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return key
    
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
This corrected code handles non-integer indexes differently by raising a ValueError only when the index is non-integer.
