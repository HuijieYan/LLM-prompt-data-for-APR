1. The test case is testing the behavior of several indexers (`.at`, `.loc`, `.iloc`, etc.) on a Series with a Float64Index. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the `_convert_key` method in the `_AtIndexer` class of the `pandas.core.indexing` module.

2. The potential error location is within the `_convert_key` method of the `_AtIndexer` class in the `pandas.core.indexing` module.

3. The bug occurs because the `_convert_key` method does not handle the conversion of keys properly, especially with non-integer indexes. This leads to the method raising a ValueError in certain cases.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_convert_key` method correctly handles both integer and non-integer indexes.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # Allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if pd.api.types.is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

In the corrected code:
- We properly handle the case where the index is non-integer by using `pd.api.types.is_integer` function to check if the key is an integer.
- We raise a ValueError in case of mismatch between the type of the key and the index to ensure that the method behaves correctly for both integer and non-integer indexes.
