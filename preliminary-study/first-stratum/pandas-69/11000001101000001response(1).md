The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the handling of datetimelike values. The function `_convert_key` is designed to convert keys, particularly for setting a value, and validates the index values before performing the conversion.

Based on the provided information, the issue emerges from the conversions of keys when datetimelike values are involved. In both buggy cases, the key `4.0` is related to datetimelike indexes, and the function is expected to handle these cases appropriately.

To fix the bug, the `_convert_key` function should be updated to explicitly check for datetimelike indexes and handle the conversion accordingly. This may involve converting floating-point indexes to the nearest or exact datetimelike index if it exists to maintain consistency.

Additionally, the TypeError raised when a float is encountered in the non-integer index but should be an integer could be due to incorrect variable type usage when checking whether `i` is an integer. This check should be adjusted to accurately determine the type of `i`.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                    "can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This updated function explicitly checks the type of `i` when validating the indexes, ensuring the correct type comparison is performed.
