The bug occurs in the `_convert_key` function which is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing. However, it doesn't handle non-integer indexes correctly. The function checks if the index is an integer type but it doesn't appropriately handle non-integer indexes, leading to the ValueError.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly handle non-integer indexes. We can achieve this by checking if the index is a non-integer and then handling it accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                    "can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

In this corrected code, we first check if the index is an integer. If it is, we check if the indexer is an integer. Otherwise, we assume it is non-integer, and hence raise a ValueError if the indexer is not a non-integer. This modification ensures that the function properly handles both integer and non-integer indexes.
