The error message "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers" indicates that the bug occurs when trying to perform an 'at' based indexing operation on an integer index with a floating point value.

Looking at the function `_convert_key`, the issue lies with the validation check for integer and non-integer indexes. Specifically, in the if-else statement, the conditions for checking if an index is an integer or non-integer are incorrect.

To fix this bug, the validation logic for checking whether the index is an integer or non-integer needs to be revised. Instead of using `is_integer()` and `holds_integer()` as methods on the axis, we should use `is_floating()` to check whether the index is a floating point value.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_floating():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this correction, the function should now validate the key based on whether the index is a floating point value or not, rather than directly checking for integer or non-integer properties. This change should resolve the bug and prevent the 'At based indexing' error.
