The buggy function seems to be aimed at converting the input key to a list if it's a setter, otherwise it iterates over the axes of the object and performs certain checks depending on the type of the axis. The bug is likely occurring due to incorrect type checking and handling.

The first identified issue is that the function is using ax.is_integer() and ax.holds_integer() methods, but it's not using ax.is_floating(), which likely is causing problems when dealing with float key values.

To fix the bug, you should add a check for floating values and handle them appropriately.

Additionally, there are inconsistencies in the variable naming and types of `is_integer` and `holds_integer` in the buggy function. Proper type checking and casting should be done for these variables.

The corrected function could look something like this:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_floating():
            if not isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a float index can only have float indexers"
                )
        elif ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not isinstance(i, float) and not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

By modifying the type checking within the function and handling float values properly, this corrected code should address the issues with the buggy function.
