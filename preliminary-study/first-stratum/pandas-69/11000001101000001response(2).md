Potential error location:
The potential error location within the problematic function is in the for loop where the types of the index and the indexers are being verified.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the type of the indexers (i) and the type of the index (ax) are not being handled correctly. The function is checking for the integer or non-integer status of the index, but it's not handling the float/indexer types properly, resulting in the mismatch.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the index is of type Float64Index and then handle float indexers separately in the for loop.
2. Use the isinstance() method in the if-else conditions to check if the index is of the required type.

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.Index):
            if not isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```
