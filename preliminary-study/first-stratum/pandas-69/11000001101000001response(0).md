The bug is in the _convert_key() method, which is used to convert the key parameter based on certain conditions. The method receives a key and an is_setter boolean flag, and based on the value of is_setter, it either returns a list of keys or validates the indexers in the key based on conditions defined in the code.

The expected behavior is that the method should correctly handle both integer and non-integer indexes. However, it seems to be encountering issues with handling integer and non-integer indexers correctly, leading to the bugs in the function.

To fix the bug, the conditions for checking integer and non-integer indexers should be reviewed and adjusted to handle the cases where the indexers are of float or integer type. Additionally, it's important to ensure that the key is appropriately handled based on the is_setter flag.

Here's the corrected function/method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if pd.api.types.is_integer(ax):
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers")
        else:
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i) and not pd.api.types.is_float(i):
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on an non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers")
    return key
```
