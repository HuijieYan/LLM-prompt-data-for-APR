1. The test case is testing the index lookups for `float64` and `integer` values in a Series. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the `_convert_key` method when handling non-integer indexes.

2. The potential error location can be identified in the `_convert_key` method where it checks if the index is integer or not.

3. The bug occurs because the `_convert_key` method is incorrectly handling non-integer indexes, leading to the ValueError being raised.

4. One possible approach to fixing the bug is to ensure that the `_convert_key` method correctly handles both integer and non-integer indexes, performing the appropriate validation for each type of index.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    # Check for non-integer indexes
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_integer(i) and ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                    "can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```
In the corrected code, we have added a check for non-integer indexes and adjusted the validation logic to handle both integer and non-integer indexes correctly.
