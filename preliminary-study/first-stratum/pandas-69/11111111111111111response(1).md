The error is occurring in the `_convert_key` method. This method is used to convert the key based on certain conditions and is throwing a ValueError when an integer index can only have integer indexers, and a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers.

The bug is happening because the method is incorrectly checking the type of the index and the key without accounting for the possibility of different data types.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the method to check the types of the index and key more accurately and handle cases where they may have different data types.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """

    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)
    
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if not isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            if not isinstance(ax, type(i)):
                raise ValueError(
                    f"At based indexing on a {type(ax).__name__} index "
                    f"can only have {type(ax).__name__} indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not np.issubdtype(type(i), np.floating):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer index "
                    "can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

In the revised method, we first check whether the index is a `Float64Index` and handle the case where it's not. For non-`Float64Index` types, we compare the type of the index and the key. For `Float64Index`, we directly check if the key is of a floating data type. This approach allows for more accurate handling of different data type scenarios and should resolve the issue.
