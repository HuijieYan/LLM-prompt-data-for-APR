The bug occurs in the `_convert_key` method of the `_AtIndexer` class in the pandas library. The error message indicates that there is a problem with indexing on a non-integer index for non-integer indexers. This error occurs when the method is called with a key that doesn't match the index type.

To fix this bug, the `_convert_key` method needs to be updated to handle different types of keys and index types correctly.

Here is the corrected method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index to avoid falling back.
    """

    # Allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, (int, float)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a Float64Index can only have integer or float indexers"
                )
        elif isinstance(ax, (pd.DatetimeIndex, pd.TimedeltaIndex)):
            if not isinstance(i, (pd.Timestamp, pd.Timedelta)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a DatetimeIndex or TimedeltaIndex can only have Timestamp or Timedelta indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

In the updated method, we first check the type of the index and then compare the type of the key accordingly. If the types do not match, a ValueError is raised with an appropriate message.

This approach provides a more robust check for the types of keys and index, preventing the bug from occurring.

The corrected method will address the issue of improper indexing on different types of indexes and ensure that it handles the keys and index types correctly.
