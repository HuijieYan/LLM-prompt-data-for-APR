The error occurs in the `_convert_key` function, where it fails to handle the cases for non-integer indexes when using the `at` based indexing with integer or non-integer indexers.

The bug occurs because the function is not handling the cases for non-integer indexes properly, leading to a ValueError being raised in the test cases for the `at` based indexing.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function to properly handle the cases for non-integer indexes when using the `at` based indexing with integer or non-integer indexers.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i):
                if ax.holds_integer():
                    # Cast the integer to float, matching the behavior of .loc
                    i = float(i)
                else:
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
    return key
```

With the above corrections made to the `_convert_key` function, the bug should be fixed and the test cases for the `at` based indexing should pass without raising any ValueError.
