The error occurs in the `_convert_key` function when it tries to handle integer and non-integer keys for the index. The function is intended to convert the key to a list only if `is_setter` is True. In the current implementation, it checks for integer and non-integer keys but does not handle them correctly based on the index type.

To fix the bug, the function needs to identify the type of the index and handle integer and non-integer keys accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index, unless for setting purposes.
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    index_type = type(self.obj)  # Get the type of the index

    if index_type == pd.DatetimeIndex:
        if any(not np.equal(np.mod(i, 1), 0) for i in key):
            raise ValueError("At based indexing on a datetime index can only have integer indexers")
    elif index_type == pd.TimedeltaIndex:
        if any(np.equal(np.mod(i, 1), 0) for i in key):
            raise ValueError("At based indexing on a timedelta index can only have non-integer indexers")
    elif issubclass(index_type, pd.NumericIndex):
        if any(not np.equal(np.mod(i, 1), 0) for i in key):
            raise ValueError("At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers")
    else:
        raise ValueError("Unsupported index type")

    return key
```

In the corrected code, we first identify the type of the index and then handle the keys based on the index type. This approach ensures that the keys are handled correctly according to the index type, resolving the bug.
