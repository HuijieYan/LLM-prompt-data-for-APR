Potential error location: The error seems to be related to the `_convert_key` function, as it raises a `ValueError` when the keys are non-integer for non-integer indexes.

Reason for the occurrence of the bug: The `_convert_key` function is not handling non-integer keys for non-integer indexes correctly. It should allow non-integer keys for non-integer indexes.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add a check to handle non-integer keys for non-integer indexes appropriately.
2. Update the conditional statements to handle different index types and keys accordingly.

```python
# Corrected function for _convert_key
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not ax.is_floating() and is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```
The corrected function now checks if the index is non-integer and ensures that the keys are also non-integer. If the index is integer, it requires integer keys. This update should prevent the ValueError that was previously occurring.
