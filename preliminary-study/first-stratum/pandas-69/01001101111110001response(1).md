The issue in the `_convert_key` function arises from the fact that it attempts to handle different data types (integer, float, datetime, timedelta) in the same way, which leads to errors when dealing with integer and non-integer values.

The function checks whether the index is integer or non-integer. However, the implementation does not properly handle floats that may represent integer values (e.g., 4.0 in the input key).

To fix this bug, the function needs to be updated to handle float values that represent integers differently from float values that represent non-integer values. This could involve checking whether the float value is a whole number or contains decimal places.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not i.is_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if i.is_integer() and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

In the corrected code, the `is_integer` method is called on `i` to determine if the key element is an integer or not. This change ensures that the function handles integer and non-integer values correctly.
