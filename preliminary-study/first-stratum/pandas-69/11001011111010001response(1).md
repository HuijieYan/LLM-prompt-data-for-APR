The bug occurs in the _convert_key method. The bug is due to the incorrect handling of integer and non-integer indexes. The method is supposed to determine whether the key provided is compatible with the index, but it currently checks for integer keys in a non-integer index and vice versa.

To fix the bug, the method should check if the keys are compatible with the index type. For integer indexes, only integer keys should be allowed, and for non-integer indexes, only non-integer keys should be allowed.

Below is the corrected _convert_key method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
        if not ax.is_integer() and is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```

This corrected method checks for compatibility between the index type and the keys provided, ensuring that only integer keys are allowed for integer indexes and non-integer keys for non-integer indexes.
