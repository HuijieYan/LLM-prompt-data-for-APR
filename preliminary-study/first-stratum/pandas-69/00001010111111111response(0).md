The error occurs in the `_convert_key` function where it fails under certain conditions, such as when the index is a Float64Index.

The bug occurs because the function is trying to convert the index to a list without considering the index type. This causes issues when the index is of type `Float64Index`.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `_convert_key` function to handle different types of index appropriately. This can be achieved by checking the type of the index and applying the suitable conversion. 

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    index = self.obj.axes[0]
    key_list = []
    for i in key:
        if not isinstance(i, type(index)):
            i = index._coerce_scalar_to_index(i)  # Coerce a scalar value to the index type
        key_list.append(i)

    return tuple(key_list)
```

In this corrected function, we are iterating through the keys and checking if they are of the same type as the index. If not, we are coercing the scalar value to the index type. Finally, we return the keys as a tuple after applying the necessary conversions.

This modification ensures that keys are correctly handled based on the index type, thus fixing the bug.
