The error is occurring because the `process_list_block` function is not properly processing the input and is not returning the expected output. The function is intended to process a block of text within a docstring and make certain modifications, such as adding a marker and modifying the structure of the text block.

The potential error within the function could be due to the incorrect slicing and modification of the `docstring` variable. Additionally, there might be issues with the regular expressions used to modify the text block.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
1. Ensuring that the slicing of the `docstring` variable is done correctly to capture the entire block that needs to be processed.
2. Verifying the regular expressions used for modifying the text block to ensure that they are capturing the correct patterns.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else
                                      ending_point)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    # Usually lines have at least 4 additional leading spaces.
    # These have to be removed, but first the list roots have to be detected.
    top_level_regex = r'^    ([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)'
    top_level_replacement = r'- __\1__:\2'
    lines = [re.sub(top_level_regex, top_level_replacement, line) for line in lines]
    # All the other lines get simply the 4 leading space (if present) removed
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ', '', line) for line in lines]
    # Fix text lines after lists
    indent = 0
    text_block = False
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        spaces = re.search(r'\S', line)
        if spaces:
            # If it is a list element
            if line[spaces.start()] == '-':
                indent = spaces.start() + 1
                if text_block:
                    text_block = False
                    lines[i] = '\n' + line
            elif spaces.start() < indent:
                text_block = True
                indent = spaces.start()
                lines[i] = '\n' + line
        else:
            text_block = False
            indent = 0
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
```

In this corrected version, I fixed the slicing of the `block` variable and ensured that the modifications and replacements are done correctly using regular expressions.
