1. The test case is failing because the `process_list_block` function is not correctly formatting the list items, causing the markdown comparison to fail in the test case.

2. The potential error location within the `process_list_block` function is in the list formatting and indentation logic, specifically in the `top_level_regex` and `top_level_replacement` section.

3. The bug is occurring because the function is trying to process list items and format them into markdown, but the logic for identifying list items and formatting them into markdown is not properly implemented. This is causing incorrect formatting and indentation of list items, leading to the failure of the markdown comparison in the test case.

4. To fix the bug, we need to correctly identify list items and properly format them into markdown. This can be achieved by adjusting the regular expressions and logic used to detect and format list items. Additionally, ensuring that the correct number of leading spaces is preserved and that the correct markdown syntax for unordered lists (bullets) is used is crucial for fixing the bug.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else ending_point - 1)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]

    # Handle list formatting
    lines = [re.sub(r'^\s*(- \*\*__[^:]+:\*\*\s*)(.*)$', r'- __\1__:\2', line) for line in lines]
    lines = [re.sub(r'^\s*(-)(.*)$', r'-\2', line) for line in lines]
    
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
```

In the corrected code, we have adjusted the regular expression patterns to correctly identify and format list items, ensuring that the correct markdown syntax for unordered lists (bullets) is used. This should fix the bug and resolve the markdown comparison failure in the test case.
