The bug in the provided function `process_list_block` seems to be related to the manipulation of the `docstring` and `block` variables. The function is intended to process a list block within a docstring, but it seems to have issues with correctly placing the marker and manipulating the list items.

The error message from the test function indicates that the formatting of the docstring is incorrect, specifically related to the bullet points under the "Arguments" section.

The bug in the function could be attributed to how the `marker` is being replaced and the subsequent processing of the list items.

Potential approach for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the marker is correctly placed within the `docstring` to indicate the location of the list block.
2. Modify the logic for processing list items to ensure correct indentation and bullet points.
3. Handle the case where the ending_point is -1 properly to avoid an index error.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    if ending_point == -1:
        ending_point = len(docstring)  # Handle if end not found
    block = docstring[starting_point:ending_point]
    
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = docstring[:starting_point] + docstring_slice + docstring[section_end:]

    lines = block.strip().split('\n')
    lines = [re.sub(r'^ {' + str(leading_spaces) + '}', '', line) for line in lines]  # Remove leading spaces

    # Replace list items with bullet points
    lines = ['- ' + line.lstrip() if line.lstrip().startswith('-') else line for line in lines]
    
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    
    return docstring, block
```

In the corrected function, the list items are properly aligned with bullet points, and the marker is placed at the correct location in the `docstring`. Additionally, the handling of the `ending_point` when it's -1 has been modified to avoid an index error.
