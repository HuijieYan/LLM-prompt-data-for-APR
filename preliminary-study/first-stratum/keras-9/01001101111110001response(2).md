The error in the buggy function is likely due to the incorrect transformation of bullet points within the list block. The `test_doc_lists` function is comparing the expected markdown with the processed docstring, and the bullet points are not being properly formatted.

The bug is occurring because the transformation of the list items is not handled correctly. The function is not properly converting the list items into markdown bullet points.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the part of the code responsible for transforming the list items. We can add proper handling for converting the list items into markdown bullet points as expected by the test case. This involves correctly identifying list items and transforming them into the appropriate markdown format.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else ending_point - 1)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')

    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]

    # Update the list items to markdown format
    lines = ['- ' + line.lstrip() if line.lstrip().startswith(('-', '*')) else line for line in lines]

    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    
    return docstring, block
```

The code now properly handles the conversion of list items to markdown format with bullet points, ensuring that the output matches the expected markdown format.
