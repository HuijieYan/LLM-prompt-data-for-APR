The bug in the `process_list_block` function seems to be related to the incorrect replacement of text in the `docstring` and improper markdown conversion.

The `docstring` replacement using the `replace` function might not be correctly handling the boundaries. This could result in incorrect slicing and replacement of the `docstring`.

One possible approach to fixing this bug could be to review the logic for slicing and replacing the `docstring` and ensure that it is done correctly. Additionally, the markdown conversion logic could be reviewed to ensure that the list elements are being properly formatted.

Another approach could be to use regular expressions to identify the list structures and modify them accordingly to ensure correct markdown output.

Here's the modified function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else ending_point - 1)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]

    # Replace list structures with markdown format
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)', r'- __\1__:\2', line) for line in lines]  # top level replacement
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    -', '- ', line) for line in lines]  # list elements
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ', '', line) for line in lines]  # remove additional leading spaces
    
    # Fix text lines after lists
    res = []
    for line in lines:
        if line.startswith('-'):
            res.append(f'- {line.strip("-")}')
        else:
            res.append(line)

    block = '\n'.join(res)
    return docstring, block
```

This modified function uses regular expressions to handle the replacement of list structures and also ensures proper markdown formatting for lists.
