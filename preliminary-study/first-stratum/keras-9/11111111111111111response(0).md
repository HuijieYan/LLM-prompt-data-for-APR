The buggy function `process_list_block` processes a block of text in a docstring to fix the formatting of lists and other elements. It seems to be intended to add a marker and format the text to improve its appearance, but it's currently not working as intended.

The error message from the test function indicates that the formatting of the docstring is not as expected, specifically with regards to the bullet points and list items. This suggests that the issue lies within the `process_list_block` function, where the formatting and manipulation of the text are not producing the desired result.

The potential error location is likely in the manipulation of the `lines` variable, where various substitutions and manipulations are being performed to remove leading spaces and format list items.

The current bug is likely caused by incorrect string manipulations and replacements within the `process_list_block` function. The manipulation of the `lines` variable to remove leading spaces and format list items is not producing the expected output, leading to incorrect formatting in the docstring.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to revise the string manipulations and replacements within the `process_list_block` function. This may involve re-evaluating the regular expressions and replacements used to identify and format list items, as well as ensuring that the list structures are correctly maintained.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else ending_point - 1)]

    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])

    lines = block.split('\n')

    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]

    # Format list items
    lines = [f'- {line}' if re.match(r'^\s*[-*+]', line) else line for line in lines]

    block = '\n'.join(lines)

    return docstring, block
```

In the corrected code:
- I removed the complex regular expressions and replacements for handling list formatting, and instead used a simpler approach to prepend each line with a bullet point if it represents a list item.
- This ensures that the list items are correctly formatted and do not lose their structure.
- The `docstring` and `block` are then returned as expected.
