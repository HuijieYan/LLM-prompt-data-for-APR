The bug in the given function is causing the `docstring` and `block` variables to be incorrectly updated, leading to a failed test case. This results in incorrect formatting of the output and failure of the associated test case.

The issue seems to be primarily related to the handling of the `block` variable and manipulations done with it. The bug causes incorrect replacement and formatting of the `docstring` and `block`, ultimately leading to a failed test case where the expected and actual values do not match.

To fix this bug, the function needs to be modified to ensure that the `docstring` and `block` variables are correctly updated as per the expected format.

Corrected code for the problematic function is provided below:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else ending_point)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = docstring[:starting_point] + docstring_slice + docstring[section_end:]
    lines = block.split('\n')
    lines = [line.lstrip() for line in lines]
    lines = [re.sub(r'^\s*(\S.*?):', r'- __\1__:', line) for line in lines]
    lines = [re.sub(r'^[-*] ', '', line) for line in lines]
    
    indent = 0
    text_block = False
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        spaces = re.search(r'^\s*', line)
        if spaces:
            if line.startswith('-'):
                if len(spaces.group(0)) > indent:
                    text_block = False
                indent = len(spaces.group(0))
            lines[i] = line[indent:]
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
```

The corrected function ensures correct formatting and updating of the `docstring` and `block` based on the input parameters. This modified function is expected to address the faulty behavior and produce the expected output for the associated test cases.
