The error occurs because the block of text within the `docstring` is not being processed correctly. The function `process_list_block` is responsible for processing the block of text and applying some transformations to it. However, it seems that the logic inside the function is not handling the block of text correctly, resulting in the incorrect representation of bullet points and indentation.

To fix the bug, there are several steps that can be taken:
1. Update the logic to correctly identify and process the block of text within the `docstring`.
2. Check the regular expressions used to ensure they are correctly capturing the list items and their indentation.
3. Provide proper handling for the indentation and bullet points to ensure the correct representation of the lists.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:ending_point]  # Corrected the slicing logic
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        spaces = re.search(r'^\s*\S', line)
        if spaces:
            if line.lstrip()[0] == '-':
                lines[i] = '- ' + line.lstrip()[1:]  # Adding proper bullet points
        lines[i] = re.sub(r'^\s{4}', '', lines[i])  # Removing 4 leading spaces
    
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
```

This corrected code applies better logic for processing the block of text, properly handling the bullet points and indentation, and applying the necessary transformations to ensure the correct representation of the lists.
