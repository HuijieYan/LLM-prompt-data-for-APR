The error seems to be related to the incorrect formatting of the list items in the docstring. The function `process_list_block` is supposed to process the list block within the docstring and replace it with a marker, which can later be replaced with the actual list formatting. However, there seems to be a bug in the function that is causing the incorrect replacement of the list block and leading to the assertion error in the test.

The bug seems to be related to the way the `docstring_slice` is being replaced with the `marker`. This replacement is not accurately capturing the list elements and causing issues with the later formatting of the list items.

To fix this issue, the function needs to accurately generate the `docstring_slice` and replace it with the `marker`. Additionally, there could be issues with the processing of list items that need to be handled properly to ensure correct formatting.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else ending_point - 1)]
    
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = block.replace('\n    ', '\n' + marker).replace(marker + '\n', marker)
    docstring = docstring[:starting_point] + docstring_slice + docstring[section_end:]
    
    lines = block.split('\n')
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    
    # Correcting the formatting of list items
    lines = [re.sub(r'^- ', r'<li>', line) + '</li>' if line.strip().startswith('-') else line for line in lines]
    block = '<ul>\n' + '\n'.join(lines) + '\n</ul>'
    
    return docstring, block
```

In this corrected code, I've modified the `docstring_slice` creation and replaced the list items with the provided marker to accurately represent the list block. Additionally, I've added formatting to convert the list items into proper HTML `<ul>` and `<li>` elements, which seems to be the expected format based on the test case.

This should resolve the issue and ensure that the list block is properly processed and formatted, leading to a successful test case.
