The bug seems to be related to the transformation of the docstring and the block. The function `process_list_block` is responsible for parsing the docstring and transforming it into a different format.

The incorrect transformation of the docstring and block suggests that the `ending_point` calculation is off. In the buggy code, the `ending_point` is calculated as the position of the first occurrence of `'\n\n'` from `starting_point`. However, the slicing is done incorrectly after the calculation.

The issue with incorrect formatting of bullet points in documentation is related to the incorrect transformation performed by the `process_list_block` function.

To fix the bug:
1. The calculation of `ending_point` needs to be fixed to correctly identify the end of the block within the docstring.
2. The slicing and replacement of the block with the marker needs to be fixed to ensure that it captures the correct portion of the docstring.

Here's the corrected `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(ending_point if ending_point != -1 else len(docstring))]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    # Usually lines have at least 4 additional leading spaces.
    # These have to be removed, but first the list roots have to be detected.
    top_level_regex = r'^    ([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)'
    top_level_replacement = r'- __\1__:\2'
    lines = [re.sub(top_level_regex, top_level_replacement, line) for line in lines]
    # All the other lines get simply the 4 leading space (if present) removed
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ', '', line) for line in lines]
    # Fix text lines after lists
    indent = 0
    text_block = False
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        spaces = re.search(r'\S', line)
        if spaces:
            # If it is a list element
            if line[spaces.start()] == '-':
                indent = spaces.start() + 1
                if text_block:
                    text_block = False
                    lines[i] = '\n' + line
            elif spaces.start() < indent:
                text_block = True
                indent = spaces.start()
                lines[i] = '\n' + line
        else:
            text_block = False
            indent = 0
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
```

This corrected function addresses the issues with the calculation of `ending_point` and ensures that the slicing and replacement of the block within the docstring is done correctly.
