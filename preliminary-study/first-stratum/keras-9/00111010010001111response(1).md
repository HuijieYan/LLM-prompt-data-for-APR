The bug in the `process_list_block` function seems to be related to the incorrect placement of the marker within the `docstring_slice`. This causes the replacement to be incorrect, leading to the incorrect display of bullet points in the documentation.

The root cause of the bug is the incorrect replacement of the `block` with the `marker` within the `docstring_slice`. Additionally, there seems to be an off-by-one error in the calculation of the `ending_point` when extracting the `block` from the `docstring`.

To fix the bug, the function needs to ensure that the `block` is replaced with the `marker` correctly within the `docstring_slice`, and the `ending_point` calculation should be adjusted to include the second newline character in the `block`.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else ending_point + 2)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]

    # ... (the rest of the function remains unchanged)

    return docstring, '\n'.join(lines)
```

In this corrected code, the `ending_point` calculation has been adjusted to include the second newline character in the `block`, and the replacement of `block` with `marker` within `docstring_slice` has been corrected.

This should fix the issue with the incorrect display of bullet points in the documentation.
