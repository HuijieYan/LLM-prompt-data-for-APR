The test case is comparing the expected markdown output with the actual markdown output. The error is occurring because the actual markdown output contains an unordered list (`<ul>` and `<li>`) while the expected markdown output does not.

The bug in the function is that it is not formatting the list items correctly. It should convert the list items into an unordered list (`<ul>`) with list items (`<li>`).

The reason behind the bug is that the function is not properly handling the transformation of the list items into HTML unordered list format.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly format the list items into an HTML unordered list format and ensure that the transformation is correctly handled.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else
                                      ending_point - 1)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    # Convert list into HTML unordered list format
    lines = ['<li>' + line + '</li>' for line in lines if line.strip()]
    block = '<ul>\n' + '\n'.join(lines) + '\n</ul>'
    return docstring, block
```

With this corrected function, the list items will be properly transformed into an HTML unordered list format, and the error in the test case should be resolved.
