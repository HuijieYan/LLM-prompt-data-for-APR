The bug appears to be in the function `process_list_block`, where it's not correctly updating the `docstring` and `block` values as per the expected output.

The issue seems to be related to how the `docstring` and `block` are being modified within the function. The `docstring` is not getting updated correctly, and the `block` variable processing may also not be accurate.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to ensure that the `docstring` is updated as expected, and the `block` variable processing should be accurate to maintain proper indentation and formatting.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else
                                      ending_point - 1)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    # Usually lines have at least 4 additional leading spaces.
    # These have to be removed, but first the list roots have to be detected.
    top_level_regex = r'^([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)'
    top_level_replacement = r'- __\1__:\2'
    lines = [re.sub(top_level_regex, top_level_replacement, line) for line in lines]
    # All the other lines get simply the 4 leading space (if present) removed
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ', '', line) for line in lines]
    # Fix text lines after lists
    indent = 0
    text_lines = []
    for line in lines:
        spaces = re.search(r'\S', line)
        if spaces:
            if line.lstrip()[0] == '-':
                indent = len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) + 1
                if text_lines and text_lines[-1].lstrip()[0] == '-':
                    text_lines.append('\n' + line)
                else:
                    text_lines.append(line)
            elif len(line.lstrip()) < indent:
                text_lines.append('\n' + line)
            else:
                text_lines[-1] += ' ' + line.lstrip()
        else:
            text_lines.append(line)
    block = '\n'.join(text_lines)
    return docstring, block
```
