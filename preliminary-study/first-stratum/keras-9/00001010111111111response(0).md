The bug in the `process_list_block` function is likely causing the `test_doc_lists` test case to fail. The function appears to be modifying the `docstring` and `block` variables, and the changes in the `docstring` are likely causing the test to fail when checking for equality with `docs_descriptor['result']`.

The bug seems to be related to how the `docstring` and `block` variables are being processed and modified, resulting in unexpected changes to the format.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the modifications made to the `docstring` and `block` variables do not alter the original format of the input. Additionally, the replacements and modifications in the `block` variable should be done in a way that reflects the expected format and structure of the output.

Here's the corrected `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    block = docstring[starting_point:section_end]
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = docstring[:starting_point] + docstring_slice + docstring[section_end:]
  
    lines = block.split('\n')
    lines = [re.sub(r'^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]

    top_level_regex = r'^(\s+)([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)'
    top_level_replacement = r'\1- __\2__:\3'
    lines = [re.sub(top_level_regex, top_level_replacement, line) for line in lines]

    lines = [re.sub(r'^(\s{4})', '', line) for line in lines]

    indent = 0
    text_block = False
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        if line.lstrip().startswith('-'):
            indent = len(re.match(r"\s*", line).group())
            if text_block:
                text_block = False
                lines[i] = '\n' + line
        elif len(re.match(r"\s*", line).group()) < indent:
            text_block = True
            indent = len(re.match(r"\s*", line).group())
            lines[i] = '\n' + line
        else:
            text_block = False
            indent = 0

    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
```

This corrected function addresses the formatting issues and should ensure that the modifications are consistent with the expected structure of the output.
