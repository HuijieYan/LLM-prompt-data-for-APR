The issue seems to be with the way the `process_list_block` function is handling the `docstring` and the `block`. The function is trying to replace a block of text with a marker and then process the lines, but the slicing and replacing appears to be incorrect.

It seems that the `ending_point` is calculated incorrectly, and the slicing of `docstring` to create `docstring_slice` is also not accurate. This is likely causing the subsequent processing to be incorrect, resulting in the wrong `docstring` and `block` values.

To fix this bug, you can try the following approaches:
1. Update the calculation of `ending_point` to find the correct index of the end of the block within the `docstring`.
2. Modify the slicing and replacement of the block within the `docstring` to ensure it accurately captures the block and replaces it with the marker.
3. Revise the processing of lines to ensure it handles the block and its indentation correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else
                                      ending_point + 2)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[:starting_point] + marker + docstring[section_end:]
    lines = block.split('\n')
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)', r'- __\1__:\2', line) for line in lines]
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ', '', line) for line in lines]

    # Fix text lines after lists
    new_lines = []
    indent = 0
    text_block = False
    for line in lines:
        spaces = re.search(r'\S', line)
        if spaces:
            if line[spaces.start()] == '-':
                indent = spaces.start() + 1
                if text_block:
                    text_block = False
                    new_lines.append('\n' + line)
                else:
                    new_lines.append(line)
            elif spaces.start() < indent:
                text_block = True
                indent = spaces.start()
                new_lines.append('\n' + line)
            else:
                new_lines.append(line)
        else:
            text_block = False
            indent = 0
            new_lines.append(line)

    block = '\n'.join(new_lines)

    return docstring_slice, block
``` 

This updated function should resolve the issues with the handling of the `docstring`, the block, and the processing of lines, ensuring that the output matches the expected values.
