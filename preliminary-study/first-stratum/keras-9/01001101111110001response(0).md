The error message indicates a mismatch between the expected and actual values of the docstrings. The test function is comparing the expected docstring with the actual docstring generated by the `process_list_block` function.

The potential error location within the `process_list_block` function is likely in the string manipulation and list processing steps, as the `process_list_block` function modifies the structure of the docstring and is responsible for processing lists within the docstring.

The bug likely occurred due to incorrect handling of the list format within the docstring. The function seems to be incorrectly replacing the list elements and not properly using the marker to reinject the modified list elements into the docstring. Additionally, there may be issues with the removal of leading spaces from the list elements.

One approach to fixing the bug is to ensure that the list processing logic properly splits, processes, and reassembles the list elements within the docstring. Specifically, the markers and leading spaces should be handled correctly in order to maintain the structure of the docstring.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else ending_point)]
    
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    
    lines = block.split('\n')
    
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]

    # Process list elements
    new_lines = []
    for line in lines:
        if line.strip().startswith('-'):
            new_lines.append('- ' + line.lstrip('- '))
        else:
            new_lines.append(line)
    
    block = '\n'.join(new_lines)
    
    return docstring, block
```

In the corrected code, the list elements are processed to ensure the proper formatting of list items and the removal of leading spaces. This approach should address the issues identified and provide the expected behavior for the `process_list_block` function.
