The potential error in the function is when it tries to find the ending_point. The condition `ending_point - 1` may cause an issue when `ending_point` is -1, as it results in a negative index for `docstring`. This will lead to incorrect slicing of the `docstring`, resulting in the wrong value for `block`.

The reason for the bug is that the function does not handle the case where the `ending_point` is -1 correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `ending_point` is -1 separately from the case where it's not. We can do this using an if-else statement.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    if ending_point == -1:
        block = docstring[starting_point:]
    else:
        block = docstring[starting_point:ending_point - 1]
    
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    
    top_level_regex = r'^    ([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)'
    top_level_replacement = r'- __\1__:\2'
    lines = [re.sub(top_level_regex, top_level_replacement, line) for line in lines]
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ', '', line) for line in lines]
    
    indent = 0
    text_block = False
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        spaces = re.search(r'\S', line)
        if spaces:
            if line[spaces.start()] == '-':
                indent = spaces.start() + 1
                if text_block:
                    text_block = False
                    lines[i] = '\n' + line
            elif spaces.start() < indent:
                text_block = True
                indent = spaces.start()
                lines[i] = '\n' + line
        else:
            text_block = False
            indent = 0
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    
    return docstring, block
```

In the corrected code, the `if ending_point == -1` statement correctly handles the case where `ending_point` is -1, and the slicing of `docstring` is adjusted accordingly.
