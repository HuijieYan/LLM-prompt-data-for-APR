The potential error in the 'process_list_block' function lies in the calculation of the 'ending_point' variable. The value of '-1' is being assigned to 'section_end', which could be causing 'ending_point' to be incorrect. Additionally, the slicing of the 'docstring' using 'ending_point - 1' could result in an index error if 'ending_point' is -1.

To fix this bug, we can modify the calculation of 'ending_point' and the subsequent slicing of 'docstring' to ensure they handle the case when 'ending_point' is -1.

Here's the corrected code for the 'process_list_block' function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    if ending_point != -1:
        block = docstring[starting_point:ending_point]
        # Place marker for later reinjection.
        docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
        docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                     + docstring_slice
                     + docstring[section_end:])
        lines = block.split('\n')

        # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
        lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]

        # Usually lines have at least 4 additional leading spaces.
        # These have to be removed, but first the list roots have to be detected.
        top_level_regex = r'^    ([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)'
        top_level_replacement = r'- __\1__:\2'
        lines = [re.sub(top_level_regex, top_level_replacement, line) for line in lines]

        # All the other lines get simply the 4 leading space (if present) removed
        lines = [re.sub(r'^    ', '', line) for line in lines]

        # Fix text lines after lists
        indent = 0
        text_block = False
        for i in range(len(lines)):
            line = lines[i]
            spaces = re.search(r'\S', line)
            if spaces:
                # If it is a list element
                if line[spaces.start()] == '-':
                    indent = spaces.start() + 1
                    if text_block:
                        text_block = False
                        lines[i] = '\n' + line
                elif spaces.start() < indent:
                    text_block = True
                    indent = spaces.start()
                    lines[i] = '\n' + line
            else:
                text_block = False
                indent = 0

        block = '\n'.join(lines)

    return docstring, block
```
