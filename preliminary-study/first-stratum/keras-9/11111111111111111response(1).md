The buggy function `process_list_block` has several issues that lead to incorrect behavior and fails the test case. The issues include incorrect replacement of the block in the `docstring_slice`, incorrect manipulation of the `lines` list, and incorrect values in the `block` variable. These issues result in incorrect markdown generation, leading to failing test cases.

To fix the buggy function, the following approach can be taken:
1. Correctly replace the block in `docstring_slice` with the `marker`.
2. Fix the manipulation of the `lines` list to ensure correct formatting.
3. Ensure that the `block` variable contains the correct processed block from the original `docstring`.

Below is the corrected `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:ending_point]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = docstring[:starting_point] + docstring_slice + docstring[section_end:]
    lines = block.split('\n')
    lines = [re.sub(r'^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        if lines[i].strip().startswith('-'):
            lines[i] = '- ' + lines[i].lstrip('- ').strip()
            
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
  
    return docstring, block
```

With these adjustments, the `process_list_block` function should now produce the correct outputs and pass the test case. The `docstring` variable will be correctly formatted, ensuring the expected markdown output matches the actual output.
