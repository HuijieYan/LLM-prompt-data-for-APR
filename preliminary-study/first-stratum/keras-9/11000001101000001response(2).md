The potential error in the code is in the `process_list_block` function. The issue might be with how the ending point is calculated, as well as with the replacement of text in `docstring_slice`.

The bug is likely occurring because the ending_point is calculated incorrectly and may result in a negative value if `'\n\n'` is not found after `starting_point`. Additionally, when replacing the `block` with `marker` in `docstring_slice`, the indices may not be calculated properly.

To fix the bug, the code can be updated to handle the case when `'\n\n'` is not found and properly replace the `block` with `marker` in `docstring_slice`.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    if ending_point == -1:
        ending_point = len(docstring)
    block = docstring[starting_point:ending_point]
    
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[:starting_point] + marker + docstring[section_end:]
    
    lines = block.split('\n')
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    top_level_regex = r'^    ([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)'
    top_level_replacement = r'- __\1__:\2'
    lines = [re.sub(top_level_regex, top_level_replacement, line) for line in lines]
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ', '', line) for line in lines]
    
    indent = 0
    text_block = False
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        spaces = re.search(r'\S', line)
        if spaces:
            if line[spaces.start()] == '-':
                indent = spaces.start() + 1
                if text_block:
                    text_block = False
                    lines[i] = '\n' + line
            elif spaces.start() < indent:
                text_block = True
                indent = spaces.start()
                lines[i] = '\n' + line
        else:
            text_block = False
            indent = 0
    
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring_slice, block
```

This corrected code should handle the cases where `'\n\n'` is not found and properly replace the `block` with `marker` in `docstring_slice`.
