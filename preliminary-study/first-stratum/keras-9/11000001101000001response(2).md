The potential error location in the problematic function is in the `process_list_block` function, particularly in its manipulation of the `ending_point` variable and the subsequent use of `block`.

The bug likely occurs because the calculation of the `ending_point` value does not accurately capture the end of the block, resulting in inaccurate slicing of the `docstring` to obtain the `block`. This affects the subsequent processing and manipulation of the `lines` variable, leading to incorrect handling of list elements and text blocks.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic for calculating the `ending_point` to ensure that it accurately captures the end of the block in the `docstring`. Additionally, we should review the manipulation of the `block` and the subsequent processing of its lines to ensure that list elements and text blocks are properly handled.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_list_block` function:

```python
def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n    ', starting_point)  # Find the next occurrence of '\n    ' after the starting_point
    ending_point = ending_point if ending_point != -1 else section_end  # Use section_end if '\n    ' is not found
    block = docstring[starting_point:ending_point]  # Slice the docstring using the accurate ending_point
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point] + docstring_slice + docstring[section_end:])
    
    lines = block.split('\n')
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)', r'- __\1__:\2', line) for line in lines]
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ', '', line) for line in lines]

    indent = 0
    text_block = False
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        spaces = re.search(r'\S', line)
        if spaces:
            if line[spaces.start()] == '-':
                indent = spaces.start() + 1
                if text_block:
                    text_block = False
                    lines[i] = '\n' + line
            elif spaces.start() < indent:
                text_block = True
                indent = spaces.start()
                lines[i] = '\n' + line
        else:
            text_block = False
            indent = 0
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    
    return docstring, block
```
