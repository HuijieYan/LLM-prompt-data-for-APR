1. The test case is attempting to compare the output of the markdown function with the expected result. The error message suggests that the formatting of the list items in the output is different from the expected formatting.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the part where the list items in the block are being processed and reformatted.

3. The bug occurs because the function is not handling the list items in the block correctly. This results in the formatting of the list items being different from the expected formatting when rendered in markdown.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the list items in the block are processed and reformatted correctly, so that the formatting matches the expected result when rendered in markdown.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else
                                      ending_point - 1)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    # Prepare the list items
    lines = ['- ' + line if line.strip('-') else line for line in lines]
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
```

This corrected code processes each line in the block, and if it is a list item (indicated by the presence of '-'), it adds '- ' at the beginning of the line to ensure consistent formatting.
