The buggy function `process_list_block` is attempting to replace a block of text within the input `docstring` with a `marker` and then further manipulate the lines in the block. However, the code has several issues:
- The replacement of the block with the marker in `docstring_slice` is not correct, leading to incorrect manipulation of the block.
- There is a potential issue in the manipulation of lines in the `block`.

To fix these issues, the following changes should be made to the `process_list_block` function:
1. The use of `.find('\n\n')` should be replaced with `.find('\n\n', starting_point)` to determine the end of the block correctly.
2. The replacement of the block with the marker should be handled more effectively to ensure accurate manipulation.
3. The manipulation of the block to remove leading spaces and create list elements should be performed accurately.

Corrected function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else ending_point - 1)]
    
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    
    lines = block.split('\n')
    
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    
    top_level_regex = r'^    ([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)'
    top_level_replacement = r'- __\1__:\2'
    lines = [re.sub(top_level_regex, top_level_replacement, line) for line in lines]
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ', '', line) for line in lines]
    
    # Fix text lines after lists
    updated_lines = []
    for line in lines:
        if line.startswith('-'):
            updated_lines.append(re.sub(r'^- (.+?):(.*)', r'- __\1__:\2', line))
        else:
            updated_lines.append(line)

    block = '\n'.join(updated_lines)
    
    return docstring, block
```

By making these changes, the function should now effectively replace the block with the marker and manipulate the block's content as intended, leading to accurate handling of the list elements.
