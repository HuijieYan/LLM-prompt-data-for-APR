The bug is in the lines that update the `docstring` and `docstring_slice` variables. The `starting_point` index was not correctly defined, and the replacement with `marker` was being done incorrectly.

The reason for the bug is that the ending_point calculation doesn't cover the case where the '\n\n' is not found. This leads to an incorrect block extraction and replacement.

To fix the bug, the function should explicitly check for the case where the ending_point is not found and update the variables accordingly.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    if ending_point == -1:
        block = docstring[starting_point:]
    else:
        block = docstring[starting_point:ending_point - 1]
    
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = docstring[:starting_point] + docstring_slice + docstring[section_end:]
    
    lines = block.split('\n')
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    top_level_regex = r'^    ([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)'
    top_level_replacement = r'- __\1__:\2'
    lines = [re.sub(top_level_regex, top_level_replacement, line) for line in lines]
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ', '', line) for line in lines]
    indent = 0
    text_block = False
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        spaces = re.search(r'\S', line)
        if spaces:
            if line[spaces.start()] == '-':
                indent = spaces.start() + 1
                if text_block:
                    text_block = False
                    lines[i] = '\n' + line
            elif spaces.start() < indent:
                text_block = True
                indent = spaces.start()
                lines[i] = '\n' + line
        else:
            text_block = False
            indent = 0
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
```
