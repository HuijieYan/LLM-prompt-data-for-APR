1. The test case is failing because the markdown transformation of the returned `docstring` from the function is not matching the expected result. The error message indicates that the bullet points for lists in the `docstring` are not being formatted correctly.

2. The potential error location in the problematic function is during the processing of lists within the docstring.

3. The bug occurs because the function is not correctly transforming the list items in the `docstring` into the target markdown format.

4. One possible approach to fix the bug would be to ensure that the function properly identifies lists in the `docstring` and formats them as markdown bullet points. This involves accurately detecting the list items and transforming them into the correct markdown syntax.

5. Below is the corrected code for the `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else
                                      ending_point - 1)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    # Transform list items into markdown bullet points
    lines = [re.sub(r'^\s*-\s*(.*)', r'- \1', line) for line in lines]
    # Fix text lines after lists
    indent = 0
    text_block = False
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        spaces = re.search(r'\S', line)
        if spaces:
            if line[spaces.start()] == '-':
                indent = spaces.start() + 1
                if text_block:
                    text_block = False
                    lines[i] = '\n' + line
            elif spaces.start() < indent:
                text_block = True
                indent = spaces.start()
                lines[i] = '\n' + line
        else:
            text_block = False
            indent = 0
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
```

In the corrected code, the function now replaces list items with the correct markdown bullet point syntax, addressing the formatting issue.
