The issue appears to be with the `compat_chr` function being used within the `_htmlentity_transform` function. The error message "ValueError: chr() arg not in range(0x110000)" suggests that the argument being passed to `compat_chr` is out of the valid range.

The bug occurs because the `compat_chr` function is likely using Python's built-in `chr` function, which has limits on the range of values it can accept. The value being passed to `compat_chr` is likely exceeding this range, leading to the ValueError.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `_htmlentity_transform` function to handle cases where the value being returned may exceed the range of the `chr` function. To achieve this, we can use the `sys.maxunicode` attribute, which provides the largest Unicode code point. We should also handle the case where the entity value is an integer literal, in which case we should return the corresponding character if it is within the valid range.

Here's the corrected code for the `_htmlentity_transform` function:

```python
import sys

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    
    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        value = int(numstr, base)
        if value < sys.maxunicode:
            return compat_chr(value)
        else:
            return '&#%s;' % numstr

    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```

This modified function checks if the numerical value obtained from the entity is within the valid Unicode range before calling `compat_chr`. If it is within the range, it returns the corresponding character. Otherwise, it returns the entity itself. This should resolve the ValueError reported in the test function.
