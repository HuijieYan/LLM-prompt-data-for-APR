The error is occurring in the `_htmlentity_transform` function when it tries to convert the HTML entity to a character using the `compat_chr` function. The error message `ValueError: unichr() arg not in range(0x110000) (wide Python build)` indicates that the argument provided to `compat_chr` is not in the valid range.

The issue occurs when the input entity is a numeric HTML entity, and it is greater than the maximum allowed Unicode code point (0x10FFFF). The code does not handle this edge case, causing the `compat_chr` function to throw a ValueError.

To fix this issue, the function needs to check whether the numeric entity is within the valid Unicode code point range before trying to convert it using `compat_chr`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import re

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        num = int(numstr, base)
        if 0 <= num <= 0x10FFFF:
            return compat_chr(num)
        else:
            return ('&%s;' % entity)

    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```

In the corrected code, after extracting the numeric value and determining its base, we check if the numeric value is within the valid Unicode code point range (0x0 - 0x10FFFF). If it is within the range, we convert it to a character using `compat_chr`. If it is outside the range, we return the original entity. This fix ensures that the function handles numeric entities that are out of range gracefully.
