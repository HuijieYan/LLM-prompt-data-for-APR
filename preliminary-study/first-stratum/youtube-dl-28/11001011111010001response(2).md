The error message "ValueError: chr() arg not in range(0x110000)" suggests that there is a problem with the character encoding. This error occurs when trying to convert a number to a Unicode character using the `chr()` function, and the number is not within the valid Unicode range (0x0000 to 0x10FFFF).

The potential error in the problematic function is the use of the `compat_chr()` function. This function is likely responsible for converting the numeric values to Unicode characters, and it may not be handling the conversion correctly.

The bug occurs because the `compat_chr()` function does not handle large Unicode code points. The Unicode range for valid characters is from 0x0000 to 0x10FFFF. When the function tries to convert a number outside this range, it raises a ValueError.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `compat_chr()` function can handle large Unicode code points. One possible approach is to use Python's built-in `chr()` function, which can handle a wider range of Unicode code points.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        code_point = int(numstr, base)
        if 0x0000 <= code_point <= 0x10FFFF:
            return chr(code_point)

    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```
