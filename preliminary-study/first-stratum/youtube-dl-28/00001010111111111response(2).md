The error occurs in the `_htmlentity_transform` function where the `compat_chr` function returns a ValueError: unichr() arg not in range(0x110000). This error occurs because the function is trying to return a character that is not in the valid Unicode range.

The potential error lies in the `compat_chr` function or the calculation of `numstr` and `base` in the `_htmlentity_transform` function. The calculation of `numstr` and `base` should be adjusted to ensure that the resulting character falls within the valid Unicode range.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to add a check in the `_htmlentity_transform` function to ensure that the resulting character from the `numstr` and `base` calculation is within the valid Unicode range. If it is not within the valid range, handle it appropriately, such as returning an error message or a default value.

Here's the corrected code for the `_htmlentity_transform` function:

```python
import re

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        
        character_code = int(numstr, base)
        if 0 <= character_code <= 0x10FFFF:  # Check if character code is within valid range
            return compat_chr(character_code)
        else:
            return ''  # Return empty string for characters outside the valid range

    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```

By adding the character code range check, we ensure that the `compat_chr` function doesn't try to handle character codes that are not within the valid Unicode range, thus resolving the ValueError.
