The potential error in the problematic function `_htmlentity_transform` is the use of `compat_chr` to convert the numeric HTML entity to the corresponding character. The error message from the test function suggests that the `chr()` function is receiving a value that is out of its valid range.

The bug is occurring because the `chr()` function in Python expects an integer corresponding to a Unicode code point as an argument. If the numeric HTML entity provided to the function represents a character that is outside the valid Unicode range, the `chr()` function will raise a `ValueError`.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to handle the case where the numeric HTML entity represents a character outside the valid Unicode range. One approach to handle this is to use the `unescape` function available in the `html` module, which can correctly handle numeric HTML entities.

Here's the corrected code for the `_htmlentity_transform` function:

```python
from html import unescape

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    
    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        try:
            return compat_chr(int(numstr, base))
        except ValueError:
            return unescape('&#' + numstr + ';')

    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```

With this modification, the function should be able to handle both known and unknown numeric HTML entities correctly and prevent the `ValueError` that was occurring previously.
