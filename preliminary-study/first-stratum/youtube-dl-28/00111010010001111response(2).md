The error is occurring in the `_htmlentity_transform` function when it attempts to convert the entity value into a character. The error message indicates that the `unichr()` function is receiving an argument that is not within the acceptable range.

The issue is likely due to incorrect conversion of the entity value to a character, resulting in a character that is outside of the Unicode range.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the entity value exceeds the range of Unicode characters. One approach is to check if the converted character falls within the valid Unicode range and if not, return the literal representation of the entity.

Here's the corrected code for the `_htmlentity_transform` function:

```python
import re

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        codepoint = int(numstr, base)
        if codepoint < 0 or codepoint > 0x10FFFF:  # Check if the codepoint is within valid Unicode range
            return ('&%s;' % entity)  # Return the literal representation of the entity if outside range
        else:
            return compat_chr(codepoint)

    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```

With this correction, the function now checks if the converted codepoint falls within the valid Unicode range and returns the literal representation if it doesn't. This should resolve the "ValueError: unichr() arg not in range(0x110000)" issue.
