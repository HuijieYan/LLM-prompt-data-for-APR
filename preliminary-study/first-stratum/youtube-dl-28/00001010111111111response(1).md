The error occurs in the `_htmlentity_transform` function when it tries to convert the HTML entity `#2013266066` to a character using the `compat_chr` function, which then calls `unichr`. The error message "ValueError: chr() arg not in range(0x110000)" indicates that the value passed to `chr` is out of range, likely because the numeric value `2013266066` is too large.

To fix this bug, we need to handle large numeric values more effectively and make sure that the values are within the valid range for character representation.

Here's the corrected code for the `_htmlentity_transform` function:

```python
import re

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        num = int(numstr, 16 if numstr.startswith('x') else 10)
        if 0 <= num <= 0x10FFFF:
            return compat_chr(num)
        else:
            # Handle out-of-range numeric values
            return ''
    else:
        # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
        return ('&%s;' % entity)
```

In the fixed code:
1. We have updated the logic to extract the numeric value from the entity and check if it is within the valid range for Unicode characters.
2. If the value is within the valid range, we use `compat_chr` to convert it to a character. If the value is out of range, we return an empty string.
3. For unknown entities, we return their literal representation.

With these changes, the function should now be able to handle both small and large numeric values within the valid range for character representation.
