The error occurs due to the usage of `compat_chr` function, which tries to convert a Unicode code point to a string. The error message indicates that the argument passed to `compat_chr` is not in the valid range.

It is likely that the issue is with the values of `numstr` and `base` when the function tries to convert the HTML entity to a character.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `numstr` is within the valid range for the given `base`.

Below is the corrected code for the `_htmlentity_transform` function:

```python
import re

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity]

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = numstr[1:]  # remove the 'x'
        else:
            base = 10

        num = int(numstr, base)
        if 0 <= num <= 0x10FFFF:  # Unicode valid range
            return chr(num)
        else:
            raise ValueError("Character code out of range.")

    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```

This fixes the bug by ensuring that the `numstr` is converted to a valid Unicode character code within the valid range based on the specified `base`. If the code point is out of range, it raises a `ValueError` indicating that the character code is out of range.
