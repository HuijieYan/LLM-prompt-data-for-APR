Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the `if mobj is not None` condition, where the base is assigned a value based on whether `numstr` starts with 'x' or not.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug is likely occurring because the code incorrectly assumes that `numstr` starts with 'x' if it's a hexadecimal value, leading to incorrect base conversion.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Instead of checking whether `numstr` starts with 'x' to determine the base, it's better to use a regular expression to identify the base and then convert the value accordingly.

Corrected code:

```python
import re

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    
    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj:
        base = 16 if mobj.group(1).startswith('x') else 10
        return compat_chr(int(mobj.group(1), base))

    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```

In the corrected code, instead of relying on `numstr` to determine the base, a regular expression is used to directly identify the base and convert the value accordingly. This should address the issue and provide the expected behavior.
