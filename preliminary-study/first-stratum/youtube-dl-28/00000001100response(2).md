The issue in the provided code is that it is trying to convert a large number to a character using `compat_chr` function, which causes a `ValueError` because the value is not in the valid range for character conversion.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import codecs
import html.entities

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    try:
        # Check if entity is a known HTML entity
        if entity in html.entities.name2codepoint:
            return chr(html.entities.name2codepoint[entity])
        
        # Check if entity is a numeric HTML entity
        if entity.startswith('x'):
            return chr(int(entity[1:], 16))
        else:
            return chr(int(entity))
    except (ValueError, OverflowError):
        return entity
```

With this corrected function, the `ValueError` when converting a large number to a character should no longer occur.
