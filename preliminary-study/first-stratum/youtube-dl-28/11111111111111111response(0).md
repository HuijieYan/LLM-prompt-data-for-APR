The error is occurring in the `_htmlentity_transform` function, which is used to transform an HTML entity to a character. The error message "ValueError: chr() arg not in range(0x110000)" is raised when trying to convert a number to a character, which indicates that the input number is out of the valid range.

The issue seems to be with the handling of non-numeric HTML entities in the `_htmlentity_transform` function. When encountering non-numeric HTML entities, the function should return the literal representation of the entity, but it does not appear to be doing so. This results in the numeric transformation being attempted on non-numeric entities, leading to the ValueError.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle non-numeric HTML entities in the `htmlentity_transform` function and return their literal representation.

Here's the corrected code for the `_htmlentity_transform` function:

```python
import re

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """
    Transforms an HTML entity to a character.
    """

    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    if re.match(r'^#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+);$', entity):
        numstr = entity.lstrip('#x')
        if numstr.isdigit():
            base = 10
        else:
            base = 16
        try:
            return compat_chr(int(numstr, base))
        except ValueError:
            pass

    return '&{};'.format(entity)
```

In the corrected code:
1. We check if the entity matches the pattern for HTML entities starting with '#' and containing either hexadecimal or decimal numbers.
2. If a match is found, we extract the numeric part of the entity and determine the base for conversion (either base 10 for decimal or base 16 for hexadecimal).
3. We then attempt to convert the numeric part to a character using the determined base. If successful, the character is returned.
4. If any step fails (e.g., invalid input or conversion), we fall back to returning the original HTML entity with '&' and ';' added.

This approach ensures that both numeric and non-numeric HTML entities are handled correctly, preventing the ValueError described in the issue.
