## Analysis
The error occurs when the function `unescapeHTML` tries to unescape the HTML entity `&#2013266066;` in the test case. This entity is converted to a number and then to a Unicode character using the `chr()` function, which raises a `ValueError` due to the argument being out of range for the `chr()` function in a wide Python build.

## Potential Error Location
The potential error location is likely within the `_htmlentity_transform` function, specifically when it attempts to convert the numeric HTML entity to a character using the `compat_chr()` function.

## Reasons for the Bug
The bug occurs because the function does not check whether the numeric entity is within the valid Unicode range before converting it to a character. This results in an out-of-range argument being passed to the `compat_chr()` function, leading to a `ValueError`.

## Possible Approaches
1. Check if the numeric entity falls within the valid Unicode range before converting it to a character.
2. Handle out-of-range cases gracefully, for example by returning a default character or representing the out-of-range entity differently.
3. Use a different approach to handle numeric HTML entities that may be out of range for the `chr()` function in wide Python builds.

## Corrected Code
```python
import re
import html.entities

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    if entity in html.entities.name2codepoint:
        return chr(html.entities.name2codepoint[entity])
    
    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        try:
            if numstr.startswith('x'):
                num = int(numstr[1:], 16)
            else:
                num = int(numstr, 10)
        
            if 0 <= num <= 0x10FFFF:
                return chr(num)
            else:
                # Handle out-of-range case gracefully
                return 'Out-of-range'
        except ValueError:
            # Handle invalid number format
            return 'Invalid numeric entity format'

    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```
In the corrected code:
- The `html.entities` module is used to access the `name2codepoint` dictionary directly.
- The numeric conversion is now guarded by a check to ensure the number is within the valid Unicode range (0 - 0x10FFFF).
- Out-of-range and invalid format cases are handled gracefully, returning specified strings to indicate these exceptional cases.

These changes ensure that the function handles numeric HTML entities appropriately and avoids passing out-of-range arguments to the `chr()` function.
