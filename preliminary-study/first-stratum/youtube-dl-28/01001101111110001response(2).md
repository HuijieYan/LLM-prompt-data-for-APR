The error message "ValueError: chr() arg not in range(0x110000)" is likely occurring because the `chr()` function is receiving an argument that is not within the valid Unicode range. This indicates that the function `_htmlentity_transform` is not correctly handling the transformation of HTML entities to characters.

The potential error location within the function is likely in the part that handles numeric HTML entities, specifically the usage of the `compat_chr` function.

The bug occurs because the function is not correctly handling the hexadecimal numeric HTML entities. It also does not consider the Unicode limit when converting the numeric HTML entities to characters.

To fix the bug, the function `_htmlentity_transform` needs to be updated to properly handle both decimal and hexadecimal representations of HTML entities and ensure that the resulting character is within the valid Unicode range.

Here's the corrected code for the `_htmlentity_transform` function:

```python
import re
import html.entities

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """
    Transforms an HTML entity to a character.
    """

    try:
        if entity.startswith('&#x'):
            char_code = int(entity[3:-1], 16)
        elif entity.startswith('&#'):
            char_code = int(entity[2:-1])
        else:
            char_code = html.entities.name2codepoint[entity]

        if char_code < 0x110000:
            return chr(char_code)
        else:
            return entity
    except (ValueError, KeyError):
        return '&' + entity + ';'
```

In this corrected code:
- We first check if the entity is a numeric entity in decimal or hexadecimal format.
- We then convert the entity to a character using `chr()` if it's within the valid Unicode range.
- If the entity is not within the valid range or is not recognized, we return the original entity wrapped in `&` and `;`.
