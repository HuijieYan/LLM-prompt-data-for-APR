The error message "ValueError: chr() arg not in range(0x110000)" indicates that the `chr()` function is receiving an argument that is not within the valid Unicode range. This suggests that the issue may be related to the conversion of HTML entities to characters using the `chr()` function.

The bug in the `_htmlentity_transform` function likely arises from the fact that it is not properly handling certain HTML entities, leading to incorrect conversion or an attempt to convert invalid numeric entities.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated to properly handle both named and numeric HTML entities. Additionally, it should handle cases where the numeric value of an HTML entity is not within the valid Unicode range.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
import html.entities as compat_html_entities
import re

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """
    Transforms an HTML entity to a character.
    """

    # Known named HTML entity
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'&#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+);', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        base = 16 if numstr.startswith('x') else 10
        try:
            codepoint = int(numstr, base)
            if codepoint < 0x110000:  # Check if codepoint is within valid Unicode range
                return chr(codepoint)
            else:
                return ('&%s;' % numstr)  # Return the entity if codepoint is out of range
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            return ('&%s;' % numstr)  # Return the entity if conversion fails

    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```

In this corrected function:
- We import `html.entities` to access the named HTML entities and use the `chr()` function for conversion.
- We use a regular expression to match and extract numeric entities (both decimal and hexadecimal) and then convert them to Unicode code points. We also handle cases where the code point is out of range or conversion fails.
- The function now properly handles both named and numeric HTML entities, ensuring that the output is within the valid Unicode range.
