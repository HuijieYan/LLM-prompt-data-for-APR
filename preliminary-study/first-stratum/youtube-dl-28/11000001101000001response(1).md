The potential error location within the problematic function is the regex pattern used to match the numeric HTML entity. The bug is likely occurring because the regex pattern is incorrect, which is causing the function to return unexpected results for the numeric HTML entities.

The bug is occurring because the regex pattern used to match the numeric HTML entity is not correctly capturing the value following the '#' symbol. As a result, the function is unable to properly convert the HTML entity to its corresponding character.

To fix the bug, the regex pattern used to match the numeric HTML entity should be updated to correctly capture the value following the '#' symbol. Additionally, the conversion logic for the HTML entities should be reviewed to ensure that the correct output is returned for both numeric and non-numeric entities.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'&(#[0-9]+;|#[xX][0-9a-fA-F]+;)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        
        # Detect hexadecimal format
        if numstr.lower().startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = numstr[1:-1]
        else:
            base = 10
            numstr = numstr[1:-1]
            
        return compat_chr(int(numstr, base))

    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```
