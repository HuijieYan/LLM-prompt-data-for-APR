The error message "ValueError: chr() arg not in range(0x110000)" indicates that the chr() function is receiving an argument that is outside the valid Unicode code point range.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the section where it attempts to transform a numeric entity (e.g., '&#x2F;' or '&#47;') into a character using the compat_chr() function.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code does not handle cases where the numeric entity exceeds the valid Unicode code point range.

To fix the bug, you can add a check to ensure that the numeric entity is within the valid Unicode code point range before converting it into a character.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re
import html.entities as compat_html_entities

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """
    Transforms an HTML entity to a character.
    """

    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        code_point = int(numstr, base)

        if 0 <= code_point <= 0x10FFFF:
            return chr(code_point)
        else:
            return ('&%s;' % entity)

    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```

In the corrected code, after extracting the code point from the numeric entity, we added a check to ensure that the code point is within the valid Unicode code point range (0 to 0x10FFFF). If the code point is within the range, we convert it to a character using the chr() function. If the code point is outside the range, we return the original numeric entity.
