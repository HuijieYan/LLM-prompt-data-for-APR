The potential error in the function `_htmlentity_transform` is in the part where it checks for known non-numeric HTML entities and tries to return the corresponding character. It looks for the entity in the `compat_html_entities.name2codepoint` dictionary, but it does not handle the case when the entity is not found in the dictionary.

The bug occurs because if the entity is not found in the dictionary, the function simply returns the entity enclosed in `&` and `;`. This is incorrect behavior, as the function should return the literal representation of the entity in this case.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when the entity is not found in the dictionary and return its literal representation.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])
    
    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        return compat_chr(int(numstr, base))

    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```

With this fix, the function will now return the literal representation of the entity when it is not found in the dictionary. This should resolve the bug and handle all cases mentioned in the provided test function.
