The potential error location within the problematic function is the regex match condition for checking the format of the entity. The bug occurs because the regex pattern used in the function does not cover the case where the entity starts with 'x' followed by an alphanumeric character.

To fix this bug, the regex pattern should be updated to cover the case where the entity starts with 'x' followed by an alphanumeric character.

```python
import re

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    
    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0'+numstr[1:]
        else:
            base = 10
        return compat_chr(int(numstr, base))

    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```

With the updated regex pattern, the function should now be able to correctly handle both cases, where the entity starts with 'x' followed by an alphanumeric character, and where it is just a numeric value.
