The error message "KeyError: None" suggests that there is an issue with a key being None in the pivot function, which is causing the KeyError.

The issue in the pivot function seems to be with the handling of the `values` parameter and the creation of the MultiIndex when `values` is not None.

The bug occurs because when `values` is not None, the function tries to create a MultiIndex using the `index` and `columns` from the input data. However, there is an issue with how the MultiIndex is created and assigned to the `index` variable.

To fix the bug, the function should handle the MultiIndex creation and assignment more carefully. Additionally, checks should be put in place to handle cases where `values` is None and `index` or `columns` is also None.

Here's the corrected code for the pivot function:

```python
from pandas import DataFrame, MultiIndex
import pandas as pd

def pivot(data: "DataFrame", index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> "DataFrame":
    if values is None:
        cols = [columns] if index is None else [index, columns]
        append = index is None
        indexed = data.set_index(cols, append=append)
    else:
        if index is None:
            index = data.index
        else:
            index = data[index]
        columns = data[columns]

        if isinstance(values, str):
            indexed = data.pivot(index=index, columns=columns, values=values)
        else:
            indexed = data.pivot_table(index=index, columns=columns, values=values)

    return indexed
```

The corrected function handles the creation of the MultiIndex and also correctly uses the `pivot` or `pivot_table` method of the DataFrame based on the type of `values`.
