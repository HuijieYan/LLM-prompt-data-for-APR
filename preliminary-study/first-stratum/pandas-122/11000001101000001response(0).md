The buggy function `equals` is designed to check if two BlockManager objects are equal. However, there are several issues present in the code:

1. There are multiple definitions of the `canonicalize` function, which can cause confusion and errors.

2. The `equal` method contains a call to a method `_consolidate_inplace()` which is not defined in the context of the given function.

3. The sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function seems redundant and prone to errors.

4. The structure of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` should be handled more carefully as they contain the actual data blocks.

To fix these issues, the following changes should be made:

- Rename one of the `canonicalize` functions to avoid naming conflicts.

- Update the function to no longer call `_consolidate_inplace()` method.

- Instead of sorting the entire blocks, create a custom comparison logic for the block data in the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` tuples.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Assuming self.blocks and other.blocks are tuples of block data
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Custom comparison logic for the block data
    for i, block in enumerate(self.blocks):
        if not block.equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False
    
    return True
```

This code addresses the issues mentioned and provides a more robust logic for comparing the block data within the BlockManager objects.
