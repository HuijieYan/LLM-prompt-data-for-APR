The buggy function `equals` is supposed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` and determine whether they are equal. The function seems to be failing while performing this comparison.

The potential error location is in the comparison logic inside the `equals` function, as it is not comparing the actual elements of the data frame correctly. The comparison logic also tries to sort the blocks within the two `BlockManager` objects using the `canonicalize` function, but it doesn't handle the different types of blocks properly.

The bug occurs because the comparison logic is not correctly handling the different types of blocks within the `BlockManager`. Additionally, the comparison is entirely based on sorting the blocks, which may not always be the correct approach for comparing two `BlockManager` instances.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to modify the comparison logic to properly compare the individual elements of the `BlockManager` objects instead of just sorting and comparing the blocks. The `canonicalize` function needs to be modified to appropriately handle the different types of blocks.

Here is the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Compare individual blocks based on their content
    self_blocks_content = [block.values for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks_content = [block.values for block in other.blocks]
    return all(
        np.array_equal(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks_content, other_blocks_content)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the comparison logic has been modified to compare the individual blocks based on their content using the `np.array_equal` function. This ensures a proper comparison of the actual data within the `BlockManager` instances.
