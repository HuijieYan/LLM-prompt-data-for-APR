The error occurs in the `equals` function. The specific issue is that the function does not properly handle the case where the dataframes have the same columns but the data types within the columns are different.

The function does not account for the data type in the comparison between the data blocks. It assumes that the blocks being compared are of the same data type, and in case this assumption is violated, it will result in a comparison failure.

To fix the bug, the `equals` function needs to explicitly handle the comparison of data blocks with different data types. This can be achieved by first checking the data type of the blocks being compared and then performing the appropriate comparison based on the data types.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for i, block in enumerate(self_blocks):
        if block.dtype != other_blocks[i].dtype:
            return False
        if not block.equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected code explicitly checks the data type of the blocks being compared and performs appropriate comparisons based on the data types. This should resolve the issue observed in the test case.
