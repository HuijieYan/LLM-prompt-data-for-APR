The error seems to be occurring in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. The method is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` objects, but it is not handling the comparison correctly.

The error message from the test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` shows that the `equals` method is returning `True` when it should return `False`. The actual and expected DataFrames are not equal, so the assertion fails.

The potential error location is likely in the logic of the `equals` method, where the comparison between the two `BlockManager` objects is not being performed correctly.

One approach to fixing the bug is to correct the comparison logic within the `equals` method. The comparison logic should properly compare the attributes and blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects. Additionally, any operations such as sorting or consolidation should be performed before the comparison to ensure accurate results.

Here is the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Consolidate inplace before comparison
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected code:
- The `equals` method ensures that the axes are compared first, and then consolidation is performed on both objects before comparing their blocks.
- We use a `canonicalize` function to ensure a consistent order for the blocks before comparison.
- The return statement at the end compares each block from `self` with the corresponding block from `other`, ensuring that they are all equal.

By implementing these changes, the `equals` method should now correctly compare `BlockManager` objects and return the expected results.
