The error message indicates that the `equals` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`.

The potential error in the function is the use of `block` in the `canonicalize` function. In the buggy code, `block` is used without being defined locally. It is assumed to be a global variable, which leads to unexpected behavior when sorting the `blocks` in the `equals` method.

The buggy function assumes that the `block` variable is defined globally, which is not the case. The corrected code should ensure that `block` is properly defined within the `canonicalize` function.

To fix the bug, you can modify the `canonicalize` function to take a `block` as a parameter and return the appropriate tuple. Then, in the `equals` method, you can call the `canonicalize` function with the `block` parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
