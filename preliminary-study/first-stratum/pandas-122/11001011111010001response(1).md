The issue lies within the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class. The function compares two `BlockManager` instances, but it fails because the order of the columns in the dataframes `df1` and `df2` are different.

The error message indicates that the `equals` method is being called on a dataframe that's being compared to the dataframe `df1`, which results in erroneous comparison and the assertion failure.

To fix the issue, we need to modify the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class to account for different column orders when comparing dataframes.

Here's the corrected `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_sorted_columns = sorted(self.columns)
    other_sorted_columns = sorted(other.columns)
    if self_sorted_columns != other_sorted_columns:
        return False

    return self.equals(other)
```

The corrected method first sorts the columns of both dataframes and then compares them to ensure that the order of the columns does not affect the comparison result. By implementing this change, the function should correctly compare the dataframes and return the expected results.
