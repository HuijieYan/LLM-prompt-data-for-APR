1. The test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` is designed to check if the `equals` method correctly returns `False` when comparing two DataFrames with different data. The error message shows that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing, as it is evaluating to `True` instead of `False`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the implementation of the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. The logic for comparing the blocks might not be correctly identifying when two DataFrames are not equal, leading to the incorrect output.

3. The bug occurs because the `equals` function is not correctly comparing the contents of the two DataFrames. The method is missing a proper logic to compare the data within the blocks of the DataFrames, leading to incorrect results.

4. To fix the bug, the `equals` method needs to be updated to compare the values within the blocks of the DataFrames and properly handle the situation where identical blocks have different locations.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._consolidate_inplace(), block.values)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By properly utilizing the `_consolidate_inplace` method and comparing the block values, the `equals` method should now correctly identify when two DataFrames are not equal.
