The bug is related to the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. The error occurs when trying to determine if two DataFrames are equal. The function mistakenly returns True when two identical blocks with different locations are compared.

The bug is most likely occurring within the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class due to mishandling of block locations during comparison.

To fix the bug, the `equals` method needs to be modified to correctly handle the comparison of identical blocks with different locations. This can be achieved by updating the logic that compares the blocks to compare based on content rather than block location.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort the blocks to compare based on content rather than block location
    self_blocks_sorted = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values)
    other_blocks_sorted = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values)

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks_sorted, other_blocks_sorted))
```

By sorting the blocks based on their values, the corrected function will accurately compare the content of the blocks rather than their locations, addressing the bug.
