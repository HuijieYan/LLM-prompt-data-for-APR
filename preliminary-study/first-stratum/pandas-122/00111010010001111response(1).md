The error message indicates that the `equals` method is returning True when it should actually return False. This is unexpected behavior and needs to be fixed.

The potential error in the `equals` method may be due to the comparison of the blocks inside the method. It seems that the block comparison is not taking into account the order or location of the blocks and is incorrectly returning True even when the block locations are different.

The bug occurs because the method is not correctly handling the comparison of blocks with different locations in the two DataFrames, causing incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the `equals` method should be modified to properly take into account the block locations of the DataFrames when comparing the blocks for equality.

Here's the corrected `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.values))
```

This modification to the function takes the locations of the blocks into account by sorting them based on the block data type and their values. This ensures that the comparison considers the block locations, thereby fixing the bug.

After making this change, the `equals` method should correctly identify when DataFrames with identical blocks in different locations are not equal.
