Here's the corrected implementation of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    # Check if axes are equal
    if self.axes != other.axes:
        return False
    
    # Check if blocks are equal
    if self.blocks != other.blocks:
        return False
    
    # Check any other relevant properties for equality
    
    return True  # If all checks pass, the objects are equal
```

In this corrected function, the equality of the `BlockManager` objects is determined by comparing the axes and blocks attributes. After implementing the corrections, the `equals` function should be able to accurately determine the equality of `BlockManager` objects.
