The error occurs because the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class is not implemented correctly. The method compares two `BlockManager` objects, specifically their axes, blocks, and consolidated state.

The comparison logic inside the `equals` method is faulty. It incorrectly compares the axes, consolidates the blocks inplace, sorts the blocks, and then compares the sorted blocks, but there are discrepancies in how the comparison is done, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, the comparison logic inside the `equals` method needs to be revised. The comparison should take into account the axes, block contents, and consolidated state of the two `BlockManager` objects.

Additionally, the logic for consolidating the blocks inplace should be reviewed to ensure that it is performed correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    for i in range(len(self_axes)):
        if not self_axes[i].equals(other_axes[i]):
            return False

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected code compares the axes and blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects and also ensures that their blocks are consolidated before comparison.
