The error occurs in the `equals` function of the `DataFrame` class. The `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` expression in the test case fails, indicating that the `equals` method is returning `True` when it should return `False`.

The reason for this bug is that the `equals` method is not properly comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. This causes it to return `True` erroneously.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic within the `equals` method to ensure that it correctly compares DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations and returns `False` in such cases.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
# signature of a relative function in this class
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected method now properly handles comparisons of DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations, ensuring that it returns the correct result.
