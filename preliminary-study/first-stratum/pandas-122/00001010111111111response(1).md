The error occurs in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. The method is not correctly comparing the blocks' data. This is resulting in the method returning `True` when it should return `False`.

The issue seems to be related to a bug in the way the `equals` method compares the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances.

To fix this bug, the `equals` method should be updated to properly compare the blocks, taking into account their data and positions, rather than returning `True` when the blocks are identical irrespective of their positions.

The corrected `equals` method for the `BlockManager` class is as follows:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    for block1, block2 in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not block1.equals(block2):
            return False

    return True
```

This updated `equals` method compares all the blocks in the two `BlockManager` instances and returns `False` if any of the blocks are not equal. Otherwise, it returns `True`. This should resolve the issue with the incorrect comparison in the original `equals` method.
