The buggy function is `equals`. It compares two `BlockManager` objects by comparing their axes and blocks. It then tries to consolidate the blocks and compare them, but it has an issue in the way it does the comparison.

The error message indicates that the `equals` method is being called on the DataFrame objects `df1` and `df2`, which then calls the `equals` method on the underlying BlockManager objects. This leads to the error because the comparison done in the `equals` method is not correct.

The bug is in the comparison of the blocks. The comparison method used to compare the blocks is not well-defined and is leading to incorrect results when the test case is run.

To fix the bug:
1. We need to ensure that the comparison of blocks is done correctly. One approach could be to compare the values in the blocks directly, taking into account the index and column labels to ensure proper alignment.
2. We can also ensure that the blocks are properly consolidated before comparison to avoid any inconsistencies in the comparison process.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def compare_blocks(block1, block2):
        # Compare the values in the blocks, taking into account index and column labels
        return block1.values.equals(block2.values) and block1.index.equals(block2.index) and block1.columns.equals(block2.columns)

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(compare_blocks(block1, block2) for block1, block2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In this corrected code, the `compare_blocks` function ensures that the block comparison is done correctly by comparing the values, index, and columns of the blocks. Additionally, the `self._consolidate_inplace()` call was kept to ensure that the blocks are properly consolidated before comparison.
