The error message is indicating that the `equals` method of the two dataframes is not returning False as expected.

The potential error location within the `equals` method of the given code is that the comparison logic for the dataframes is flawed, leading to incorrect results.

The bug occurs because the `equals` method is not properly consolidating the dataframes and comparing them. It is also not correctly handling the comparison of the blocks within the dataframes.

One approach to fixing the bug is to ensure that both dataframes are consolidated before comparison. Then, the blocks within the dataframes need to be sorted and compared appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if self is other:
        return True
    if not isinstance(other, BlockManager):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if self.axes.equals(other.axes):
        for self_block, other_block in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
            if not self_block.equals(other_block):
                return False
        return True
        
    return False
```

The corrected code ensures that both dataframes are consolidated before comparison. It then iterates through the blocks within the dataframes, comparing them one by one. If all comparisons are true, the method returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
