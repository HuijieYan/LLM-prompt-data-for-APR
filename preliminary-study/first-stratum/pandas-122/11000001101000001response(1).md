The problem seems to be in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The function should compare two instances of `BlockManager` and their underlying blocks to check if they are equal.

The error in the `equals` function is caused by a discrepancy between the dtype of the blocks in the `self` and `other` instances, which are being incorrectly compared. The function should take into consideration the values of the blocks rather than their type. 

One possible approach to fixing this bug is to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the values of the blocks rather than just their types. This can be achieved by obtaining the values of the blocks and using them in the canonicalization process.

Here's the corrected function code:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, values, and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype, block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With these corrections, the function will compare the dtype, values, and mgr_locs of the blocks to determine equality, leading to a more accurate comparison of the `BlockManager` instances.
