The buggy function 'equals' is part of the pandas library and is used to compare two instances of the BlockManager class. The function first compares the axes and blocks of the two instances, and then sorts and compares the blocks individually.

The potential error in the function lies in the comparison of blocks. It appears that the function is not handling the case where blocks are of different types or contain different types of data. This can lead to incorrect comparisons and return incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the function should compare blocks based on their data type. Additionally, it should also handle the case when blocks contain different data types. One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the comparison logic to handle different data types and ensure that comparisons are done appropriately for each data type.

Here's the corrected code for the 'equals' function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
