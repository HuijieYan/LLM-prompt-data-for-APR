The test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` compares two dataframes `df1` and `df2` and expects them to be not equal. The error message indicates that the `equals` method is returning `True` instead of `False`.

The buggy function is the `equals` method provided in the source code, as it is the method being called by the test case.

There are a few potential reasons behind the bug:
1. The comparison logic in the `equals` method might be flawed, leading to incorrect results.
2. There could be an issue with data type handling within the `equals` method.

To fix the bug, the `equals` method should be modified to correctly compare the two dataframes `self` and `other` and return the expected result.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=self.canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=other.canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected method addresses potential issues in the original implementation and should return the correct comparison result for the provided test case and similar scenarios.
