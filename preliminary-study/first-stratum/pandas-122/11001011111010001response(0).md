The error in the `equals` method is due to the incorrect comparison of two DataFrames. The method is incorrectly returning `True` for DataFrames that are not equal, leading to the assertion error in the test function.

The potential error in the code is the logic within the `equals` method that compares the DataFrames block by block and uses the `_consolidate_inplace` method to ensure all blocks are consolidated before the comparison. It also uses a `canonicalize` function to order the blocks before comparison.

The reason behind the bug is that the code does not handle cases where the DataFrames have the same column and index names but different data types or different values within the columns.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic should also take into account the data types of the columns and the actual values within the columns. Additionally, the handling of unconsolidated blocks should be improved.

Below is the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if self.index.equals(other.index) and self.columns.equals(other.columns):
        for col in self.columns:
            if self[col].dtype != other[col].dtype:
                return False
            if not self[col].equals(other[col]):
                return False
        return True
    else:
        return False
```
