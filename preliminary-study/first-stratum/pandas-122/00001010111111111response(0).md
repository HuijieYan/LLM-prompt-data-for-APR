The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The `equals` function incorrectly returns `True` when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. This is due to the fact that the function does not properly handle the comparison of blocks with different locations.

The `equals` function should be modified to properly compare the blocks in the DataFrames, taking into account their locations.

Here's the corrected `equals` function for the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Reordering the blocks by type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This updated `equals` function properly compares the blocks of the DataFrames, taking into account their locations, and returns the correct result when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
