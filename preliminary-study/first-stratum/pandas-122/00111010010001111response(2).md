The bug in the code seems to be related to the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class. The `equals` method is used to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks.

The issue seems to stem from the comparison of the blocks in the `equals` method. The method incorrectly identifies identical blocks with different locations as being unequal. This is because it compares the blocks directly, without taking into account their location.

To fix this bug, one possible approach is to modify the comparison process for the blocks. Instead of comparing the blocks directly, the comparison should take into account the block type, dtype, and their corresponding data. Additionally, the comparison should also consider the block location.

The corrected code for the `equals` method could look something like this:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.dtype.name, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code includes a `canonicalize` function that generates a unique representation for each block based on its type, dtype, and values. The comparison now takes into account this canonical representation and performs a comparison based on the canonicalized blocks.

With this approach, the `equals` method should be able to correctly identify equal blocks with different locations and return the expected result.
