1. The test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` is expecting `df1.equals(df2)` to return False, but it's currently returning True.

2. The potential error location within the `equals` function is the way the `block` objects are being canonicalized and compared. Also, the `canonicalize` function is defined within the `equals` function, which may not be intended.

3. The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function is defined within the `equals` function but is intended to be a separate method. This leads to incorrect comparison of block objects, causing `equals` to return True when it should be False.

4. One approach to fixing the bug would be to properly define the `canonicalize` function as a separate method within the class and make sure it correctly handles the `block` objects. Then update the `equals` function to use this `canonicalize` method for comparison.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# corrected equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=self._canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=other._canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )

# separate canonicalize method
def _canonicalize(self, block):
    return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
```

By defining the `canonicalize` method as a separate method within the class and updating the `equals` function to use this method, we fix the bug and ensure correct comparison of block objects.
