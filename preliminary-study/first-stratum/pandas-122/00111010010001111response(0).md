The bug in the `equals` method arises from the sorting of the blocks based on their type and location, leading to incorrect comparison of the DataFrame objects. The bug seems to occur because the `canonicalize` function is not properly implemented, and the comparison of blocks is not correct.

To fix this bug, the `equals` method should be updated to properly compare the blocks in a DataFrame. The `canonicalize` function should be reimplemented to provide a consistent way to identify and sort the blocks. Additionally, the comparison logic within the `equals` method should be updated to correctly compare the sorted blocks between the DataFrames.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._block_type, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code addresses the inconsistencies in block comparison and sorting, improving the accuracy of the `equals` method when comparing two DataFrames.
