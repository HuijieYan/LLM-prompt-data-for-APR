The issue is with the `equals()` method of the `BlockManager` class. When comparing two dataframes using the `equals()` method, it wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals()` method to correctly compare the blocks and return the appropriate result. We can modify the `equals()` method to compare each block of the dataframes individually and return `False` if any of the blocks are not equal.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals()` method of the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    for self_block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not (self_block.equals(other_block)):
            return False
    
    return True
```

This modified code compares the axes and the blocks of the two dataframes and returns `False` if any of the comparisons fail, ensuring that the `equals()` method returns the correct result.

With this modification, the issue where the `equals()` method wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations will be resolved.
