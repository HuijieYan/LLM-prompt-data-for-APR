The error occurs in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles indentation and comments. The function processes the input prefix character by character, building lines and checking for the indentation level. It then returns the processed lines and the remaining prefix. This function is used in the context of reformatting code, specifically in the context of handling comments.

The bug occurs when the function encounters a comment at a lower indentation level. It doesn't correctly handle the indentation of the comment. As a result, the test case `test_comment_indentation` fails with an assertion error, indicating that the expected output doesn't match the actual output.

To fix this bug, the function needs to correctly handle the indentation of comments. Specifically, it should ensure that the comments are correctly aligned based on the overall indentation of the code. This may involve tracking the current level of indentation and adjusting the comments accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected code, I have added a condition for a newline character outside the `wait_for_nl` condition to ensure that the current line is properly handled whenever a newline character is encountered.

This should resolve the issue and ensure that comments are correctly indented based on the overall code indentation.
