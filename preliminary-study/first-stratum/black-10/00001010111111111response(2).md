The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix string up to a certain column position, as specified by the `column` parameter. However, the implementation has some issues:

1. The `wait_for_nl` flag is not being properly updated. This leads to improper handling of newline characters and affects the indentation logic.
2. The logic for calculating the indentation level is incorrect, as it does not account for the number of spaces and tabs correctly.

In the test function `test_comment_indentation`, the error message indicates that the indentation is being changed incorrectly for tabulated comments after a dedent.

To fix the bug, the following approaches can be taken:
1. Properly update the `wait_for_nl` flag to ensure correct handling of newline characters.
2. Update the logic for calculating the indentation level to account for the number of spaces and tabs correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl and char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming 4 spaces per tab, can be adjusted depending on the tab width
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code properly updates the `wait_for_nl` flag and adjusts the logic for calculating the indentation level to handle both spaces and tabs accurately.
