The bug seems to be related to the handling of indentation for comments after a dedent. It looks like the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not correctly handling the indentation of comments after a dedent, which is causing the incorrect formatting.

The main reason for the bug is that the function is not properly tracking the indentation level and the position of the comment relative to the code.

To fix this bug, the function `_partially_consume_prefix` needs to be modified to correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent. One approach is to maintain a separate variable to track the current level of indentation and adjust the comment indentation accordingly.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        indent_level = 0  # track the current level of indentation
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                    indent_level = 0  # reset the indent level after a new line
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
                if not current_line.strip():  # increase the indent level if it's a new line
                    indent_level += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
                if not current_line.strip():  # increase the indent level if it's a new line
                    indent_level += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                indent_level = 0  # reset the indent level after a new line
                if current_line.strip():  # adjust the comment indentation
                    current_line = '\t' * indent_level + current_line.lstrip()
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent, and the issue should be resolved.
