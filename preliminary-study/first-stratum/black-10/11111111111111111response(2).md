The bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of indentation for comments after a dedent, especially when the input file uses tabs instead of spaces.

The error message from the test function indicates that the actual output is different from the expected output when the function `assertFormatEqual` is called. The specific assertion that fails is comparing the formatting results of `fs(contents_tab)` with `contents_spc`. This suggests that the function responsible for formatting the contents is producing unexpected output for the `contents_tab` input.

Upon analyzing the provided buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix`, it appears that the function is not correctly handling the indentation and newline characters in the provided `prefix` input. This could lead to incorrect indentation for comments in the test cases.

The reason behind the bug is likely the mishandling of indentation and newline characters in the `prefix` input, especially when dealing with tabulated input. The function may not be properly tracking the column position and handling the indentation levels, leading to incorrect formatting of the comments.

To fix the bug, the function `_partially_consume_prefix` needs to be updated to properly handle the indentation and newline characters. This may involve revising the logic for tracking the column position, handling tab characters, and correctly identifying the start of a new line or the end of indentation.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # adjust column for tab
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected implementation should better handle the indentation and newline characters, ensuring that the comments are correctly indented within the specified columns, regardless of the input format (tabs or spaces).
