The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has a few issues that lead to the incorrect behavior observed in the test cases.

Potential error location:
The current implementation of the function does not correctly handle the indentation level of comments after a dedent. This causes the indentation of the comment to be incorrectly adjusted.

Reasons behind the bug:
The function incorrectly handles indentation and new line characters, leading to issues with the correct identification of comment lines and their indentation level.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the logic for tracking the current column and line contents to accurately handle the indentation and new lines.
2. Adjust the conditional checks to correctly identify when a comment should be indented based on the current indentation level.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # reset indentation level when encountering new line
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indentation for comment is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the conditional checks and correctly handling the new line characters, this updated function should address the issues observed in the test cases.
