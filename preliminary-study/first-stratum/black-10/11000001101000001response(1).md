Potential Error Location:
The potential error lies in the conditional check for the indentation level in the for loop. The function is not correctly handling the indentation level and is returning incorrect results.

Reasons for Bug:
The function is not correctly tracking the indentation level and is not handling it properly when encountering different types of indentation characters such as spaces and tabs.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the conditional checks to accurately track the current column and handle different types of indentation characters.
2. Reset the current line and column when encountering a new line character.
3. Ensure that the function correctly handles whitespace characters and counts the correct number of spaces for indentation.

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            current_line = ""
            lines.append(current_line)
            wait_for_nl = False
            continue
        else:
            if wait_for_nl:
                wait_for_nl = False
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True

    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
