1. The test case 'test_comment_indentation' is comparing the expected contents with the actual contents. The error message indicates that the indentation for the comment after a dedent is being changed incorrectly. The specific issue seems to be related to how the function processes the indentation for the comments.

2. The potential error location is within the 'partially_consume_prefix' function, where the handling of indentation and new lines might be causing the incorrect behavior.

3. The bug occurs because the function does not handle the indentation of comments correctly, especially after a dedent. The logic for tracking the current column and waiting for a new line is not correctly handling the indentation levels after a dedent.

4. One possible approach for fixing the bug is to revise the logic for tracking the current column and processing the new lines. Specifically, the function needs to properly handle the indentation level for comments, especially after a dedent.

5. Below is the corrected code for the 'partially_consume_prefix' function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line, reset current_column
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

This corrected code includes an adjustment for the logic that handles the waiting for a new line and tracking the current column, which should resolve the bug related to incorrect handling of the comment indentation after a dedent.
