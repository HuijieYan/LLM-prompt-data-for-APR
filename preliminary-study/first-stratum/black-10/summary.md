I believe there are two potential ways to fix this LLM:

1. The traditional approach is to use tests, but I feel that this may not fully showcase the true capabilities of the LLM. Personally, I think the fix for this might involve stepping through the code one step at a time and observing the changes in key variables. This is because, based on the existing f4-2.md, it should already be solvable through traditional symbolic execution.

2. Based on the information from the pull request (see black-10.md), the original author concluded after analyzing the function call graph that we should assume the tab space size to be 1. The current problem is that, after studying the code, I can't find any clues that indicate a tab space size of 1. My idea is to find a way for the LLM to infer this conclusion on its own through some means.
