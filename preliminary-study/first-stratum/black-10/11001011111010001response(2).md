The error message is showing that the function is not handling comment indentation properly. It seems that the function is not correctly identifying the indentation level of the comment and is adding an extra space in some cases.

The potential error in the function could be in the logic that handles the indentation and wait for new lines. It seems that the function is not properly handling the indentation level when encountering a comment.

The bug occurs because the function is not correctly updating the `current_column` and `current_line` variables when encountering a comment. The logic for handling indentation and new lines is not covering all cases.

To fix the bug, the following approach can be taken:
1. Properly update the `current_column` and `current_line` variables when encountering a comment.
2. Ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation level and new lines for comments.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if wait_for_nl:
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
        else:
            current_column += 1
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
The changes include adding a condition in the `elif char == '\n':` block to account for different cases when encountering a new line.
