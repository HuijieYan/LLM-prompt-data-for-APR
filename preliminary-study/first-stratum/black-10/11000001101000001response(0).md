The potential error in the provided function is that the 'current_line' variable is not being appended to 'lines' when the condition 'if wait_for_nl: char == '\n':' is met. This results in the 'lines' list not being updated with the content of 'current_line'.

The 'wait_for_nl' variable is used to check if the function should wait for a new line character before appending the 'current_line' to 'lines'. However, the logic for updating 'lines' when 'wait_for_nl' is True is not implemented correctly. Additionally, the logic for updating the 'current_column' and resetting 'current_line' after encountering a new line character is missing.

To fix this bug, we need to update the nested condition when 'wait_for_nl' is True to properly append 'current_line' to 'lines' and reset 'current_column' and 'current_line'.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl and char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_column = 0
            current_line = ""
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_column = 0
            current_line = ""
        else:
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
