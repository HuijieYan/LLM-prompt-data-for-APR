The given function `_partially_consume_prefix` is supposed to partially consume the prefix based on the specified column and return the consumed prefix and the remaining prefix. However, it seems to have an issue with handling the indentation level and line breaks, as indicated by the provided test and error message.

The error message from the test function indicates a mismatch in the output. The expected output seems to be different from the actual output, specifically related to the position of the comment.

The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be in the logic related to handling whitespace characters, line breaks, and indentation levels. It appears that the function is not correctly identifying the end of the indentation and is not updating the current position properly.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug could be related to the inconsistent handling of whitespace characters, tabs, and line breaks within the input prefix. The function may not be correctly tracking the current column position and may be failing to detect the end of the indentation for the comment.

To fix the bug, it is important to revise the logic for handling whitespace characters, tabs, and line breaks in the prefix. The function should correctly track the current column position and identify the end of the indentation to consume the prefix accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + '\n')
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_line += char
        else:
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        if current_column >= column:
            break
    remaining_prefix = prefix[len(''.join(lines) + current_line):]
    return ''.join(lines) + current_line, remaining_prefix
```

In the corrected code, each character in the prefix is appropriately handled to update the current column position and line content. Once the column limit is reached, the function breaks and returns the consumed prefix and the remaining prefix accordingly.
