The error occurs in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. This function is intended to partially consume a prefix until a certain column is reached, and return the consumed prefix and the remaining prefix.

The bug occurs because the function does not correctly handle tab characters (`\t`). It erroneously increments the `current_column` by 1 instead of 4 when encountering a tab character.

As a result, when the function encounters a tab character, it incorrectly calculates the `current_column` value, leading to incorrect behavior when determining the column position for comments.

To fix this bug, the function should correctly handle tab characters by incrementing the `current_column` by 4 when encountering a tab.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
            continue
        else:
            if wait_for_nl:
                wait_for_nl = False
            current_column += 1

        current_line += char

        if current_column >= column:
            res = ''.join(lines)
            return res, prefix[len(res):]

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
