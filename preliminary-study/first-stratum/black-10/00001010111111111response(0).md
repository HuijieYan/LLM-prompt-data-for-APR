The error occurs because the `_partially_consume_prefix` function does not handle the indentation properly after a dedent. It should preserve the indentation for comments after a dedent, but it incorrectly changes the indentation.

The potential error location is within the logic for handling the indentation and newline characters in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function.

The bug occurs because the function does not correctly determine the expected column position after a dedent, and it does not properly handle the indentation for comments.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly track the column position after a dedent and handle the indentation for comments based on the column position.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + '\n')
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines) + current_line, ""
```

This corrected code handles the indentation and newline characters properly, ensuring that the comments are preserved with the correct indentation after a dedent.

By using this corrected code, the bug related to incorrect comment indentation after a dedent should be resolved.
