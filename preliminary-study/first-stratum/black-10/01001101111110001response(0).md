The issue seems to be related to the handling of comments in the input code. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is supposed to consume a prefix from the input and return the consumed portion along with the remaining prefix. The bug may be related to how the function handles different characters, including spaces, tabs, and new lines.

Based on the test case and the error message, it seems that the bug causes the function to mishandle the indentation of comments. This is likely due to the function not properly tracking the current column and waiting for a new line before consuming the prefix.

To fix this bug, you can make the following changes to the function:

1. Track the current column position after each character is consumed.
2. Ensure that the function properly detects and handles new lines, spaces, and tabs in relation to comments.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            if char == '#':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This revised function should properly handle the indentation of comments and correctly consume the prefix as intended.
