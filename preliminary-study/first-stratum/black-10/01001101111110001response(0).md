The error occurs because the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not correctly handling the indentation level of the comments. As a result, it is not formatting the code as expected.

The potential error location within the function is in the logic that checks the indentation level and handles the comments.

The bug occurs because the function fails to correctly handle the indentation level of the comments, leading to incorrect formatting of the code.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the logic that handles the indentation level and comments to ensure that the comments are correctly aligned with the code.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            current_line = ""
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
