Potential Error Location:
The issue seems to be with the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, particularly with the logic for handling indentation and comments.

Reason for the Bug:
The function does not correctly handle cases where the comment is not at the same indentation level as the code. It also does not properly strip the whitespace from the lines.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the logic to correctly handle different levels of indentation.
2. Ensure that the function properly strips whitespace from lines and handles the comment indentation correctly.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.lstrip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
