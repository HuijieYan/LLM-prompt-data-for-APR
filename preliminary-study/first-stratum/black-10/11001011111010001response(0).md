The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be related to how it handles the indentation of comments. This is evident from the test function's error message, which shows a difference in the output for indentation of comments. The function is not correctly handling the indentation of comments.

The potential error location within the function is likely the logic that checks for the end of the indentation and starts processing the comment.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the case where the comment starts after the indentation has ended.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic that handles the indentation and comment processing. We should check for the end of the indentation before entering the logic for processing the comment.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
                current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code adjusts the logic to correctly handle the indentation and comment processing, addressing the bug that caused the incorrect output in the test function.
