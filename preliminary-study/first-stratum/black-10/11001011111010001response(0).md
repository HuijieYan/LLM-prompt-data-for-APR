The error is occurring because the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not handling the indentation correctly. It is not recognizing the correct position in the string where the indentation changes and the comment starts.

The potential error location is in the logic for handling the indentation and the comment in the `wait_for_nl` condition.

The bug is occurring because the logic for handling the indentation and the comment is not correctly implemented. The function is not properly updating the `current_column` and `current_line` variables based on the indentation levels and the comment.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly identify the start of the comment and update the `current_column` and `current_line` accordingly. Additionally, the logic for handling indentation with spaces and tabs needs to be improved.

Here is the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
            elif char == '\n':
                wait_for_nl = False
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these changes, the function should be able to correctly handle the indentation and comment scenario provided in the test case. This should resolve the error message and ensure that the function handles different cases of indentation and comments correctly.
