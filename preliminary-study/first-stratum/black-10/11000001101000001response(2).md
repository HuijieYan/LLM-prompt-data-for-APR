The issue with the original function is that the condition to find the end of the indentation is not correctly implemented. This causes the function to not return the expected result for the input cases provided.

The bug occurs because the logic to identify the end of the indentation is incorrect. The current implementation does not handle cases where the indentation is a mix of spaces and tabs, and it does not correctly calculate the end of indentation.

To fix the bug, the logic for identifying the end of the indentation needs to be revised. The function should iterate through the input prefix and keep track of the current indentation level until it finds the end of the indentation. In the provided cases, the prefix is the code snippet before the comment, and the column is the position at which the comment occurs after the indentation. 

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        if current_column >= column:
            res = ''.join(lines)
            return res, prefix[len(res):]
        lines.append(current_line)
        current_line = ""
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By revising the logic in this way, the function should now correctly identify and return the prefix up to the specified column position, which is the end of the indentation.
