Potential error: The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not handling the indentation and waiting for a newline character (\n) correctly. This is causing incorrect behavior when reformatting comments.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The function is not correctly handling the indentation and waiting for a newline character before processing the comment. This leads to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
The function should correctly handle the indentation and wait for a newline character before processing the comment. This will ensure that the comments are properly indented after a dedent.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
