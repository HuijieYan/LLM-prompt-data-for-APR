The bug is likely occurring in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, specifically in the logic for handling tab characters and maintaining the correct indentation level for comments.

The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle the indentation level when encountering tab characters in the prefix string. This leads to incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent, as observed in the test cases.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly calculate the indentation level when encountering tab characters and ensure that the comments maintain the correct level of indentation.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Adjust for tab character
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            elif char != '\r':  # Exclude carriage return
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
