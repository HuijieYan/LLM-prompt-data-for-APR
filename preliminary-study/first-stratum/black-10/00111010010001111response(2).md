The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is incorrectly handling the indentation of comments after a dedent. This function should be responsible for consuming the prefix until a specified column, but it's not correctly handling the indentation in all cases.

The issue arises when the function encounters a comment after a dedent. The function incorrectly resets the current column to 0, which causes the comment to be incorrectly indented.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic of how the function handles the indentation and the wait for a new line.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class Driver(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            if current_column < column:
                if char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                else:
                    current_column += 1
                current_line += char
            else:
                current_line += char
                if char == '\n':
                    wait_for_nl = True
                    
        res = ''.join(lines)
        return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

This corrected function should now correctly handle the indentation and comments after a dedent, ensuring that the comments are indented correctly according to the specified column.
