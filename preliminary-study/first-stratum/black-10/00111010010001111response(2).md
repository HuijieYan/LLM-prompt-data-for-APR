The issue seems to be with the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, which is responsible for consuming a prefix and returning the consumed prefix along with the remaining suffix.

The bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of indentation for comments after a dedent, specifically with tabs. When the input file uses tabs, the indentation for comments past depth 0 is changed incorrectly after a dedent.

The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not handling tab characters correctly and is not properly handling the indentation of comments. This leads to incorrect behavior specifically when the input file uses tabs.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles tab characters and correctly handles the indentation of comments. The `current_column` variable should be adjusted to correctly track the indentation level. When encountering a tab character, the function should increment the `current_column` by 4. Additionally, the logic for waiting for a new line and handling the correct indentation should be adjusted.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these adjustments, the function should now correctly handle the indentation of comments, specifically when using tabs. This should resolve the issue where the indentation for comments is changed incorrectly after a dedent in the presence of tabs.
