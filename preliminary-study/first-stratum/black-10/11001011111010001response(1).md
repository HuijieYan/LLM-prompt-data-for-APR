The bug seems to be in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function where the code is not handling the indentation consistently, leading to incorrect results in the test function `test_comment_indentation`.

The function `test_comment_indentation` compares the expected output with the actual output and raises an `AssertionError` if they are not equal.

The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is in the logic for identifying the indentation level and checking if a comment is at the expected column.

The bug occurs because the function fails to correctly handle the indentation and comment alignment, leading to incorrect results when comparing the expected and actual outputs in the test function.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling the indentation and checking for a comment at the expected column. The function should correctly handle tabs and spaces while counting the current column and checking for the presence of a comment at the expected column.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)  # adjust for tabs
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

In the above code, we have added a correction to handle the tabs and spaces appropriately for counting the current column. We adjusted the column count for tabs to ensure the correct indentation handling. This should fix the bug and the `test_comment_indentation` should pass without errors.
