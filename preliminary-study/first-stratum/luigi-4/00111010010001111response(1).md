The error occurs in the `copy` function where it tries to check the length of `self.columns` without first checking if `self.columns` is not None. The error message "TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()" indicates that `self.columns` is None at the time of the length check.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not None before trying to access its length.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute(
        #... rest of the code ...
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that `self.columns` is not None before trying to access its length, avoiding the TypeError that was occurring.
