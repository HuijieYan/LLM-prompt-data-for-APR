The error is occurring because the `copy` method is trying to check the length of `self.columns` without first checking if `self.columns` is not None.

To fix the bug, you need to modify the `copy` method to handle the case where `self.columns` is None before checking its length. This will prevent the TypeError from occurring when trying to get the length of a NoneType object.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
        COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
        CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
        {options}
        ;""".format(
          table=self.table,
          colnames=colnames,
          source=f,
          creds=self._credentials(),
          options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, the `copy` method will first check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length, preventing the TypeError from occurring.
