The error is occurring because the code is trying to check the length of self.columns, which is None. This causes a TypeError when trying to get the length of a NoneType object.

To fix the bug, we need to check if self.columns is not None before checking its length.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` condition, we ensure that we only try to access the length of the `self.columns` if it is not None.
