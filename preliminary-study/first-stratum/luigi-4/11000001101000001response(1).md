The potential error in the code provided is in the `copy` function. It seems that there are missing placeholders for the SQL formatting in the `cursor.execute` call, and there's a missing parenthesis in the `cursor.execute` line.

The reason behind the bug is that the `cursor.execute` call is not properly formatted. The format placeholders `{}` are missing for the table, colnames, source, creds, and options.

To fix the bug, we need to add the correct placeholders and put the `cursor.execute` call inside a string. Additionally, we need to call the `_credentials` and `copy_options` methods for the object `self`.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    query = """
    COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
    CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
    {options}
    ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options()
    )

    cursor.execute(query)
```
