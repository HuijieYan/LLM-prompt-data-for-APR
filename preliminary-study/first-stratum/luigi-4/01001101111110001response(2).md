The error message from the test function suggests that the `columns` attribute of the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` class is of type `NoneType`, which leads to a `TypeError` when the length of `self.columns` is checked in the `copy` method. This is likely the cause of the bug.

The bug occurs because in the `copy` method, the length of `self.columns` is checked, and if it's greater than 0, then the `colnames` variable is constructed using the column names. However, the `columns` attribute is `None`, so when the length of `None` is checked, it results in a `TypeError`.

To fix the bug, the `copy` method should explicitly handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. This can be done by checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before constructing the `colnames` variable.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `if` statement checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length to prevent the `TypeError` mentioned in the error message. Additionally, the `self.copy_options` method is called with parentheses at the end to correctly include the copy options in the `COPY` statement.
