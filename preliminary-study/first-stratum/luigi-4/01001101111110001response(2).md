The bug in the function `copy` is caused by the `self.copy_options` variable being called as a function when it should be a string. This is evident from the error message `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`, which indicates that `self.copy_options` is `None` and is being used in a way that implies it should be a string.

To fix the bug, the `self.copy_options` variable should be called as a function and its return value should be used as a string in the `cursor.execute` call.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    credentials = self._credentials()
    options = self.copy_options()

    cursor.execute("""
        COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
        CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
        {options}
        ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=credentials,
        options=options)
    )
```

I have added two new lines to store the results of calling `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options()` into the `credentials` and `options` variables respectively. These variables are then used in the `cursor.execute` call.

By making these changes, the bug should be fixed and the function should work as intended.
