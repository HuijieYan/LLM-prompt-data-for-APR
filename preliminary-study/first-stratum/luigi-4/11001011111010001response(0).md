The potential error location within the `copy` function is in the following line: 
```python
colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
```

This line attempts to format the `colnames` variable as a string enclosed in parentheses. However, the issue is that `colnames` might be an empty string or None, which causes the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error.

The reason behind the occurrence of this bug is that the code does not handle the case where `colnames` is an empty string or None. 

To fix the bug, you can modify the `colnames` assignment to handle the case when it is an empty string or None. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected code, we check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to use it to generate the `colnames` string. This change ensures that the `colnames` variable will not be None or an empty string when formatted in the subsequent line.

By making this change, the TypeError should be resolved and the `copy` function should work as expected.
