The bug is likely occurring in the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` class, specifically in the `copy` method. The error message "TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()" suggests that a `NoneType` object is being used with the `len()` function, which is not allowed.

The likely cause of this bug is the `self.columns` attribute being set to `None` in the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` class. This causes an issue when trying to access the length of `self.columns` in the `copy` method.

To fix this bug, you can update the `copy` method to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. You can also initialize `self.columns` to an empty list in the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` class to prevent it from being `None`.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
        COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
        CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
        {options}
        ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that we won't encounter a TypeError when accessing the length of `self.columns`. This will handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.
