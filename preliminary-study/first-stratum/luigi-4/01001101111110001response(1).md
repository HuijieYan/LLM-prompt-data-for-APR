The error message "TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()" in the test function `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` indicates that there is an attempt to call the `len()` function on a variable of type `NoneType` within the code. This typically occurs when a variable that is expected to contain a sequence (e.g., a list, tuple, or string) is `None` instead of the expected sequence. In Python, `NoneType` represents the absence of a value.

The potential error location within the `copy` function is the conditional check and subsequent usage of `self.columns` to construct the `colnames` string. However, in the test scenario, the `columns` attribute is set to `None`, leading to the error when attempting to get the length of `None`.

To fix the bug, a check for the presence of columns should be added before constructing the `colnames` string. If `self.columns` is not `None`, then the `colnames` string should be constructed; otherwise, it should remain an empty string.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check for presence of columns
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected code, a check for the presence of `self.columns` is added before constructing `colnames`. If `self.columns` is not `None`, the `colnames` string is constructed using the column values. Otherwise, `colnames` remains an empty string. Additionally, `self.copy_options` is called as a method by adding parentheses after it to ensure that the correct return value is used in the `COPY` statement.
