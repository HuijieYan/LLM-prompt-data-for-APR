The error occurs on this line in the `copy` method:

```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```

The error message `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` indicates that the `self.columns` is of type None. This happens when the `columns` attribute is set to `None` in the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` class.

To fix this bug, we can check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length. This can be achieved with the following code:

```python
if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
```

Here's the corrected `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, the function should now be able to handle the case where `self.columns` is set to `None` without causing a TypeError.
