The bug occurs when the `columns` attribute of the `task` is set to `None`. This causes an error in the `copy` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class, specifically at the line `if len(self.columns) > 0` where `self.columns` is `None`. This error occurs because `len(None)` is not a valid operation.

To fix this bug, we can modify the condition to first check if `self.columns` is not `None`, and then proceed to check its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, we can assume that there are no columns to be specified.

The corrected code for the `copy` method is as follows:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
        COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
        CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
        {options}
        ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```
In this corrected code, we first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to find its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, we skip the column-related logic and proceed with the `COPY` statement. This fix should resolve the issue where the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` occurred when `columns` are not provided.
