The bug appears to be caused by using the `len()` function on a variable that is of type `None`. Looking at the provided code, the only place where `len()` is used is in the conditional statement `if len(self.columns) > 0`. 

It seems that `self.columns` is expected to be a list, but in the test case `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns`, the `columns` parameter is explicitly set to `None`.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `copy` function to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before trying to use it in the `len()` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
        COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
        CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
        {options}
        ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected code, we check if `self.columns` is not `None` before using `len()` on it. If it is `None`, we skip the colnames processing step. Additionally, `copy_options` is called as a function instead of being used as a variable.
