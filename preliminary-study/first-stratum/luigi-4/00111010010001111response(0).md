Based on the code and the error message, it appears that the issue is occurring due to the comparison of the "self.columns" attribute with the number 0, and since the attribute is set to None, it is causing the TypeError.

To fix this issue, we should modify the if statement to first check if "self.columns" is not None before attempting to get its length.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute(.format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, we are first checking if "self.columns" is not None before attempting to get its length, which should prevent the TypeError from occurring.
