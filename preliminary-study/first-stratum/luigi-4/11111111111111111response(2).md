The error occurs in the `copy` function where the code is trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which is `None` due to the input parameters.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `copy` function to check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length. If it is not None, then we can proceed with checking the length.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
        COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
        CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
        {options}
        ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this modification, we first check if `self.columns` is not None before proceeding to check its length. This should fix the TypeError that was occurring when `self.columns` was None.
