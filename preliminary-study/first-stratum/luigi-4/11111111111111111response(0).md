The issue is occurring in the `copy` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi.contrib.redshift` module. The bug is caused by checking the length of `self.columns` without first checking if it is not None.

To fix the bug, we need to update the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to ensure that `self.columns` is not None before trying to access its length.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
        COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
        CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
        {options}
        ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
    )
```
