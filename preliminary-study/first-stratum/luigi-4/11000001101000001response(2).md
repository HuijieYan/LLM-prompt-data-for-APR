The potential error in the problematic function is in the `cursor.execute` method call. The issue seems to be with using dot `.` instead of `%` or `format` to format the SQL string.

The bug occurs because the `cursor.execute` method call is trying to format the SQL string using dot `.` notation, which is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we should replace the dot `.` with the correct string formatting method such as `%` or `format`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    # Replace dot notation with string formatting using % method
    cursor.execute("""
    COPY %s %s from '%s'
    CREDENTIALS '%s'
    %s
    ;""" % (
        self.table,
        colnames,
        f,
        self._credentials(),
        self.copy_options)
    )
```

By using the correct string formatting method, the bug in the `copy` function should be fixed.
