The bug in the provided code is that `self.copy_options` is being passed as a function without executing it. This is why the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error is occurring in the test function.

To fix this bug, we need to call the `self.copy_options()` function to get the actual options string before passing it to the `cursor.execute` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

By making this change, we are now calling the `self.copy_options()` function and passing its result to the `cursor.execute` method. This should fix the `TypeError` issue.
