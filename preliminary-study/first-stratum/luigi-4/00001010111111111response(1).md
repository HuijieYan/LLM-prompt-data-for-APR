The issue is occurring because the `copy` method is trying to get the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is not None. This is causing a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is None. 

To fix this, we need to modify the condition to first check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, the `copy` method will first check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length, thus avoiding the `TypeError` that was occurring previously.
