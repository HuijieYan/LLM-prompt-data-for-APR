The issue in the `copy` method is that the `self.copy_options` attribute is expected to be a callable (like a method or function), but it is being treated as a string in the `cursor.execute` call. This is why it's resulting in a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `NoneType` in the test case.

To fix this issue:
- `copy_options` should be a method or a function that returns the string of options.
- In the `cursor.execute` call, `self.copy_options` should be replaced with a call to `self.copy_options()` to get the actual string of options.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making `self.copy_options` a method or function and calling it with `self.copy_options()`, it will return the string of options to be used in the `cursor.execute` call. This should fix the `TypeError` issue in the test case.
