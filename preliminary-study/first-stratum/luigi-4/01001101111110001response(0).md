The error "TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()" suggests that the 'columns' attribute of the task is None, and the buggy function is not handling this case properly.

The potential error location is the line `colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)` where it tries to format an empty string if there are no columns.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not handling the case where there are no columns to copy, resulting in an empty string for 'colnames'.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to check if 'colnames' is empty and conditionally include it in the SQL query.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """

    
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    copy_sql = """
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options()
    )
    cursor.execute(copy_sql)
```

In the corrected code, we first check if 'self.columns' is not None before building the 'colnames' string. Then, we conditionally include 'colnames' in the SQL query based on whether any columns exist. This should resolve the issue and handle the case where 'columns' is None.
