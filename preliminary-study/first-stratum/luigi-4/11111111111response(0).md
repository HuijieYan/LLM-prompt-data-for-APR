1. The test case creates an instance of DummyS3CopyToTableKey with columns=None and calls the run method. Inside the run method, the copy method is called with cursor and f as arguments. The error message indicates that a TypeError occurs because len(self.columns) is being called where self.columns is of type None.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the line: if len(self.columns) > 0: inside the copy method.

3. The bug occurs because the code attempts to check the length of self.columns without verifying if it's not None first. Since columns is set to None in the test case, the TypeError occurs when the code tries to retrieve the length of None.

4. To fix the bug, the code needs to first check if self.columns is not None before attempting to get its length.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```
