The error occurs at the line `if len(self.columns) > 0` where it is trying to get the length of `self.columns`. Since `self.columns` is `None`, it is causing the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.

To fix the bug, we can check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute(.format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, the code will first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring.
