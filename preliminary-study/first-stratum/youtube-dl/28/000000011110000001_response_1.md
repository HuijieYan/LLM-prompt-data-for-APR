The error message indicates a ValueError occurring in the _htmlentity_transform function when trying to convert the given entity to a character using the chr() function. The ValueError is raised with the message "chr() arg not in range(0x110000)", indicating that the argument passed to the chr() function is not within the valid Unicode code point range.

The issue is likely due to the fact that the input entity '&#2013266066;' is being interpreted as a numeric HTML entity (due to the '&#'), and its conversion to a character using the chr() function is resulting in a value that is not within the valid Unicode character range.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to handle out-of-range input entities appropriately. One way to do this is to check if the integer value obtained from the entity is within the valid Unicode code point range (0 - 0x10FFFF) before attempting to convert it to a character.

Additionally, the initial check for known non-numeric HTML entities using the compat_html_entities.name2codepoint dictionary should be reviewed to ensure that it covers all necessary cases.

Here's the corrected code for the _htmlentity_transform function:

```python
def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        code_point = int(numstr, base)
        if 0 <= code_point <= 0x10FFFF:
            return compat_chr(code_point)
        else:
            return entity

    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```
In the corrected code, after obtaining the `code_point` from the entity, it is checked whether the `code_point` is within the valid Unicode code point range (0 - 0x10FFFF). If it is within the range, it is converted to a character using the `compat_chr()` function. If the `code_point` is out of range, the original entity is returned as its literal representation.
