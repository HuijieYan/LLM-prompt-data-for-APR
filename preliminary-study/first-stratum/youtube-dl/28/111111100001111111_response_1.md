The error is occurring when the `compat_chr` function is called with an argument that is not within the acceptable range. The `_htmlentity_transform` function translates HTML entities to characters, and it seems that for some entities, the resulting character is outside the valid Unicode code point range, leading to the `ValueError`.

The bug is located in the line `return compat_chr(int(numstr, base))`, where the result of `int(numstr, base)` is not being checked for its validity in the Unicode code point range.

To fix this bug, we can add an additional check to ensure that the result of `int(numstr, base)` is within the valid Unicode code point range before passing it to `compat_chr`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_htmlentity_transform` function:

```python
def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """
    Transforms an HTML entity to a character.
    """

    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        code_point = int(numstr, base)
        if 0 <= code_point <= 0x10FFFF:  # Check for valid Unicode code point
            return compat_chr(code_point)
        else:
            return ''  # Invalid code point, return empty string

    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to ensure that the `code_point` resulting from `int(numstr, base)` is within the valid range (0 to 0x10FFFF). If it's not, we return an empty string to signify that the entity was not translated successfully.
