The error message "ValueError: chr() arg not in range(0x110000)" suggests that the function is trying to convert a value that is not within the valid Unicode range into a character. This could be happening because the function is not handling all possible cases of HTML entities properly, resulting in invalid values being passed to the `chr()` function.

Upon analysis, the potential error location within the function is the handling of HTML entities and their transformation into characters using the `compat_chr()` function.

The bug occurs because the function is not handling all types of HTML entities correctly. For example, for the input entity '#x2F', the function should recognize it as a hexadecimal numeric HTML entity and convert it into the corresponding character. However, the function currently doesn't handle this type of entity properly, leading to the ValueError.

To fix the bug, the function needs to include proper handling for all types of HTML entities, including recognizing hexadecimal numeric entities and converting them into characters.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re
import html.entities as compat_html_entities

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """
    Transforms an HTML entity to a character.
    """

    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        return chr(int(numstr, base))

    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```

With this corrected code, the function should now properly handle all types of HTML entities and transform them into the corresponding characters. This should resolve the ValueError encountered in the test function.
