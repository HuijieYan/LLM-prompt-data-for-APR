The test case is calling the `unescapeHTML` function with an HTML entity '&#2013266066;' as input, and it expects the output to be '&#2013266066;'. However, the function is currently raising a ValueError: unichr() arg not in range(0x110000).

The potential error location is the line:
```python
return compat_chr(int(numstr, base))
```
The `int` function is converting the string representation of the HTML entity to an integer, and then passing it to the `compat_chr` function. The ValueError occurs because the integer representation of the HTML entity is not within the valid range.

The bug is occurring because the code is incorrectly treating the HTML entity '&#2013266066;' as a valid entity and attempting to convert it into a character using `chr` function, which only accepts values in the range 0 to 0x10FFFF.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when the HTML entity is invalid.

Here's the corrected code for the `_htmlentity_transform` function:

```python
def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        value = int(numstr, base)
        if 0 <= value <= 0x10FFFF:
            return compat_chr(value)

    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```
In the corrected code, after obtaining the value of the HTML entity in the `numstr`, we first validate whether the value is in the valid range (0 to 0x10FFFF) before converting it into a character. If the value is not in the valid range, we return the original entity as a string.
