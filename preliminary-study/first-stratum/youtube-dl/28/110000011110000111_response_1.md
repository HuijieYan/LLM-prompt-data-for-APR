Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the line `return compat_chr(int(numstr, base))` within the `_htmlentity_transform` function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The error `ValueError: chr() arg not in range(0x110000)` is occurring because the input number is larger than the maximum Unicode code point.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the input number is within the valid Unicode range before converting it to a character.
2. If the input number is invalid, handle it appropriately, such as returning the input as is.

Corrected code:
```python
import re

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """
    Transforms an HTML entity to a character.
    """

    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        num = int(numstr, base)
        if 0 <= num <= 0x10FFFF:  # Check if the number is within the valid Unicode range
            return compat_chr(num)
        else:
            return entity  # Return the input entity as is if the number is invalid

    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```
