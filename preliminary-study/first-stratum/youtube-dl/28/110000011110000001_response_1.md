Potential Error Location: The issue seems to be in how the function `_htmlentity_transform` handles the HTML entities and converts them to characters.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug seems to occur because the `compat_chr` function (which is probably used to convert the HTML entity to a character) is throwing a `ValueError`. This could be due to an invalid character code being passed to it, resulting in the `chr()` function throwing an error.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the character code obtained from the HTML entity is within the valid range for Unicode characters.
2. Ensure that the `compat_chr` function is handling invalid character codes gracefully.

Corrected Code:
```python
import re

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """
    Transforms an HTML entity to a character.
    """

    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10

        try:
            character_code = int(numstr, base)
            if 0 <= character_code <= 0x10FFFF:  # Check if the character code is within the valid Unicode range
                return compat_chr(character_code)
            else:
                return ''  # Return empty string for invalid character codes
        except ValueError:
            return ''  # Return empty string if character code conversion fails

    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```
