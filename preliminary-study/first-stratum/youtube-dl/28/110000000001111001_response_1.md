Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is the if condition `if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:`. Since `compat_html_entities.name2codepoint` is not defined in the given code, this will result in a NameError.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The `compat_html_entities.name2codepoint` dictionary is not defined in the provided code. This causes a NameError because the code is trying to access a variable or attribute that does not exist.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Define the `compat_html_entities.name2codepoint` dictionary within the code so that it can be accessed.
2. If `compat_html_entities.name2codepoint` is supposed to be a part of an external library or module, make sure that it is imported correctly in the code.

Corrected Code:
```python
import re

compat_html_entities = {
    'name2codepoint': {
        # Define the name to codepoint mapping as required
    }
}

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """
    Transforms an HTML entity to a character.
    """
    
    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in compat_html_entities['name2codepoint']:
        return chr(compat_html_entities['name2codepoint'][entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        return chr(int(numstr, base))

    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```
In the corrected code, the `compat_html_entities.name2codepoint` dictionary is defined within the code, and the incorrect function `compat_chr` is replaced with `chr`. This should fix the NameError and the function should now work as intended.
