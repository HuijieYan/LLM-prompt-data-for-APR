The test case 'test_unescape_html' is checking for the correct conversion of HTML entities to their respective characters. The error message indicates a problem with the transformation of the HTML entity '&#2013266066' to its corresponding character.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line:
```python
return compat_chr(int(numstr, base))
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `int()` function is trying to convert the large number 2013266066 to a character using the `compat_chr()` function, which is causing the ValueError as the argument is out of range for the `chr()` function.

To fix this bug, one approach is to handle the case when the value of the HTML entity is greater than the maximum unicode value, which is 0x110000. This can be checked before calling `compat_chr()`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# corrected function
import re

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        value = int(numstr, base)
        
        # Check if the value is within the range of unicode characters
        if 0 <= value <= 0x110000:
            return compat_chr(value)
        else:
            return entity

    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```

This corrected code handles the case when the value of the HTML entity is out of range for unicode characters and returns the entity itself in that scenario.
