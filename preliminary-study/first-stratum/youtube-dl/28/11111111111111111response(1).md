The error is occurring in the `_htmlentity_transform` function. The `ValueError: chr() arg not in range(0x110000)` is happening because the `int` function in Python 3 does not support values greater than 0x10FFFF. The `int` function is used to convert `numstr` into an integer with the given base.

To fix this bug, we can update the `int` function to handle the `ValueError` in case the value is out of range. We can also add a check to ensure that the value is within the valid Unicode range before converting it to a character.

```
import re
import html.entities

# this is the fixed function
def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """
    Transforms an HTML entity to a character.
    """

    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in html.entities.name2codepoint:
        return chr(html.entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        try:
            num = int(numstr, base=0)
        except ValueError:
            return ('&%s;' % entity)

        if 0 < num <= 0x10FFFF:
            return chr(num)
        else:
            return ('&%s;' % entity)

    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```
