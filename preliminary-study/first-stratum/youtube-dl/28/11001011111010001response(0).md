The error message "ValueError: chr() arg not in range(0x110000)" indicates that there is an issue with the conversion of a number to a Unicode character in the `unescapeHTML` function.

The problem in the `unescapeHTML` function seems to be related to the handling of numeric HTML entities, particularly the conversion of these entities to characters.

The issue is likely due to the fact that some HTML entities are being converted to characters using the `chr()` function, which only supports characters in the Unicode range up to 0x10FFFF. The value 2013266066 in the entity "&#2013266066;" exceeds this range, causing the ValueError.

To fix this issue, we need to update the logic for converting numeric HTML entities to characters, ensuring that the values are within the valid Unicode range.

Here's the corrected code for the `_htmlentity_transform` function:

```python
def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            num = int(numstr[1:], 16)
        else:
            num = int(numstr, 10)

        if 0 < num <= 0x10FFFF:  # Check if the value is within the valid Unicode range
            return compat_chr(num)
        else:
            return ('&%s;' % entity)

    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```

In this corrected code, we check if the numeric value obtained from the HTML entity is within the valid Unicode range before converting it to a character. If the value is within the valid range, we use `compat_chr(num)` to convert it to a character. Otherwise, we return the original entity. This ensures that the `unescapeHTML` function will not encounter ValueError due to out-of-range Unicode characters.
