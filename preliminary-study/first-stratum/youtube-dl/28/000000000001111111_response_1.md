The bug occurs in the `_htmlentity_transform` function when trying to convert a numeric HTML entity to a character using the `compat_chr` function. The error message "ValueError: unichr() arg not in range(0x110000) (wide Python build)" indicates that the argument passed to `unichr` is outside the valid range.

The bug occurs because the `compat_chr` function is attempting to convert the HTML entity to a character using the wide Python build, which has a larger valid range for Unicode characters (up to 0x110000). However, some HTML entities may be outside this range, leading to the ValueError.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_htmlentity_transform` function to handle cases where the HTML entity is outside the valid range of Unicode characters. We can check if the value obtained from the HTML entity is within the valid range before attempting to convert it to a character.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):

    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        codepoint = int(numstr, base)

        # Check if the codepoint is within the valid Unicode range
        if 0 <= codepoint <= 0x10FFFF:
            return compat_chr(codepoint)

    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```

In the corrected code, after obtaining the codepoint from the numeric HTML entity, we explicitly check if the codepoint is within the valid range of Unicode characters (0x0000 to 0x10FFFF). If it is within the range, we use `compat_chr` to convert it to a character. If it's outside the valid range, we can handle it accordingly (e.g., returning a placeholder character or raising an exception).

This modification ensures that the function can handle a wider range of HTML entities without raising a ValueError.
