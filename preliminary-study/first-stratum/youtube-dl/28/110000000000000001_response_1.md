Potential Error:
The bug may occur in the line `if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint`, as `compat_html_entities.name2codepoint` is used without being defined in the function. This would cause the function to throw an error when it tries to use `compat_html_entities.name2codepoint`.

Reason for the Bug:
The `compat_html_entities.name2codepoint` is not defined within the function, so the function is unable to access it. This results in an error when the function tries to use it.

Approach to Fix the Bug:
We need to define `compat_html_entities.name2codepoint` within the function or pass it as an argument to the function.

Corrected Code:
```python
# corrected function
import re

# defining compat_html_entities.name2codepoint dictionary
compat_html_entities = {
    "name2codepoint": {
        # define the mapping of HTML entity names to code points
    }
}

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """
    Transforms an HTML entity to a character.
    """

    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in compat_html_entities['name2codepoint']:
        return chr(compat_html_entities['name2codepoint'][entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        return chr(int(numstr, base))

    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```
