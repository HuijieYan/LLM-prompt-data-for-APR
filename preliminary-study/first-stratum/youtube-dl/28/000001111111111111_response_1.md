The error is occurring in the function `_htmlentity_transform` which is used by the `unescapeHTML` function. The error is raised when trying to convert the integer value to a character using the `chr` function.

The error occurs because the integer value being passed to the `chr` function is not in the valid Unicode range (0x110000). This indicates that the input value being converted to an integer is incorrect in some cases.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the input value being converted to an integer is within the valid Unicode range. This can be achieved by checking the range of the input value and handling it appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the `_htmlentity_transform` function:

```python
import re

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = numstr[1:]  # Remove the leading 'x'
        else:
            base = 10
        value = int(numstr, base)
        
        # Check if the value is within the valid Unicode range
        if value < 0x110000:
            return compat_chr(value)
        else:
            # Handle out-of-range values here
            return ''
    
    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```

This corrected code includes a check to ensure that the value being converted to a character is within the valid Unicode range. If the value is out of range, it returns an empty string.
