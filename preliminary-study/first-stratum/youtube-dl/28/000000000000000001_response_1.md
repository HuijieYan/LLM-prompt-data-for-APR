Potential error location: The issue may be with the import statement `from html.entities import html5`, `from html.entities import codepoint2name` and `compat_chr` method which is not defined in the provided code and could potentially cause an error.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The code is referencing variables and methods from `compat_html_entities` and `compat_chr` without defining or importing them.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Define `compat_html_entities` with the appropriate content or import it from a module if available.
2. Define `compat_chr` and `re` if they are not defined or imported already.

This is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected function
import html.entities
import re

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    if entity in html.entities.name2codepoint:
        return chr(html.entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        return chr(int(numstr, base))

    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```
