The error occurs because the `int` function is called with a value that is not within the valid Unicode range. This happens due to how the `numstr` variable is processed. To fix this bug, the logic to convert HTML entities to characters needs to be corrected.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """
    Transforms an HTML entity to a character.
    """

    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        num = int(numstr, 0)  # Convert to integer using base 0
        return chr(num)

    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```

This code corrects the issue by utilizing the `chr` function directly to convert the integer value derived from the HTML entity. The base parameter for the `int` function is set to 0, allowing for automatic base detection based on the prefix of the number.
