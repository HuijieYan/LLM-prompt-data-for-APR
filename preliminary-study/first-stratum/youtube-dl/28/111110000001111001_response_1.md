The bug in the provided code appears to be related to the import statements missing from the code snippet and the use of undefined functions such as `compat_chr` and `compat_html_entities.name2codepoint`. 

It seems that the function is trying to transform HTML entities to characters, but it relies on external references to accomplish this transformation. Since `compat_chr` and `compat_html_entities` are not defined within the provided code, the `htmlentity_transform` method cannot function as intended.

To fix this bug, one potential approach would be to properly define the missing functions and import the required modules so that the `htmlentity_transform` function can work as intended.

Here's the corrected function with the assumption that the missing modules and functions have been properly defined:

```python
import re
import compat_html_entities

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """
    Transforms an HTML entity to a character.
    """

    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        return chr(int(numstr, base))

    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```

Please note that the corrected function assumes that the `compat_html_entities` module and the `compat_chr` function are properly defined and imported into the code. If these functions or imports are not defined, you will need to define them appropriately.
