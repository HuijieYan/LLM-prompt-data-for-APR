The error message "ValueError: unichr() arg not in range(0x110000)" indicates that the function _htmlentity_transform is trying to convert a number to a Unicode character using unichr(), but the number is not in the valid Unicode range.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line "return compat_chr(int(numstr, base))", specifically the conversion of the integer from numstr to a Unicode character.

The bug occurred because the function was attempting to convert HTML entities to Unicode characters, but it did not handle non-numeric entities properly. As a result, when encountering a non-numeric entity, such as "&#2013266066;", the function attempted to convert it to a Unicode character, leading to the ValueError.

To fix this bug, the function needs to handle non-numeric entities properly and ensure that the conversion to a Unicode character is within the valid Unicode range.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import re
import html

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    if entity.startswith('&#'):
        try:
            if entity.startswith('&#x'):
                # Convert hexadecimal numeric entity to Unicode character
                numstr = entity[3:-1]
                return html.unescape('&#x' + numstr + ';')
            else:
                # Convert decimal numeric entity to Unicode character
                numstr = entity[2:-1]
                return html.unescape('&#' + numstr + ';')
        except ValueError:
            # Return the entity as is if the conversion fails
            return ('&%s;' % entity)
    else:
        # Return the entity as is if it's not numeric
        return ('&%s;' % entity)
```

In the corrected code, we use the html.unescape() function to handle the conversion of both decimal and hexadecimal numeric entities to Unicode characters. We also added a try-except block to handle the case where the conversion fails and return the entity as is in that case. Additionally, if the entity is not numeric, we also return it as is.
