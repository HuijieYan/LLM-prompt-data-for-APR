The bug in the provided function is that it is attempting to use the `compat_chr` function to convert HTML entities into characters, but it is not checking whether the character falls within the valid Unicode range before doing the conversion. This is causing a `ValueError` when the character is outside the valid range.

The error message "ValueError: unichr() arg not in range(0x110000) (wide Python build)" indicates that the argument passed to the `unichr` function is not within the valid Unicode range.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `compat_chr` function checks whether the character is within the valid Unicode range before converting it.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import re

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """
    Transforms an HTML entity to a character.
    """
    max_unicode = 0x110000  # Maximum Unicode value

    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        codepoint = compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity]
        if codepoint < max_unicode:
            return compat_chr(codepoint)
        else:
            return ''

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        codepoint = int(numstr, base)
        if codepoint < max_unicode:
            return compat_chr(codepoint)
        else:
            return ''

    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```

In this corrected code, we added a check to ensure that the codepoint is within the valid Unicode range before using `compat_chr` to convert it into a character. If the codepoint is outside the valid range, an empty string is returned instead. This prevents the `ValueError` when the codepoint is outside the valid range.
