The function `_htmlentity_transform` is intended to transform HTML entities to characters. The error occurs when trying to transform the entity `'#2013266066'` to a character.

The bug is likely caused by the fact that the `int` function call with a large value (`2013266066`) returns a value outside the valid range for the `chr` function. The `chr` function can only handle values in the range 0 to 1,114,111 (0x10FFFF in base-16). Therefore, the large value `2013266066` is causing the `ValueError` during the call to `chr`.

To fix this issue, it would be necessary to handle large values differently, or possibly use a different approach to handle entities with such large numeric codes.

Here's the corrected code for the `_htmlentity_transform` function:

```python
import re
import html
from html.entities import entitydefs

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """
    Transforms an HTML entity to a character.
    """

    if entity in entitydefs:
        return entitydefs[entity]
    
    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        try:
            if numstr.startswith('x'):
                return chr(int(numstr[1:], 16))  # Handle hexadecimal numbers
            else:
                return chr(int(numstr, 10))  # Handle decimal numbers
        except ValueError:
            return entity  # Return original entity if conversion fails

    return entity  # Return original entity if it's not recognized
```

This corrected code utilizes the `entitydefs` to handle known HTML entities and `chr` function to handle numeric codes. It also includes exception handling to return the original entity if the conversion fails.
