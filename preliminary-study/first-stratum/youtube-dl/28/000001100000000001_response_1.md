Potential error:
The potential error in the given function is that the 're' module is not imported, but it is being used in the function. Additionally, the 'compat_chr' and 'compat_html_entities' modules are not defined in the given function.

Reason for the bug:
The 're' module is required for using regular expressions, and the 'compat_chr' and 'compat_html_entities' modules are necessary for the function to work properly. Since these modules are not imported or defined within the function, it will result in errors when the function is called.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Import the 're' module at the beginning of the file to use regular expressions in the function.
2. Define the 'compat_chr' and 'compat_html_entities' modules or import them from another file if they exist elsewhere in the codebase.

Corrected code:

```python
import re
from some_module import compat_chr, compat_html_entities  # Import or define these modules as needed

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    
    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        return compat_chr(int(numstr, base))

    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```
