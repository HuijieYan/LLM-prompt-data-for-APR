Based on the test case and the error message, the issue seems to be occurring within the `_htmlentity_transform` function when handling the input `'#2013266066'`.

The error message indicates that the `ValueError: chr() arg not in range(0x110000)` is raised, suggesting that the `int` conversion in the function is resulting in values outside the valid range for the `chr()` function.

The bug occurs due to the conversion of the input value to an integer using `int(numstr, base)`, where `numstr` is retrieved from the matched object. This causes a problem when the number is too large to be represented by a Unicode character.

To fix this bug, a simple approach would be to validate the `int` conversion before converting it to a character. If the value exceeds the valid Unicode range, it should be handled differently, such as returning a placeholder or an error message.

Here's the corrected code for the `_htmlentity_transform` function:

```python
import sys  # add import statement

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """
    Transforms an HTML entity to a character.
    """

    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        try:
            result = compat_chr(int(numstr, base))
            if ord(result) > sys.maxunicode:
                result = 'Placeholder'  # handle large values
            return result
        except ValueError:
            return 'Invalid input'  # handle conversion failures
    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```

In the corrected code, additional checks have been added to handle large Unicode values and conversion failures, providing more robust handling of input values.
