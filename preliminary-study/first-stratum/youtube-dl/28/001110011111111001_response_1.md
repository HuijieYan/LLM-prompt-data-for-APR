The potential error location within the problematic function is the `compat_chr` function, particularly where it takes the argument `int(numstr, base)`. The error occurs because when converting large integers to characters directly, the `compat_chr` function does not handle the integer that is out of range.

The bug occurs because the `compat_chr` function does not handle integers that are outside the valid Unicode range (0 to 0x10FFFF). It tries to convert a very large integer into a character, causing a ValueError.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the integer is within the valid Unicode range before converting it into a character.

Below is the corrected code for the `_htmlentity_transform` function:

```python
def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    import html
    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        num = int(numstr, base)
        if 0 <= num <= 0x10FFFF:
            return compat_chr(num)

    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the integer is within the valid Unicode range (0 to 0x10FFFF) before converting it into a character. If it is outside this range, we return the original entity as its literal representation.
