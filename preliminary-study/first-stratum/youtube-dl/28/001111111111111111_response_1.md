The issue occurs when the function `_htmlentity_transform` tries to convert the HTML entity `#2013266066` into its corresponding character representation. The function currently uses the `compat_chr` method, which in Python 2.x corresponds to `unichr`, to perform this conversion.

The problem here is that the value `2013266066` is greater than the maximum allowed Unicode code point of 1114111 (0x10FFFF in hexadecimal), which causes a ValueError when trying to create a Unicode character from this code point.

To fix this issue, we can modify the function to handle cases where the entity value exceeds the maximum allowed Unicode code point. One approach is to return the entity as is, without conversion, in such cases.

Here's the corrected code for the `_htmlentity_transform` function:

```python
def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    
    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        code_point = int(numstr, base)
        
        # Check if the code point is within the valid Unicode range
        if 0 <= code_point <= 0x10FFFF:
            return compat_chr(code_point)
        else:
            # The code point is out of range, return the entity as is
            return ('&%s;' % entity)

    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```

This modification ensures that the function handles cases where the entity value is beyond the valid Unicode code point range, preventing the ValueError from occurring.

With this correction, the test case that was failing due to the ValueError should now pass without any issues.
