The error is occurring when the unescapeHTML function is called with the input '&#2013266066;'. This input is being passed into the _htmlentity_transform function, where it is attempting to convert the numeric HTML entity to a character using the function compat_chr. However, the error is occurring when trying to convert the large integer 2013266066 to a character, and this is causing the ValueError.

The bug is due to the fact that the code is attempting to convert numerical HTML entities to characters without considering their range. The range of valid Unicode code points is from U+0000 to U+10FFFF. The value 2013266066 is outside of this valid range, hence the ValueError.

To fix this bug, the code should check if the integer value derived from the HTML entity falls within the valid Unicode code points range before attempting to convert it to a character. If the value is outside this range, it should return the original entity as its literal representation.

Here's the corrected code for the _htmlentity_transform function:

```python
def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        # Check if the numerical HTML entity falls within the valid Unicode code points range
        num = int(numstr, 16 if numstr.startswith('x') else 10)
        if 0 <= num <= 0x10FFFF:
            return compat_chr(num)
        else:
            # Return the original entity as its literal representation
            return ('&%s;' % entity)

    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```
