The bug in the provided function is due to the use of undefined functions and variables. The function `compat_chr` and the dictionary `compat_html_entities.name2codepoint` are not defined within the function, resulting in errors.

To fix this bug, we need to define the `compat_chr` function and the `compat_html_entities` dictionary, or replace them with appropriate built-in Python functions.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import html

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    return html.unescape(entity)
```

In the corrected code, we're using the `html` module's `unescape` function to transform HTML entities to characters. This eliminates the need for the `compat_chr` function and the `compat_html_entities` dictionary and ensures that the HTML entities are properly transformed.
