The error occurs because the `chr()` function takes an integer value to create a character, and the value must be in the range from 0 to 0x10FFFF (inclusive). However, the input value `2013266066` is beyond this range, which results in a `ValueError` being raised.

To fix this, we need to modify the `_htmlentity_transform` function to handle this out-of-range input. One option is to return the entity as it is if the input value is out of range, treating it as an unknown entity. Another option is to replace it with a placeholder character such as '?'.

Below is the corrected code:

```python
import re
import html

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """
    Transforms an HTML entity to a character.
    """

    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in html.entities.html5:
        return html.entities.html5[entity]

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        try:
            return chr(int(numstr, mobj.start(1).startswith('x') and 16 or 10))
        except ValueError:
            return '?'  # Placeholder character for out-of-range input

    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```

With this modification, the function now handles the out-of-range input and returns a placeholder character instead of raising a `ValueError`.
