The error message "ValueError: unichr() arg not in range(0x110000) (wide Python build)" indicates that the input in the _htmlentity_transform function is exceeding the valid unicode range.

The issue occurs in the _htmlentity_transform function where it tries to convert the HTML entity into a character. The bug occurs when the function encounters an entity with a large number, such as "&#2013266066;", which is outside the valid unicode range.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to handle the situation where the entity value is not within the valid unicode range. One approach is to check if the value falls within the allowable unicode range before performing the transformation. If it's outside the range, the function can handle it differently, for example by returning a placeholder character or an error message.

Here's the corrected code for the _htmlentity_transform function:

```python
def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """
    Transforms an HTML entity to a character.
    """
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        num = int(numstr, base=16 if numstr.startswith('x') else 10)
        if 0x0 <= num <= 0x10FFFF:
            return compat_chr(num)
        else:
            return 'Invalid Unicode'

    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to ensure that the unicode value falls within the valid range before performing the transformation. This ensures that the function handles large or invalid unicode values gracefully without causing an error.
