The bug occurs in the `unescapeHTML` function, which tries to unescape HTML entities. The error occurs when the function encounters the HTML entity '&#2013266066;' and tries to convert it into a character using the `_htmlentity_transform` function.

The bug appears to be in the `_htmlentity_transform` function. This function first checks if the entity is a known non-numeric HTML entity and returns the corresponding character if it is. If not, it tries to match the entity against a regular expression pattern and convert it into a character based on the matched number string.

The error occurred because the code attempted to convert the HTML entity '&#2013266066;' into a character using the `unichr` function. The value 2013266066 is not a valid Unicode code point, which caused the ValueError.

To fix this bug, the `_htmlentity_transform` function should be modified to handle large numeric HTML entities that exceed the valid Unicode code point range. This can be done by converting these entities into surrogate pairs, which are used to represent Unicode code points outside the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) in UTF-16 encoding.

Here's the corrected code for the `_htmlentity_transform` function:

```python
def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """
    Transforms an HTML entity to a character.
    """

    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        code_point = int(numstr, base)
        if code_point > 0x10FFFF:  # Maximum valid Unicode code point
            return '\uFFFD'  # Replace invalid characters with the 'replacement character'
        elif code_point > 0xFFFF:  # Outside BMP
            code_point -= 0x10000
            surrogate_pair = (0xD800 + (code_point >> 10), 0xDC00 + (code_point & 0x3FF))
            return ''.join([chr(surrogate) for surrogate in surrogate_pair])
        else:
            return compat_chr(code_point)

    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```

With this modification, the function should handle large numeric HTML entities correctly and prevent the ValueError from occurring.
