The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statement that checks if the entity is a known non-numeric HTML entity. In the given test cases, the entity value is numeric and starts with either 'x' or a digit.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug are:
1. The conditional statement only handles known non-numeric HTML entities, but the test cases include numeric entities.
2. The function does not handle the numeric entities properly, leading to incorrect outputs.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to handle both known non-numeric HTML entities and numeric entities. The function should also handle entities in the form of decimal or hexadecimal representations properly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re
import html.entities as htmlentities

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    if entity in htmlentities.name2codepoint:
        return chr(htmlentities.name2codepoint[entity])
    
    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        return chr(int(numstr, base))

    # Unknown entity, return its literal representation
    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```

In the corrected function, we import the `html.entities` module and use its `name2codepoint` to handle known non-numeric HTML entities. We also update the regex pattern to handle both decimal and hexadecimal representations of numeric entities. Finally, we use the `chr` function to convert the code point to a character for both known and unknown entities.
