The error message indicates that there is a ValueError occurring at line 411 in utils.py. This error is due to the fact that the `chr()` function is being given a value that is not in the valid Unicode range.

The issue in the code is that the `chr()` function is being applied to the result of converting a large number from a string using the `int()` function. The `int()` function is converting the string to an integer that is too large for the valid Unicode range. This is happening because the regular expression pattern used in the `_htmlentity_transform` function, which is meant to transform HTML entities to characters, is not handling large numerical HTML entities correctly. 

To fix this issue, we need to update the function to properly handle large numerical HTML entities. One approach to solve this issue is to first check if the number extracted from the HTML entity is valid and within the Unicode range before converting it to a character using `chr()`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_htmlentity_transform` function:

```python
import re

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        num = int(numstr, base)
        if 0 <= num <= 0x10FFFF:
            return compat_chr(num)

    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```

In the corrected code, we've added a check to ensure that the `num` is within the valid Unicode range before converting it to a character using `chr()`.

By implementing this fix, the code should now properly handle large numerical HTML entities and prevent the ValueError from occurring.
