The error message suggests that there is a ValueError occurring in the unescapeHTML function while processing the entity '&#2013266066'. This error is related to the chr() function being called with an argument that is not within the valid range. The chr() function expects an integer representing a Unicode code point, and the ValueError indicates that the code point being passed is not valid.

The issue is likely occurring within the _htmlentity_transform function, specifically when trying to convert the entity '&#2013266066' to a character using the chr() function.

The bug occurs because the method is trying to convert a numeric HTML entity to a character using the chr() method, but the numeric HTML entity '&#2013266066' does not correspond to a valid Unicode code point.

To fix this bug, we can update the _htmlentity_transform function to handle numeric HTML entities that do not correspond to valid Unicode code points by returning their literal representation.

Here's the corrected _htmlentity_transform function:
```python
def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """
    Transforms an HTML entity to a character.
    """
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        code_point = int(numstr, base)
        try:
            return compat_chr(code_point)
        except ValueError:
            return f'&{entity};'

    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```
In the corrected code, after obtaining the integer code point from the numeric HTML entity, we use a try-except block to handle the ValueError that may occur when trying to convert the code point to a character. If a ValueError occurs, we return the literal representation of the entity.
