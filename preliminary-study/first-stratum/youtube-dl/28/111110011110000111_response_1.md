1. The test case is calling the unescapeHTML function with the input '&#2013266066;', which is causing the ValueError with the message "ValueError: chr() arg not in range(0x110000)".

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line "return compat_chr(int(numstr, base))" as this is where the ValueError is being raised.

3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the input '&#2013266066;' is being converted to a character using the chr() function, but the argument passed to the chr() function is not in the range of valid Unicode code points.

4. To fix the bug, we can first check if the input number is within the valid range of Unicode code points before converting it to a character. If it is not within the valid range, we can handle it differently, such as returning the original input as a string.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """
    Transforms an HTML entity to a character.
    """

    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10

        codepoint = int(numstr, base)
        if 0 <= codepoint <= 0x10FFFF:  # Check if the codepoint is within the valid Unicode range
            return compat_chr(codepoint)
        else:
            return entity  # Return the original input if the codepoint is not valid

    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```
