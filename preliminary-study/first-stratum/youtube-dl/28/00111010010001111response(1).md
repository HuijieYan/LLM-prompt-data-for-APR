The error is occurring in the `compat_chr(int(numstr, base))` line. The `int` function is converting `numstr` to an integer, and then passing it to the `compat_chr` function, which is causing the `ValueError: unichr() arg not in range(0x110000) (wide Python build)`.

The reason behind the bug is that the `int` function is converting the string `numstr` to an integer, which is then used as an argument to `compat_chr`, and the value is not in the valid range for the `compat_chr` function.

To fix this bug, the code needs to check if the value obtained from `int(numstr, base)` is within the valid range for `compat_chr`. If it's not, then handle it appropriately.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    
    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        value = int(numstr, base)
        if 0 <= value <= 0x10FFFF:
            return compat_chr(value)
        else:
            return ''
    
    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```

In this corrected code, after obtaining the value from `int(numstr, base)`, we check if it's within the valid Unicode range (0x0 to 0x10FFFF). If it's not within this range, we return an empty string to indicate that the conversion was invalid.
