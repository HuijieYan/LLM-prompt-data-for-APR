The error occurs in the function `_htmlentity_transform` in the `utils.py` file. The error is a `ValueError: chr() arg not in range(0x110000)` and it occurs when the function tries to convert a large integer to a character using the `chr` function.

The issue is caused by attempting to convert large integers (like `2013266066`) to characters using the `chr` function, which only works for values within the range 0 to 1114111 (0x10FFFF in base-16). 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `if` condition that checks for known non-numeric HTML entities to handle large integers as well.

Here's the corrected code for the `_htmlentity_transform` function:

```python
import re
import html.entities as html_entities

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """
    Transforms an HTML entity to a character.
    """
    
    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity[0] == '#':
        num_str = entity[1:]
        if num_str[0] == 'x':
            base = 16
            num_str = num_str[1:]
        else:
            base = 10
        try:
            # Try converting to integer and then to a character
            return chr(int(num_str, base))
        except ValueError:
            pass

    if entity in html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return chr(html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])
    
    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```

This corrected function includes a try-except block to handle the conversion of large integers to characters and falls back to the previous approach if the conversion fails. Additionally, it incorporates the `html.entities` module to ensure that known HTML entities are handled correctly.
