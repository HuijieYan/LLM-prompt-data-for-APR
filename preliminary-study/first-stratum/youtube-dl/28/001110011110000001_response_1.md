The test case 'self.assertEqual(unescapeHTML('&#2013266066;'), '&#2013266066;')' is failing with a ValueError. This occurs because the original function '_htmlentity_transform' is using the 'compat_chr' function to return the character representation of the HTML entity. However, the 'compat_chr' function is throwing a ValueError due to the argument not being in the valid range.

The bug occurs because the 'compat_chr' is not handling the case where the entity exceeds the valid range of characters. 

To fix this bug, we can use Python's built-in 'chr' function, which can handle a larger range of Unicode characters compared to 'compat_chr'. We also need to handle the case where the entity is not a numeric HTML entity.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import re

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
    
    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        try:
            return chr(int(numstr, base))
        except ValueError:
            return ('&%s;' % entity)
    
    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```

With these changes, the function should be able to handle a wider range of HTML entities and return the correct character representation.
