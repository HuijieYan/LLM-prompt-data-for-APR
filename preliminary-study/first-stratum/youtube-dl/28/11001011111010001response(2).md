The error message "ValueError: chr() arg not in range(0x110000)" indicates that the function is trying to convert a value that is outside the valid Unicode range into a character, which is causing the error.

The issue is likely occurring in the `compat_chr` function, which is used to convert code points to their corresponding Unicode characters.

The bug occurs because the function does not check if the numerical value obtained from the HTML entity encoding is within the valid Unicode range before converting it to a character. 

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the numerical value obtained from the HTML entity encoding is within the valid Unicode range before converting it to a character.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])
        
    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        code_point = int(numstr, base)
        if 0 <= code_point <= 0x10FFFF:
            return compat_chr(code_point)

    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```

In the corrected code, after obtaining the numerical value from the HTML entity encoding, we check if it is within the valid Unicode range (from 0 to 0x10FFFF) before converting it to a character. If the code point is within the valid range, we proceed with the conversion; otherwise, we return the original entity with the '&' and ';' symbols. This prevents the ValueError from occurring.
