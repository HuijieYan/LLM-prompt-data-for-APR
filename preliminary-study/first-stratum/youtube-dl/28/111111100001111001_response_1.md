The buggy function '_htmlentity_transform' is intended to transform an HTML entity to a character. The function checks for known non-numeric HTML entities, then matches and transforms numeric HTML entities into characters. If an entity is unknown, it returns its literal representation.

After analyzing the function and test cases, it appears that the bug lies in the logic for handling numeric HTML entities. Specifically, when the entity is a numeric value, the code attempts to convert it to a character. However, the logic for transforming numeric HTML entities into characters is flawed.

To fix the bug, the code should be updated to properly handle the transformation of numeric HTML entities into characters. One approach is to directly convert numeric HTML entities into their corresponding characters using the Python 'chr' function.

Here's the corrected code for the '_htmlentity_transform' function:

```python
import re

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """
    Transforms an HTML entity to a character.
    """

    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    if entity.startswith('#x'):
        # Convert hexadecimal numeric entity to character
        return chr(int(entity[2:], 16))
    elif entity.startswith('#'):
        # Convert decimal numeric entity to character
        return chr(int(entity[1:]))
    else:
        # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
        return ('&%s;' % entity)
```

The fixed code introduces logic to differentiate between hexadecimal and decimal numeric entities. It then uses the Python 'chr' function to directly convert the numeric entities into characters. This fix addresses the issues identified in the original buggy function.
