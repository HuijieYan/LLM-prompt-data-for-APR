Potential error location: The main potential error in the function is the usage of `compat_html_entities.name2codepoint` and `compat_chr` without their definitions in the code.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The code is likely missing the definitions of `compat_html_entities.name2codepoint` and `compat_chr`, which are being used in the function.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Define `compat_html_entities.name2codepoint` and `compat_chr` within the code or import them from an external source if they are part of a library.
2. Handle the case where `compat_html_entities.name2codepoint` and `compat_chr` are not available by providing alternative implementations for them.

Corrected code:

```python
import re

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    # Placeholder for compat_html_entities.name2codepoint
    compat_html_entities = {
        "name2codepoint": {
            # Define known HTML entities here
        }
    }

    # Placeholder for compat_chr
    def compat_chr(codepoint):
        return chr(codepoint)

    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in compat_html_entities["name2codepoint"]:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities["name2codepoint"][entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        return compat_chr(int(numstr, base))

    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return ('&%s;' % entity)
``` 

In the corrected code, I have provided placeholder definitions for `compat_html_entities.name2codepoint` and `compat_chr`, which can be replaced with the actual definitions or implementations as required. This will ensure that the function can run without errors related to missing definitions.
