The error is likely in the line `param = params.get(param)` as this line is assuming that param is the key to be extracted from the params dictionary. However, this is incorrect as param is actually the value associated with the key 'nocheckcertificate'. 

The buggy function is failing because it is not handling the `separator` parameter correctly. The function is only adding the separator when it's present, but it should always add it when the separator is present. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle the `separator` parameter properly and also use the correct key to extract the value from the `params` dictionary.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def cli_bool_option(params, command_option, param, true_value='true', false_value='false', separator=None):
    value = params.get(param)
    assert isinstance(value, bool)
    if separator:
        return [command_option + separator + (true_value if value else false_value)]
    return [command_option, true_value if value else false_value]
```

With the corrected function, the test cases should now pass without any errors.
