The bug is occurring in the cli_bool_option function, specifically in the assertion that checks if the param is a boolean. The error message indicates that the param is None in one of the test cases, which leads to the AssertionError.

The potential error location is the line with the assertion `assert isinstance(param, bool)`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. The function does not handle the case where the param is not present in the params dictionary, which leads to getting a None value for param.
2. The function does not check if the param value is present in the params dictionary.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add a check to ensure that the param is present in the params dictionary and handle the case where it is not present.
2. Check if the param retrieved from params is a boolean before performing the assertion.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def cli_bool_option(params, command_option, param, true_value='true', false_value='false', separator=None):
    param = params.get(param)
    if param is not None:
        assert isinstance(param, bool)
        if separator:
            return [command_option + separator + (true_value if param else false_value)]
        return [command_option, true_value if param else false_value]
    return []
```
