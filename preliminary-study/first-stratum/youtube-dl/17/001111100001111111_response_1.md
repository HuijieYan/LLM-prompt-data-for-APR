The bug is located within the `cli_bool_option` function. The function is supposed to take a parameter from a dictionary, assert that it is a boolean, and then return a list based on the value of the parameter.

The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle the case where the `param` is a boolean. It assumes that the `param` is always a string and tries to convert it to a boolean using the `true_value` and `false_value` parameters.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the conversion of the `param` to a boolean, as it is already asserted to be a boolean. We also need to handle the case where the `separator` is provided and adjust the return value accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `cli_bool_option` function:

```python
def cli_bool_option(params, command_option, param, true_value='true', false_value='false', separator=None):
    assert isinstance(params[param], bool)

    if separator:
        if params[param]:
            return [command_option + separator + true_value]
        else:
            return [command_option + separator + false_value]
    else:
        if params[param]:
            return [command_option, true_value]
        else:
            return [command_option, false_value]
```

With this correction, the function properly handles the case where the `param` is a boolean and the case where the `separator` is provided. This should address the bug and prevent the errors described in the GitHub issue.
