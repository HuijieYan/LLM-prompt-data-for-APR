The potential error within the buggy function lies in the assertion `assert isinstance(param, bool)`. This assertion assumes that the param will always be of type bool, which is not always the case. When the function is called with different input parameters, the assertion may fail, leading to the function not working as expected.

The bug occurs because the function assumes that the input parameter `param` will always be of type bool, but in reality, it is fetched from the `params` dictionary, which may not always guarantee a boolean value. This assumption leads to the assertion error and causes the function to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the assertion and instead handle the case where the parameter may not be a boolean value. We can use a conditional check to determine the type of `param` and handle it accordingly.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def cli_bool_option(params, command_option, param, true_value='true', false_value='false', separator=None):
    param_value = params.get(param)
    if isinstance(param_value, bool):
        if separator:
            return [command_option + separator + (true_value if param_value else false_value)]
        else:
            return [command_option, true_value if param_value else false_value]
    else:
        # Handle the case when the param is not a boolean
        print("Parameter {} is not a boolean".format(param))
        return None
```

In this corrected version of the function, we first fetch the value of `param` from the `params` dictionary and store it in `param_value`. We then check if `param_value` is of type bool, and if so, we proceed with the logic for adding the command option. If `param_value` is not a boolean, we handle this case separately by printing a message and returning None. This allows for more flexibility in handling different types of input parameters.
