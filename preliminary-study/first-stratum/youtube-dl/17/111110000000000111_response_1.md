1. The error message indicates that the `cli_bool_option` function fails when the `separator` parameter is `None`, as it does not handle this case properly.

2. The potential error location within the `cli_bool_option` function is the if statement that checks if `separator` is not None. This is where the bug seems to be occurring.

3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function does not handle the case when `separator` is `None` properly. It attempts to construct a list with a separator when `separator` is not None, but it should simply construct a list with the command_option and the correct param value.

4. One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the if statement to construct the list based on the value of `separator`. If `separator` is not None, then construct the list with the separator and values, otherwise construct the list with just the command_option and param value.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def cli_bool_option(params, command_option, param, true_value='true', false_value='false', separator=None):
    param = params.get(param)
    assert isinstance(param, bool)
    if separator is not None:
        return [command_option + separator + (true_value if param else false_value)]
    return [command_option, true_value if param else false_value]
```
