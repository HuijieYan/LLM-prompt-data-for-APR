The buggy function `cli_bool_option` is designed to create a command-line option based on a boolean parameter. It takes into account whether a separator is specified and selects the appropriate true or false value. The function is failing to handle the cases where the separator is not specified or when the input parameter is not a boolean.

The potential error location is in the conditional statement `if separator:`. If no separator is specified, it should return the command_option and true/false values as separate elements in the list. However, the current implementation combines them as a single string when the separator is not specified.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function does not handle the cases where there is no separator properly. It assumes that the values will always be separated, which leads to incorrect formatting.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the implementation of the function to handle cases where the separator is not specified and to check the type of the parameter before processing. Additionally, we need to update the test cases to cover all possible scenarios.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def cli_bool_option(params, command_option, param, true_value='true', false_value='false', separator=None):
    param = params.get(param)
    if not isinstance(param, bool):
        raise TypeError("Parameter must be a boolean")
    
    if separator:
        return [command_option + separator + (true_value if param else false_value)]
    return [command_option, true_value if param else false_value]
```

With these changes, the function will now properly handle cases where there is no separator specified and will also check the parameter type before processing.

Additionally, the test cases should be updated to cover these scenarios to ensure the corrected function works as expected.
