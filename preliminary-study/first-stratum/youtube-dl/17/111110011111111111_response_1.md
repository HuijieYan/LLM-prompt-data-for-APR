The error occurs when the `cli_bool_option` function is called with an empty dictionary for the `params` parameter. This causes the `param` variable to be `None`, which leads to the assertion error because the code is trying to check if `param` is a bool.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to handle the case where `param` is `None` by returning an empty list. Additionally, we can also remove the assertion check for the type of `param`, as it is not necessary for the function to work correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `cli_bool_option` function:

```python
def cli_bool_option(params, command_option, param, true_value='true', false_value='false', separator=None):
    param = params.get(param)
    if param is None:
        return []

    if separator:
        return [command_option + separator + (true_value if param else false_value)]
    return [command_option, true_value if param else false_value]
```

This corrected code should handle the case where the `params` dictionary is empty and no value is found for the `param`. It also removes the unnecessary assertion check for the type of `param`.
