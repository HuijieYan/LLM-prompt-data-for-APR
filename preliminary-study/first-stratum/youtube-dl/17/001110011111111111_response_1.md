The error occurs because the function `cli_bool_option` is assuming that the `param` variable will always exist in the `params` dictionary. This is not the case when the `param` key is not present in the `params` dictionary. In this situation, the `param` variable becomes `None`, and the function tries to assert its type as a boolean, leading to an assertion error.

To fix this issue, the function needs to handle the case where the `param` key is not present in the `params` dictionary. This can be done by checking if the `param` key exists before trying to retrieve its value.

Here's the corrected code for the `cli_bool_option` function:

```python
def cli_bool_option(params, command_option, param, true_value='true', false_value='false', separator=None):
    param = params.get(param)
    if param is not None:  # Check if param key exists in the params dictionary
        assert isinstance(param, bool)
        if separator:
            return [command_option + separator + (true_value if param else false_value)]
        return [command_option, true_value if param else false_value]
    else:
        return []  # Return an empty list if param key is not present in the params dictionary
```

By adding a check for the existence of the `param` key in the `params` dictionary, the function will no longer throw an assertion error when the `param` key is not present.

This fix will ensure that the function can handle cases where the `param` key is not present in the `params` dictionary, as observed in the test function where an empty dictionary is passed as the `params` input.
