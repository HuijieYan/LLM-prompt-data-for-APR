The potential error is occurring in the line `param = params.get(param)` because the `get` method returns `None` when the key is not found in the dictionary, which is causing the `assert isinstance(param, bool)` statement to fail.

The reason behind the bug is that the `get` method returns `None` if the key is not found, and we are directly assigning this value to `param` without checking its type.

To fix the bug, we can modify the code to explicitly check if the key exists in the dictionary. If the key exists, we can then check its type and proceed accordingly. If the key does not exist, we can handle this case appropriately based on the requirements of the function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def cli_bool_option(params, command_option, param, true_value='true', false_value='false', separator=None):
    if param in params:
        param = params[param]
        assert isinstance(param, bool)
        if separator:
            return [command_option + separator + (true_value if param else false_value)]
        return [command_option, true_value if param else false_value]
    else:
        # Handle the case when the key does not exist in the dictionary
        # For example, return an error message or handle the default value for param
```
