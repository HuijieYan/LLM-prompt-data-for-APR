The potential error location within the problematic function is in the line "param = params.get(param)" where the function is trying to retrieve the value of the parameter "param" from the dictionary "params". The error seems to be occurring because the function is assuming that the value of "param" will always be a boolean and using the "assert isinstance(param, bool)" line to check for this. However, the error message from the GitHub issue suggests that the value of "continuedl" is None, which means it is not a boolean but rather a NoneType.

To fix this bug, the function should not assume that the value of "param" will always be a boolean. It should instead check if the value is a boolean and handle the case where it is not.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def cli_bool_option(params, command_option, param, true_value='true', false_value='false', separator=None):
    param = params.get(param)
    if param is not None:
        if isinstance(param, bool):
            if separator:
                return [command_option + separator + (true_value if param else false_value)]
            return [command_option, true_value if param else false_value]
    return []
```
This corrected code checks if the value of "param" is not None and is a boolean, and then proceeds with the necessary logic to return the command option. If the value of "param" is None or not a boolean, it returns an empty list.
