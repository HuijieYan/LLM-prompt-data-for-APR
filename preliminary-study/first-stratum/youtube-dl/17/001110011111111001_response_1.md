The potential error location within the problematic function is the `assert isinstance(param, bool)` line. This line assumes that the `param` variable is already a boolean when it checks its type. However, this is not always the case because the `param` variable is retrieved from a dictionary and might not have the correct type.

The bug is occurring because the function assumes that the `param` variable is already of type `bool` when it checks its type using `isinstance(param, bool)`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to explicitly handle the cases where the `param` variable is not already a boolean. We can check the type of the `param` variable before assuming it is a boolean, and cast it to a boolean if necessary.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def cli_bool_option(params, command_option, param, true_value='true', false_value='false', separator=None):
    param = params.get(param)
    if param is not None:
        param = param.lower()  # Convert the param to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison
        if param in ['true', '1', 'yes']:
            if separator:
                return [command_option + separator + true_value]
            return [command_option, true_value]
        elif param in ['false', '0', 'no']:
            if separator:
                return [command_option + separator + false_value]
            return [command_option, false_value]
        else:
            # Handle cases where the param is not a recognized boolean value
            raise ValueError("Invalid boolean value for param")
    else:
        # Handle cases where the param is not present in the params dictionary
        return []

```

This approach ensures that the `param` variable is explicitly handled to account for different cases, including when it is not a boolean. By using this approach, the function will be able to handle various input values and types, and the bug should be fixed.
