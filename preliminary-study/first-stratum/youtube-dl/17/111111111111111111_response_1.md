The test case that fails is the one where the `param` value is not present in the `params` dictionary, which results in `param` being `None`. The function then tries to check if `param` is of type `bool`, which will cause an `AssertionError` since `None` is not of type `bool`.

The bug occurs because the function asserts that the `param` variable is of type `bool` without considering the case where the `param` value is not present in the `params` dictionary.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the `param` value is present in the `params` dictionary before asserting its type. If the `param` value is not present, we can assume it to be `False` (i.e., not set).

Here's the corrected code for the `cli_bool_option` function:

```python
def cli_bool_option(params, command_option, param, true_value='true', false_value='false', separator=None):
    param = params.get(param, False)  # Assign False if param is not present in params
    if separator:
        return [command_option + separator + (true_value if param else false_value)]
    return [command_option, true_value if param else false_value]
```

With this correction, the function will not raise an `AssertionError` when the `param` value is not present in the `params` dictionary. Instead, it will default to `False` in that case.
