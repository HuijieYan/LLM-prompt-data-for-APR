The test case "test_cli_bool_option" is testing the "cli_bool_option" function with different input parameters and checking if the output matches the expected output.

The error message indicates that the function is trying to access a boolean value from the "params" dictionary, but it is receiving a "None" value instead. This causes the "assert isinstance(param, bool)" statement to fail because "param" is not a boolean.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case when the "param" key is not present in the "params" dictionary, which results in "param" being set to "None".

To fix the bug, we need to check if the "param" key is present in the "params" dictionary. If it is not present, we can set a default value for "param".

Here's the corrected code for the "cli_bool_option" function:

```python
def cli_bool_option(params, command_option, param, true_value='true', false_value='false', separator=None):
    param = params.get(param, False)  # Set a default value if param is not present
    assert isinstance(param, bool)
    if separator:
        return [command_option + separator + (true_value if param else false_value)]
    return [command_option, true_value if param else false_value]
```

With this fix, if the "param" key is not present in the "params" dictionary, it defaults to False. This prevents the function from trying to access a boolean value from a None value, therefore resolving the issue.
