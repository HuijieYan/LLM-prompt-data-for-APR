The error occurs because the `param` variable is being checked for its type using the `isinstance()` function to see if it is a boolean, but the variable is being fetched from a dictionary and may not always be a boolean. This causes the assertion error when the variable is not a boolean.

To fix this bug, we can check if the `param` variable exists in the dictionary and then perform the boolean check. If the variable is not present in the dictionary, we can assume it to be False. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def cli_bool_option(params, command_option, param, true_value='true', false_value='false', separator=None):
    param = params.get(param)
    if param is not None:
        if isinstance(param, bool):
            if separator:
                return [command_option + separator + (true_value if param else false_value)]
            return [command_option, true_value if param else false_value]
    return []
```

In this corrected code, we first check if the `param` variable exists in the dictionary. If it does, then we proceed to check if it is a boolean. If it is a boolean, we return the appropriate value based on the presence of the `separator`. If the `param` does not exist in the dictionary, we return an empty list.

This code should fix the bug and ensure that the function works as intended for the given test cases.
