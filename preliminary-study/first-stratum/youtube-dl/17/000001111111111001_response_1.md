The error is occurring in the buggy function `cli_bool_option` in the line `assert isinstance(param, bool)`. This assertion is causing the function to fail when the `param` is `None`, which happens when the key specified by the `param` variable is not present in the `params` dictionary.

The buggy function is assuming that the `param` key is always present in the `params` dictionary and is of type boolean. To fix this, we need to check if the `param` key is present in the `params` dictionary and handle the case where it is not present.

Here's the corrected code for the `cli_bool_option` function:

```python
def cli_bool_option(params, command_option, param, true_value='true', false_value='false', separator=None):
    param = params.get(param)
    
    if param is not None:
        assert isinstance(param, bool)
        if separator:
            return [command_option + separator + (true_value if param else false_value)]
        return [command_option, true_value if param else false_value]
    else:
        return []
```

With this modification, the function will handle the case where the `param` key is not present in the `params` dictionary and return an empty list in that case. This should fix the bug and allow the test cases to pass without triggering the assertion error.
