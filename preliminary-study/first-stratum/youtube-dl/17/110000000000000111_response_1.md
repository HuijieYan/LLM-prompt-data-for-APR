1. The test case appears to be related to a specific scenario where an error occurs when using the external_downloader "curl" without explicitly specifying the "continuedl" parameter.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the "cli_bool_option" function.

3. The bug occurs because the "cli_bool_option" function does not handle the case where the "param" value is None, and it does not check for the existence of the "param" before trying to assert its type as a boolean.

4. To fix the bug, we need to add a check for the existence of the "param" before asserting its type and provide a default value for the "param" in case it is None. Additionally, we should handle the case where "separator" is None and return the correct format for the command_option and its value.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def cli_bool_option(params, command_option, param, true_value='true', false_value='false', separator=None):
    if param in params:
        param = params[param]
        if param is not None and isinstance(param, bool):
            if separator:
                return [command_option + separator + (true_value if param else false_value)]
            return [command_option, true_value if param else false_value]
    return []
```

With the corrected function, we first check if the "param" exists in the "params" dictionary. If it does, we retrieve its value and then check if the value is not None and is of type bool. If these conditions are met, we then proceed to construct the return value based on the provided parameters. If any of the conditions are not met, we simply return an empty list.
