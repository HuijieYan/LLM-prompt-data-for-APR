The error message indicates that the assert statement `assert isinstance(param, bool)` is failing, which means that the `param` variable is not of type bool as expected.

The potential error location within the code is the `assert isinstance(param, bool)` line in the `cli_bool_option` function.

The bug occurs because the `param` value is retrieved using `params.get(param)`, which may result in a None value if the parameter is not present in the `params` dictionary. The `assert isinstance(param, bool)` statement does not account for this possibility and assumes that `param` will always be a boolean value.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle the case where `param` is None. We can assume that if `param` is None, the intended behavior is to return an empty list.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def cli_bool_option(params, command_option, param, true_value='true', false_value='false', separator=None):
    param = params.get(param)
    if param is not None:
        assert isinstance(param, bool)
    else:
        return []

    if separator:
        return [command_option + separator + (true_value if param else false_value)]
    return [command_option, true_value if param else false_value]
```

By checking if `param` is not None before asserting its type, we can handle the case where the parameter is not present in the `params` dictionary. If it is not present, we simply return an empty list as intended.

This should resolve the bug and allow the function to handle the various input scenarios correctly.
