Potential Error:
The error in the code is that the function assumes the 'param' value to be a boolean, but it does not handle cases where 'param' may not exist in the 'params' dictionary. This can result in a NoneType object being returned by 'params.get(param)', leading to an error when asserting its type to be a boolean.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where the 'param' key may not exist in the 'params' dictionary. This can cause the 'param' variable to be assigned a value of None, which then leads to the assert statement failing due to the NoneType not being an instance of a boolean.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the 'param' exists in the 'params' dictionary and handle the case where it may not exist.
2. If the 'param' does not exist, consider it as False or handle it with a default value.

Corrected Code:
```python
def cli_bool_option(params, command_option, param, true_value='true', false_value='false', separator=None):
    param = params.get(param, False)  # Provide a default value if param doesn't exist
    if not isinstance(param, bool):
        param = False  # Consider the param as False if it's not a boolean
    if separator:
        return [command_option + separator + (true_value if param else false_value)]
    return [command_option, true_value if param else false_value]
```
