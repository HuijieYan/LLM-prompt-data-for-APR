The bug in the `cli_bool_option` function is that it assumes that the `param` value will always be a boolean, which is not the case. Looking at the error message from the test function, the issue occurs when the `param` value is not present in the `params` dictionary, causing it to be `None`.

The reason behind the bug is that the function assumes the `param` value will always be present in the `params` dictionary and will always be a boolean. This assumption leads to the assertion error when `param` is not present in the `params` dictionary.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to handle cases where the `param` value is not present in the `params` dictionary. We should also check for the presence of the `param` in the `params` dictionary before attempting to retrieve its value.

Here's the corrected code for the `cli_bool_option` function:

```python
def cli_bool_option(params, command_option, param, true_value='true', false_value='false', separator=None):
    if param in params:
        param = params[param]
        if separator:
            return [command_option + separator + (true_value if param else false_value)]
        return [command_option, true_value if param else false_value]
    return []
```

By checking for the presence of the `param` in the `params` dictionary before using it, we prevent the error caused by assuming its presence. If the `param` is not present, the function returns an empty list, as shown in the last test case of the test function.
