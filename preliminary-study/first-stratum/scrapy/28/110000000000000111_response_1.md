Potential error location: The error occurs in the `__init__` method where the `self.file` is being initialized.

Reason for the bug: The bug occurs because the `self.file` is being initialized as `None` first and then a file is being opened and assigned to it. However, if an error occurs while trying to open the file, the code will not handle the exception and may result in unexpected behavior.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, we can use a `try-except` block to handle the exception that may occur when opening the file. This way, we can handle any errors that occur and prevent unexpected behavior.

Corrected code:

```python
import os
import logging

class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            try:
                self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
                self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
            except Exception as e:
                self.logger.error(f"Error opening file: {e}")
```
