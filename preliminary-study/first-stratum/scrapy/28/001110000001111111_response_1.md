The potential error in the code is with the line:
```python
self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```
The bug occurs because the file pointer is not at the beginning of the file. When attempting to read the file, it reads from the current position of the file pointer, which is at the end in append mode. Therefore, it doesn't read anything from the file.

To fix this bug, we need to move the file pointer to the beginning of the file before reading it.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic "RFPDupeFilter" function:

```python
def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
    self.file = None
    self.fingerprints = set()
    self.logdupes = True
    self.debug = debug
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    if path:
        self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
        self.file.seek(0)  # Move the file pointer to the beginning of the file
        self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```
By adding the line `self.file.seek(0)`, we move the file pointer to the beginning of the file before reading, which will fix the bug.
