The error message is indicating that the `request_seen()` method of the `RFPDupeFilter` class is not behaving as expected. The `request_seen()` method is used to check if a request has been seen before.

Looking at the `__init__` method of the `RFPDupeFilter` class, the bug seems to be related to the initialization of the `self.file` and `self.fingerprints` attributes. The `self.file` should be opened in read mode to populate the `self.fingerprints` set, but it's currently opened in append mode. Additionally, the `self.fingerprints` should be updated with the existing fingerprints from the file.

The bug is occurring because when an instance of `RFPDupeFilter` is created, the file is opened in append mode, and the existing fingerprints are not read and stored in the `self.fingerprints` set.

To fix the bug, the `__init__` method of the `RFPDupeFilter` class should be modified as follows:

```python
import os
import logging

class RFPDupeFilter:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            file_path = os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen')
            if os.path.exists(file_path):
                with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
                    self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in file)
                    self.file = file
            else:
                self.file = open(file_path, 'a+')
```

In the modified code:
- The file is first checked if it exists. If it does, it is opened in read mode and the existing fingerprints are updated in the `self.fingerprints` set.
- If the file doesn't exist, it is created.
- The file is opened using a context manager (`with open(...) as file`) to ensure proper handling of file resources.

After making these changes, the `request_seen()` method should behave as expected without causing the assertion error in the test case.
