Potential error location: The error might occur in the `__init__` method while trying to open and read from a file.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: 
1. The `open` method is not properly handling potential file-related errors, such as file not found, permissions issues, or other IO errors.
2. The code does not properly handle the file object - it should be closed after it is no longer needed.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use a try-except block to handle potential file-related errors when opening the file.
2. Use a `with open()` block to ensure that the file is properly closed after its operations are completed.

Corrected code:

```python
import os
import logging

class YourClassName:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            try:
                with open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+') as file:
                    self.file = file
                    self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
            except FileNotFoundError:
                print("File not found")
            except PermissionError:
                print("Permission denied")
```
