Potential Error: The `open` function is used to open a file, but it is not being closed properly after its use.

Reason for the Bug: The file object is not explicitly closed after being opened, which can lead to resource leaks and potential data corruption.

Possible Fix: Use the `with` statement to ensure proper handling of the file object, which will automatically close the file after its suite finishes, even if an exception is raised.

Corrected Code:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class RFPDupeFilter(BaseDupeFilter):
    """
    Request Fingerprint duplicates filter
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # the corrected function
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            with open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+') as file:
                self.file = file
                self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```
