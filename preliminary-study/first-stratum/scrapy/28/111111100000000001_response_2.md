Potential error location: The potential error in the given code is in the initialization of the `self.fingerprints` set. As currently implemented, it does not correctly read the contents of the file and update the set with the existing fingerprints.

Reason for the bug: The bug occurs because the code is trying to update the set of fingerprints from the file, but it does not correctly read the file contents.

Possible approach to fix the bug: To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the file is properly read and its contents are used to update the set of fingerprints.

Corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_28/scrapy/dupefilters.py

# class declaration containing the corrected function
class RFPDupeFilter(BaseDupeFilter):
    """
    Request Fingerprint duplicates filter
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # corrected function
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            with open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+') as file:
                file.seek(0)
                self.fingerprints.update(x.strip() for x in file)
```
