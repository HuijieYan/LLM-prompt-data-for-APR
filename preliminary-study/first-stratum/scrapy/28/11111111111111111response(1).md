Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the initialization of the RFPDupeFilter class, specifically with the handling of the 'path' parameter.

Reasons for the occurrence of the bug: The bug may be occurring because the file at the specified path is not being properly read, leading to unexpected behavior in the request_seen function of the RFPDupeFilter class.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Ensure that the file at the specified path is being properly read and its contents are being loaded into the 'fingerprints' set.
2. Check for any potential issues with file permissions or file existence at the specified path.
3. Handle any potential exceptions that may arise from file I/O operations.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import os
import logging

class RFPDupeFilter(BaseDupeFilter):
    """
    Request Fingerprint duplicates filter
    """

    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            try:
                if os.path.exists(path):  # Check if path exists
                    with open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'r') as file:
                        self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in file)
                else:
                    self.logger.warning(f"Path {path} does not exist")
            except Exception as e:
                self.logger.error(f"Error reading file at path {path}: {e}")
```

In the corrected code, the file reading operation is wrapped in a try-except block to handle potential file I/O exceptions. It checks if the path exists before attempting to open the file, and logs a warning if the path does not exist. It also logs any errors encountered during file reading. These changes aim to improve the robustness of the file reading process and provide better error handling.
