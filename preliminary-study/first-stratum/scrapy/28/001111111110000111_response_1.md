The test case creates two requests `r1` and `r2`, and then creates an instance of `RFPDupeFilter` with a temporary path. It then checks if the `request_seen` function behaves as expected when called with `r1` and `r2`. The error occurs when asserting that `df2.request_seen(r1)` should return `True`, but it returns `False`.

The potential error location within the `RFPDupeFilter` class is the `__init__` function where it initializes the `set` of `fingerprints`. The bug seems to be related to the initialization of these fingerprint sets from an existing file.

The bug occurs because the `self.file` is not being closed after it has been opened, and this leads to the file not being flushed properly, causing an issue with the initialization of the `fingerprints` set.

To fix the bug, the `__init__` function of the `RFPDupeFilter` class needs to be modified to properly close the file after it has been opened. Additionally, it's good practice to use the `with` statement to handle file opening and closing to ensure that it's done correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` function:

```python
class RFPDupeFilter(BaseDupeFilter):
    """
    Request Fingerprint duplicates filter
    """

    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

        if path:
            with open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+') as file:
                self.file = file
                self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in file)
```

With these changes, the file is properly closed after it has been opened, ensuring that the `fingerprints` set is initialized correctly.
