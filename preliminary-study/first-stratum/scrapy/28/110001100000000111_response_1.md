The potential error in the `__init__` method is the incorrect initialization of the `self.file` attribute. The 'requests.seen' file should be opened in `r` mode rather than `a+` mode to prevent creating a new file if it doesn't exist.

The bug occurs because the file is being opened in 'a+' mode, which creates a new file if it doesn't exist. This could result in overwriting existing data or creating a new file when the intention is to open an existing file in read mode.

To fix this bug, the file should be opened in 'r' mode to prevent creating a new file. Additionally, the file should be closed after reading the existing fingerprints to prevent resource leaks.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import os

class ClassName:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            with open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'r') as file:
                self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in file)
```
