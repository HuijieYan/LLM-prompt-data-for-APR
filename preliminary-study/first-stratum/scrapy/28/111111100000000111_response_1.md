The potential error in the given code is that it does not handle the file properly. 

The bug occurs because the code tries to read from a file that has not been opened. Additionally, when the file is opened, the read cursor is at the end of the file. Therefore, when trying to read the file, it will return an empty string. 

To fix the bug, the code needs to open the file in read mode and then iterate over the lines to update the fingerprints set.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            try:
                with open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'r') as file:
                    self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in file)
            except FileNotFoundError:
                pass
```
