The error message indicates that the test function is failing when it checks if a request has been seen by the dupe filter. The bug seems to be related to the initialization of the `RFPDupeFilter` class in the `__init__` method.

The potential error is in the lines of code where the file is being opened and read. Specifically, the issue seems to be with the `self.file` object and the `self.fingerprints` set not being initialized properly in the `__init__` method.

The bug occurs because the `__init__` method does not properly handle the initialization of the `self.file` and `self.fingerprints` attributes. This results in the `df2.request_seen(r1)` assertion failing in the test function because the request is not correctly identified as seen.

To fix the bug, the `__init__` method should properly initialize the `self.file` and `self.fingerprints` attributes to avoid the error in the test function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import os
import logging

class RFPDupeFilter:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.file_path = os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen')
            if os.path.exists(self.file_path):
                with open(self.file_path, 'r') as file:
                    self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in file.readlines())

    def open(self):
        if self.file_path:
            self.file = open(self.file_path, 'a+')

    def close(self, message):
        if self.file:
            self.file.close()

    def request_seen(self, request):
        return request.url in self.fingerprints
```

In the corrected code, the `__init__` method properly initializes the `self.file` and `self.fingerprints` attributes by checking if the file exists and then reading its contents. Additionally, I added the `open` and `close` methods for handling file operations, and `request_seen` method for checking if a request has been seen.
