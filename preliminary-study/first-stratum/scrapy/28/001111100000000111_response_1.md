Potential error location:
The potential error is in the line:
self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)

Reason for the bug:
The bug occurs because the code is trying to update the set "self.fingerprints" with the lines from the file "self.file" without first checking if the file has been opened for reading. This can lead to errors if the file has not been properly opened for reading.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add a check to ensure that the file has been opened before attempting to update the fingerprints set.
2. Handle any potential file opening errors to prevent the code from crashing.

Corrected code:

```python
def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
    self.file = None
    self.fingerprints = set()
    self.logdupes = True
    self.debug = debug
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    if path:
        try:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
        except Exception as e:
            # Handle any potential file opening errors
            self.logger.error(f"Error opening file: {e}")
            if self.file:
                self.file.close()
```
