The error seems to be related to the `request_seen` method of the `RFPDupeFilter` class. The test is failing at `assert df2.request_seen(r1)` which means that the `request_seen` method is not functioning as expected.

The potential error is within the `__init__` method of the `RFPDupeFilter` class, specifically the part where it tries to update the `fingerprints` set from a file.

The bug is occurring because the file is being read but not reset to the beginning before trying to update the `fingerprints` set. As a result, the set is not being updated correctly and is causing the `request_seen` method to behave unexpectedly.

To fix the bug, the file cursor needs to be reset to the beginning before attempting to update the `fingerprints` set.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
import os
import logging

class RFPDupeFilter:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
            self.file.seek(0)  # reset file cursor to the beginning
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```

By adding `self.file.seek(0)` before updating the `fingerprints` set, we ensure that the file cursor is at the beginning before reading and updating the set. This should fix the bug and make the `request_seen` method work correctly.
