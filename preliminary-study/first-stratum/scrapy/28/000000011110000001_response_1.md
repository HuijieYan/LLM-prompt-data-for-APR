Potential error location:
The error likely occurs in the `__init__` method of the `RFPDupeFilter` class, specifically in the block that initializes the file and fingerprints.

Reason behind the bug:
The bug is likely caused by the `open()` method not properly reading the contents of the file and updating the fingerprints set.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
We need to ensure that the file is properly read and its contents are used to update the fingerprints set.

Corrected code:

```python
import logging
import os

class RFPDupeFilter:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
            self.fingerprints.update(x.strip() for x in self.file.readlines())
            self.file.seek(0)  # Reset file pointer to beginning for future reads
            self.file.close()
```
In the corrected code, after updating the `fingerprints` set, the file pointer is reset to the beginning of the file using `seek(0)` and then the file is closed. This ensures that the file is properly read, and its contents are used to update the `fingerprints` set.
