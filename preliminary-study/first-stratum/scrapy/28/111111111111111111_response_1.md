The test function is creating a temporary directory using `tempfile.mkdtemp()` and then instantiating the `RFPDupeFilter` class with this path. It then performs some requests and checks whether they have been seen before or not.

The issue seems to be with the `RFPDupeFilter` class not correctly initializing the `self.file` and `self.fingerprints` variables. The `__init__` method is trying to read from an existing file, but it's not correctly adding the fingerprints to the set.

The bug occurs because the `__init__` method is not correctly reading the existing file and updating the `self.fingerprints` set with the fingerprints from the file.

To fix this, the `__init__` method needs to correctly read the existing file and update the `self.fingerprints` set with the fingerprints from the file.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
    self.file = None
    self.fingerprints = set()
    self.logdupes = True
    self.debug = debug
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

    if path:
        try:
            with open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'r') as file:
                self.fingerprints.update(x.strip() for x in file)
        except FileNotFoundError:
            pass
```

This corrected code uses a `with` statement to open and read the file, and it also handles the case where the file doesn't exist. This should resolve the bug and make the test function pass without errors.
