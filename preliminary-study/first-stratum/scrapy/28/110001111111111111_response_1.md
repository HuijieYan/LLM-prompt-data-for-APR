The error message indicates that the `request_seen` method of the `RFPDupeFilter` class is not working as expected. It is failing to detect whether a request has been seen before, which is indicated by the `assert df2.request_seen(r1)` line in the test function.

Looking at the `__init__` method provided, the issue seems to be with the `self.fingerprints` variable not being initialized correctly. The `fingerprints` should be populated with values from the file `requests.seen`, but the logic to read from the file and populate `fingerprints` is missing.

The bug occurred because the `fingerprints` set was not being populated with values from the file when the object is initialized.

To fix this bug, we need to add the logic to read from the file and populate `fingerprints` in the `__init__` method of the `RFPDupeFilter` class.

The corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import os
import logging

class RFPDupeFilter:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            filepath = os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen')
            if os.path.exists(filepath):
                with open(filepath, 'r') as file:
                    self.fingerprints = {line.strip() for line in file.readlines()}
                self.file = open(filepath, 'a+')
            else:
                self.file = open(filepath, 'w')

    def open(self):
        pass

    def request_seen(self, request):
        fingerprint = request_fingerprint(request)
        if fingerprint in self.fingerprints:
            return True
        self.fingerprints.add(fingerprint)
        return False

    def close(self, reason):
        self.file.close()

def request_fingerprint(request):
    # Generate a unique fingerprint for the request
    return hashlib.sha1(request.url.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()

```

In the corrected code, the `__init__` method now checks if the file `requests.seen` exists in the given path. If it does, it reads the contents of the file and populates the `fingerprints` set. If the file does not exist, it creates an empty file. This ensures that `fingerprints` are initialized correctly with the values from the file.
