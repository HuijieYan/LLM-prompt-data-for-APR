Potential Error Location:
The issue lies in the initialization of the 'file' attribute within the __init__ method. The 'self.file' attribute is being initialized to None, and the program attempts to access it without first checking if it has a valid value.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the 'file' attribute is not being properly initialized before being accessed in the code. This can lead to errors when trying to use 'self.file' without first ensuring that it has been assigned a value.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to initialize the 'file' attribute before it is accessed. We can accomplish this by adding a conditional check to see if 'path' is not None before opening the file and setting the 'file' attribute.

Corrected Code:
```python
import logging
import os

class DupeFilters:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            file_path = os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen')
            if os.path.exists(file_path):
                with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
                    self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in file)
```
In the corrected code, we have added a conditional check to see if 'path' is not None before attempting to open the file. If 'path' is not None, we then open the file and update the 'fingerprints' attribute with its contents. Additionally, we have also removed the unnecessary 'a+' mode from the file opening, as it is not used in the original code.
