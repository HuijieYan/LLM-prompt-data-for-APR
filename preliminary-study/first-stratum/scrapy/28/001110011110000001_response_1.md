The test case `test_dupefilter_path` is attempting to create two instances of the `RFPDupeFilter` class with the same `path`, and then checking if the `request_seen` function works as expected for both instances.

The potential error in the `__init__` function of the `RFPDupeFilter` class is in the way it handles opening the file and updating the set of fingerprints. 

The bug occurs because when the file is opened for reading and writing at the same time, the file pointer is at the end of the file. So, when reading the file, it returns an empty string, resulting in an empty set of fingerprints.

To fix this bug, the file pointer should be reset to the beginning of the file before reading the contents.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import os
import logging

class RFPDupeFilter(BaseDupeFilter):
    """
    Request Fingerprint duplicates filter
    """

    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
            self.file.seek(0)  # Reset the file pointer to the beginning of the file
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```
