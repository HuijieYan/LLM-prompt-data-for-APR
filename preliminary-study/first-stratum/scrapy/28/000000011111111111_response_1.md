The error occurred in the `test_dupefilter_path` test case, specifically in the line `assert df2.request_seen(r1)`. The error message indicates that the `request_seen` method does not behave as expected, which is likely due to the buggy initialization of the `RFPDupeFilter` class.

The buggy function's `__init__` method does not handle the case where the file at the specified path already exists. As a result, when multiple instances of `RFPDupeFilter` are created with the same path, they end up sharing the same `requests.seen` file, leading to unexpected behavior in the `request_seen` method.

To fix this issue, the `__init__` method should be modified to ensure that it opens the file in read mode first, to populate the `fingerprints` set, and then open the file in append mode while keeping the same file pointer at the beginning of the file.

Below is the corrected code for the `__init__` method of the `RFPDupeFilter` class:

```python
import os
import logging

class RFPDupeFilter:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            requests_seen_path = os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen')
            if os.path.exists(requests_seen_path):
                with open(requests_seen_path, 'r') as f:
                    self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in f)
            self.file = open(requests_seen_path, 'a+')
```

With this modification, the `RFPDupeFilter` class will behave as expected, and the `test_dupefilter_path` test case should pass without any AssertionErrors.
