There is a potential problem with the function `__init__` in the `RFPDupeFilter` class. The bug stems from the use of `open` without proper error handling. If the file specified by the `path` argument does not exist, the function will raise an error and fail to initialize the `self.file` attribute.

To fix this issue, error handling should be added to ensure that the file is opened correctly and to handle any potential errors.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
    self.file = None
    self.fingerprints = set()
    self.logdupes = True
    self.debug = debug
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    if path:
        try:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
        except FileNotFoundError:
            # Handle the FileNotFoundError if the file does not exist
            pass
```

In the corrected code, a `try-except` block is used to catch the `FileNotFoundError` if the file specified by the `path` argument does not exist. If the file does not exist, the error is caught and handled, allowing the function to continue without raising an error.
