The error message indicates that the `request_seen` method of the `RFPDupeFilter` class is not behaving as expected. The `assert df2.request_seen(r1)` statement is raising an `AssertionError`, suggesting that the `request_seen` method incorrectly returns `True` for `r1` when it should have returned `False.

The potential error location within the `__init__` method of the `RFPDupeFilter` class is the `self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)` line. It seems that the fingerprints are not being loaded correctly from the file.

The bug likely occurs because the file is not being read correctly to populate the `self.fingerprints` set with the existing fingerprints when the `RFPDupeFilter` instance is created.

To fix the bug, the file should be read and its contents should be used to initialize the `self.fingerprints` set. Additionally, it's important to ensure that the file is closed after reading.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
    self.file = None
    self.fingerprints = set()
    self.logdupes = True
    self.debug = debug
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    if path:
        try:
            with open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'r') as file:
                self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in file)
        except FileNotFoundError:
            pass  # If the file does not exist, fingerprints will be empty
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error reading file: {e}")
            # Handle the error as per your application's requirements
```

This code uses a `try-except` block to handle the cases where the file does not exist or if there is an error while reading the file. It also uses the `with` statement to ensure that the file is properly closed after reading.
