Potential error location:
The line `self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')` could be causing the issue.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug might be caused by the `open` function that opens the file in append and read mode ('a+'). This can lead to the file pointer being positioned at the end of the file, causing the subsequent `self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)` to read nothing from the file, resulting in an empty set of fingerprints.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the file pointer is positioned at the beginning of the file before reading its contents.
2. Use a different file mode for opening the file to ensure that the file contents can be read properly.

The corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import os
import logging

class RFPDupeFilter:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'r+')
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)

    def open(self):
        if self.file:
            self.file.close()
        if self.debug:
            self.logger.debug("Opened db at %s", self.file.name)
        self.file = open(self.file.name, 'a+')

    def request_seen(self, request):
        fp = request_fingerprint(request)
        if fp in self.fingerprints:
            return True
        self.fingerprints.add(fp)
        self.file.write(fp + os.linesep)
        return False

    def close(self, reason):
        if hasattr(self.file, 'close'):
            self.file.close()
