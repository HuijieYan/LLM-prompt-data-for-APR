Potential error location: The bug seems to be occurring in the initialization of the RFPDupeFilter class. Specifically, the issue lies in the __init__ method where the file is being opened but not closed properly.

Reasons for the bug: The bug occurs because the file is being opened but not closed within the __init__ method. This can lead to resource leaks and improper handling of the file.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Open the file using the "with" statement to ensure proper handling and closing of the file.
2. Add error handling in case the file cannot be opened.

Corrected code:

```python
import os
import logging
from scrapy.dupefilters import BaseDupeFilter

class RFPDupeFilter(BaseDupeFilter):
    """
    Request Fingerprint duplicates filter
    """

    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            try:
                with open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+') as file:
                    self.file = file
                    self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
            except Exception as e:
                self.logger.error("Error opening requests.seen file: %s" % str(e))
```
