Potential error location:
The potential error location is in the `__init__` method where the `self.file` variable is being assigned to a file object.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the `open` function is being used to open a file, but the file is not being properly closed. This can lead to resource leaks and potential data loss.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix this bug, we need to make sure that the file is closed properly after it has been used. This can be done by using a `try/finally` block to ensure that the file is closed even if an exception occurs.

Corrected code:
```python
import os
import logging

class DupeFilters():
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            try:
                self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
                self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
            finally:
                if self.file:
                    self.file.close()
```
