The potential error location in the provided code is in the initialization of the `self.file` variable. It seems that the code appends an incorrect path to the requests.seen file.

The bug occurs because the method is trying to open a file for appending without checking if the file exists. This results in errors when trying to read from or write to the file.

One approach to fixing this bug is to add a check to see if the file exists before opening it in 'a+' mode. If the file does not exist, it can be created. Additionally, the file should be closed after it's done being used to ensure proper resource management.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import os

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_28/scrapy/dupefilters.py

# corrected function
def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
    self.file = None
    self.fingerprints = set()
    self.logdupes = True
    self.debug = debug
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    if path:
        file_path = os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen')
        if os.path.exists(file_path):
            self.file = open(file_path, 'a+')
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
        else:
            self.file = open(file_path, 'w+')
```
