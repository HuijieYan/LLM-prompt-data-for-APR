The bug seems to be in the `__init__` method of the `RFPDupeFilter` class. The issue arises from the way the `requests.seen` file is being opened and read.

The bug occurs because the code only reads from the file when it is opened but does not rewind the file back to the beginning. As a result, when `self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)` is executed, it doesn't read any lines because the file pointer is at the end of the file.

To fix this bug, the file pointer needs to be rewound to the beginning of the file before reading it. Additionally, it's a good practice to close the file after reading from it.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
import os
import logging

class RFPDupeFilter(BaseDupeFilter):
    """
    Request Fingerprint duplicates filter
    """

    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        
        if path:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
            self.file.seek(0)  # Rewind the file pointer to the beginning
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
            self.file.close()  # Close the file after reading
```

With these changes, the `requests.seen` file will be properly read when the `RFPDupeFilter` object is initialized, and the test case should pass without any assertion errors.
