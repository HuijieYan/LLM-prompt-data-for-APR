The provided function is the constructor of a class, as indicated by the use of `__init__`. It initializes several class attributes and reads contents from a file if a path is provided.

The bug in this code is that it is not properly handling the case when the file at the provided path does not exist. Additionally, it does not close the file after reading from it.

To fix the bug, we should use a context manager (`with` statement) to open the file which will also handle the closing of the file. Additionally, we should handle the case when the file does not exist by creating the file if it doesn't exist.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
import os
import logging

class ClassName:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

        if path:
            file_path = os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen')
            if not os.path.exists(file_path):
                open(file_path, 'w').close()  # Create the file if it doesn't exist
            with open(file_path, 'a+') as file:
                self.file = file
                self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```
