The potential error in the provided function is the use of `self.file` and `self.fingerprints`. Despite initializing the `self.file` as `None` and `self.fingerprints` as an empty set, the code later assigns values to them without checking if they are still in their initial state. This causes the function to behave unexpectedly due to the initial values not being properly handled.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the code inside the `__init__` function to ensure that if `self.file` and `self.fingerprints` are still in their initial state, then proceed to assign new values to them.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import os
import logging

class ClassName:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        self.logdupes = True
        
        if path:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
            if self.file:
                self.fingerprints = set(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
            else:
                self.fingerprints = set()
```
