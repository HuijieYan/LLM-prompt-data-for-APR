The potential error in the provided code is that the file is not being closed after it is opened, which can lead to resource leaks and could potentially cause issues with the file not being properly saved.

The code should be modified to ensure that the file is closed after it is opened, in order to prevent any resource leaks.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class RFPDupeFilter(BaseDupeFilter):
    """
    Request Fingerprint duplicates filter
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
            self.file.close()
```
