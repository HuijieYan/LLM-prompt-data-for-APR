Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the line `self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)`. This line is attempting to update the set `self.fingerprints` with the stripped lines from the file, but it is not taking into account that the file pointer is not at the beginning of the file.

Reason for the bug: The bug is occurring because the file pointer is not at the beginning of the file when attempting to read the lines, so it is not reading any content from the file.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: The file pointer needs to be moved to the beginning of the file before reading the lines.

Corrected code:

```python
def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
            self.file.seek(0)  # Move file pointer to the beginning of the file
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```
