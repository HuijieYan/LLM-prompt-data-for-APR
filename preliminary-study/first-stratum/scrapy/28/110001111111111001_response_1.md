The error message indicates that there is an assertion error when attempting to determine if the request 'r1' has been seen by the RFPDupeFilter. This suggests that the request 'r1' is not being properly marked as seen when it should be.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `__init__` method. Specifically, the issue might be related to how the existing fingerprints are being read from the file and added to the set of fingerprints in the `__init__` method.

The bug occurs because when the `__init__` method is called, it attempts to read requests from a file and add them to the set of fingerprints. However, the code to read from the file is not handled correctly, leading to the set of fingerprints not being initialized properly.

To fix this bug, the code for reading requests from the file and adding them to the set of fingerprints should be handled correctly in the `__init__` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
    self.file = None
    self.fingerprints = set()
    self.logdupes = True
    self.debug = debug
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    if path:
        requests_seen_file = os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen')
        if os.path.exists(requests_seen_file):
            with open(requests_seen_file, 'r') as file:
                for line in file:
                    self.fingerprints.add(line.strip())
        self.file = open(requests_seen_file, 'a+')
```

In this corrected code, the existing fingerprints are read from the file correctly and added to the set of fingerprints. This ensures that the set of fingerprints is properly initialized in the `__init__` method.
