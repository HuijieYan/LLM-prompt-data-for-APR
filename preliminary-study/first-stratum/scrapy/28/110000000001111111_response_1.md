The potential error in the given function is that it does not import the necessary modules 'os' and 'logging'. Additionally, the function does not close the file after reading it, which can lead to resource leaks.

To fix the bug, the import statements for 'os' and 'logging' need to be added at the beginning of the function. Also, it's important to close the file after reading it to prevent resource leaks.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import os
import logging

class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
            self.file.close()
```

With these changes, the function should work correctly and ensure that the file is closed after reading it.
