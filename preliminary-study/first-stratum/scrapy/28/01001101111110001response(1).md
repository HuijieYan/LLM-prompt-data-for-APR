The potential error in the provided code is that the `__init__` method is not properly initializing the `fingerprint` set from the file.

The `AssertionError` in the test function `test_dupefilter_path` suggests that the request is not being properly recorded as seen in the `RFPDupeFilter` object.

The bug is likely occurring because the `fingerprint` set is not being properly initialized with the data from the file in the `__init__` method. This is leading to the incorrect behavior and the failing assertions in the test.

To fix this bug, we need to read the file data and initialize the `fingerprint` set properly in the `__init__` method.

Here's the corrected `__init__` method:

```python
import logging
import os

class RFPDupeFilter:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.file_path = os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen')
            if os.path.exists(self.file_path):
                with open(self.file_path, 'r') as file:
                    self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in file.readlines())
```

In the corrected code, we initialize the `self.file_path` using the `os.path.join` function and then check if the file exists. If it does, we open the file and read its content line by line, updating the `self.fingerprints` set. This ensures that the fingerprints are properly initialized from the file.
