The test case is creating two `Request` objects `r1` and `r2` and then creating a temporary directory `path` using `tempfile.mkdtemp()`. It then creates an instance of `RFPDupeFilter` with the `path` as the argument. The test checks if `r1` is seen by the dupe filter, and then if it is seen again after adding it to the dupe filter. It then creates another instance of `RFPDupeFilter` with the same `path` and checks if `r1` and `r2` are seen by the dupe filter.

The error occurs when the test checks if `r1` is seen by the second instance of `RFPDupeFilter` (`df2`). The assertion fails because the second instance is not able to see `r1`, even though it was added to the first instance of `RFPDupeFilter` (`df`).

The potential error location is within the `__init__` method of the `RFPDupeFilter` class, specifically in the logic that initializes the `self.file` and `self.fingerprints` attributes.

The reason for the bug is that when a new instance of `RFPDupeFilter` is created with the same `path`, it opens the same file and reads the fingerprints from it. However, when the file is read, the file pointer is at the end of the file, so it does not read any existing fingerprints from the file.

To fix the bug, the `open()` method should be modified to read the fingerprints from the file before the file pointer in the `__init__` method.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class RFPDupeFilter(BaseDupeFilter):
    """
    Request Fingerprint duplicates filter
    """

    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            file_path = os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen')
            if os.path.exists(file_path):
                with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
                    self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in file)
            self.file = open(file_path, 'a+')
```
