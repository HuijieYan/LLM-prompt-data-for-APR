The potential error in the given code is with the `open()` method. The `open()` method is called within the `__init__` method, which may lead to errors when creating a new instance of the `RFPDupeFilter` class.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `open()` method should not be called within the `__init__` method for proper instantiation. Instead, it should be called explicitly after the instance of the class has been created.

To fix the bug, the `open()` method should be removed from the `__init__` method and called explicitly after creating the instance of the class.

Here is the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
    self.file = None
    self.fingerprints = set()
    self.logdupes = True
    self.debug = debug
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    if path:
        self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
        self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)

# Add an open method to the class
def open(self):
    if self.file:
        self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
        self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)

# Add a close method to the class
def close(self, message):
    if self.file:
        self.file.close()
```

By separating the `open()` and `close()` methods from the `__init__` method, the class is now more compliant with the correct instantiation workflow.
