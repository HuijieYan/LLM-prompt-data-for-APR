Potential error location: The potential error in the given function is the usage of `self.file` without closing it, which could lead to issues with file handling and memory consumption.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the file is not closed after it is opened, which could lead to resource leakage and file corruption.

Suggested approach for fixing the bug: Add a method to close the file after it has been used, to properly handle file resources and avoid leakage.

Corrected code:

```python
import os
import logging

class ClassName:  # Assuming this is part of a class

    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)

    def close_file(self):
        if self.file:
            self.file.close()

# Usage of the close_file method
# obj = ClassName()
# ... (other code)
# obj.close_file()
```
