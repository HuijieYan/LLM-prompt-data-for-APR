Potential error location: The potential error is in the __init__ method, where the "self" parameter is not being recognized properly.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
In Python, when defining a class method, the first parameter is always "self" to refer to the instance of the class. However, in the provided code, __init__ method is missing the "self" parameter, which is causing the error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
The __init__ method should always have "self" as the first parameter to reference the instance of the class. By adding "self" as the first parameter, this bug can be fixed.

Corrected code:
```python
import os
import logging

class ClassName:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```
