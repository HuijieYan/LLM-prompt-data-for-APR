The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `RFPDupeFilter` class. The error message indicates that the `df2.request_seen(r1)` assertion fails, which means that the `request_seen` method is not working correctly and it's likely due to the initialization of the `RFPDupeFilter` instance.

The bug in the `__init__` method is the incorrect usage of `open` and `close` methods, which are not defined in the given code. The initialization of the `file` and `fingerprints` attributes is also problematic as it doesn't handle the file operations properly.

To fix the bug, we need to properly initialize the `file` and `fingerprints` attributes, handle file operations safely, and remove the unneeded code for `open` and `close` methods.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
import os
import logging

class RFPDupeFilter(BaseDupeFilter):
    """
    Request Fingerprint duplicates filter
    """

    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        super().__init__()
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        self.file_path = os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen') if path else None
        self.fingerprints = set()

        if self.file_path and os.path.exists(self.file_path):
            with open(self.file_path, 'r') as file:
                self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in file)

    # Other methods and attributes
```

In the corrected code:
- We properly initialize the `file_path` attribute to store the path of the file.
- We check if the file exists before trying to open and read from it.
- We use a `with` statement to safely open and read from the file.
- We removed the unneeded `open` and `close` method calls.
