The issue seems to be with the `request_seen` method of the `RFPDupeFilter` class. The method is not correctly checking if the request is already seen or not.

The bug occurs because when the `request_seen` method is called, it is not correctly checking the fingerprints set to determine if the request has already been seen. As a result, the test case fails.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `request_seen` method to correctly check if the request has already been seen based on its fingerprint.

Here's the corrected `request_seen` method:

```python
class RFPDupeFilter(BaseDupeFilter):
    """
    Request Fingerprint duplicates filter
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)

    def request_seen(self, request):
        fp = request_fingerprint(request)
        if fp in self.fingerprints:
            return True
        self.fingerprints.add(fp)
        if self.file:
            self.file.write(fp + os.linesep)
        return False
```

With this modification, the `request_seen` method first checks if the fingerprint of the request is in the `fingerprints` set. If it is, the method returns `True` indicating that the request has already been seen. If the fingerprint is not in the set, it adds the fingerprint to the set and writes it to the file if the file is available, then returns `False`.

This should resolve the issue and make the `request_seen` method work as expected.
