The test case `test_dupefilter_path` creates two requests `r1` and `r2`, then creates an instance of `RFPDupeFilter` with a temporary path, and checks if the requests have been seen or not. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df2.request_seen(r1)` failed.

The potential error location is within the `__init__` method of the `RFPDupeFilter` class, specifically in the line `self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)`. This line is intended to initialize the fingerprints set with the contents of the file, but it doesn't properly read the file and update the set.

The bug occurs because the file is not being read correctly and therefore doesn't update the `fingerprints` set with the contents of the file.

To fix the bug, the file should be properly read and updated. One possible approach is to use a `with` statement to ensure proper handling of the file, and iterate through the lines to update the `fingerprints` set.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class RFPDupeFilter(BaseDupeFilter):
    """
    Request Fingerprint duplicates filter
    """

    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            with open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'r') as file:
                self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in file.readlines())
```
