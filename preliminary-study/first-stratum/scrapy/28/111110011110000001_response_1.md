The test function `test_dupefilter_path` is creating two `Request` objects, `r1` and `r2`, and then it's creating a temporary directory using `tempfile.mkdtemp()` and instantiating an object `df` of the class `RFPDupeFilter` with the temporary directory path as an argument. The test checks if the `request_seen` method of `df` returns the expected values for `r1` and `r2`.

The error message shows that the `assert df2.request_seen(r1)` is failing, indicating that the `request_seen` method is not behaving as expected.

The potential error location within the `RFPDupeFilter` class is in the `__init__` method where the file at the specified path is opened and its content is used to update `self.fingerprints`. The issue is likely that the file is not being properly read or updated.

To fix the bug, the `__init__` method should be modified to ensure that the file is correctly read and its content is properly used to update `self.fingerprints`.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
import os
import logging

class RFPDupeFilter(BaseDupeFilter):
    """
    Request Fingerprint duplicates filter
    """

    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file_path = os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen') if path else None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if self.file_path:
            with open(self.file_path, 'a+') as file:
                file.seek(0)
                self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in file.readlines())
```

In the corrected code:
- The file path is stored in the `self.file_path` attribute for later use.
- The file is opened using a `with` statement to ensure it's properly closed after being used.
- The file cursor is moved to the beginning of the file using `file.seek(0)` to ensure that the content is read from the start.
- `file.readlines()` is used to read all lines in the file and `rstrip()` is applied to each line to remove any trailing whitespace before updating `self.fingerprints`.
