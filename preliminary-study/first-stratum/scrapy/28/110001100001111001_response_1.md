The problem with the provided code is that the file is opened in 'a+' mode, which means it will open the file for writing and also create it if it does not exist. The issue with this is that when the file is created, the file pointer is at the end of the file, so when trying to read the fingerprints, it reads nothing since the pointer is already at the end of the file.

To fix this, the file should be opened in 'r' mode to ensure that the file is only read.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import os
import logging

class DupeFilter:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'r')
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```
