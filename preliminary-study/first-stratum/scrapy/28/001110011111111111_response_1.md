The error occurs in the `RFPDupeFilter` class where the `request_seen` method is not correctly checking if a request has been seen before. The bug is likely caused by the incorrect implementation of the `request_seen` method, which is not provided in the given code snippet.

To fix this bug, the `request_seen` method should be implemented to check if the request has been seen before and return a boolean value accordingly. Additionally, the `RFPDupeFilter` class should also include the `open` and `close` methods, which are being called in the test function but not defined in the given code snippet.

Here's the corrected code for the `RFPDupeFilter` class with the `request_seen`, `open`, and `close` methods implemented:

```python
import os
import logging

class RFPDupeFilter(BaseDupeFilter):
    """
    Request Fingerprint duplicates filter
    """

    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)

    def request_seen(self, request):
        fingerprint = request.url # assuming URL is used as the fingerprint
        if fingerprint in self.fingerprints:
            return True
        else:
            self.fingerprints.add(fingerprint)
            if self.file:
                self.file.write(fingerprint + '\n')
            return False

    def open(self):
        # Perform any necessary operations when opening the dupe filter
        pass

    def close(self, reason):
        if self.file:
            self.file.close()
        # Perform any necessary operations when closing the dupe filter
        pass
```

With these changes, the `RFPDupeFilter` class now includes the `request_seen`, `open`, and `close` methods required for proper functionality. The new `request_seen` method checks if a request has been seen before and returns a boolean value accordingly.
