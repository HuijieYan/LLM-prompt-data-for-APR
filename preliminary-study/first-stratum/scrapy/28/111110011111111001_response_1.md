The bug is most likely occurring in the RFPDupeFilter class' __init__ method. 

The reason behind the bug in the __init__ method is that it is not reading the contents of the file properly when it initializes the set of fingerprints. The __init__ method opens the file for appending ('a+'), but it does not read the contents of the file correctly into the fingerprints set.

To fix this bug, the code should be modified to read the contents of the file before appending to the fingerprints set.

Below is the corrected code for the __init__ method:

```python
class RFPDupeFilter(BaseDupeFilter):
    """
    Request Fingerprint duplicates filter
    """

    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
            self.fingerprints.update({x.rstrip() for x in self.file.readlines()})  # Read the contents of the file
```

This modification ensures that the contents of the file are read correctly into the fingerprints set when the RFPDupeFilter object is initialized.

After making this change, the test_dupefilter_path test function should pass without any AssertionError.
