The potential error location within the __init__ function is the way the file is opened and read. The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect use of the 'a+' mode in the file open statement. This mode is causing the file pointer to be placed at the end of the file, where any writes will be appended to the file without being able to read the previously written content.

To fix this bug, the file should be opened in 'r' mode to enable reading while keeping the file open for writing if needed.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import os
import logging

class DupeFilter:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'r')
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```

In the corrected code, the file is opened in 'r' mode to allow reading of previously written content.
