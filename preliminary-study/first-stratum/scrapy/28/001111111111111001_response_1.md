The error occurs in the `test_dupefilter_path` test function, specifically at the line `assert df2.request_seen(r1)`. The `request_seen` method is not behaving as expected.

The potential error in the `__init__` function of the `RFPDupeFilter` class is the logic that reads existing fingerprints from a file. It fails to reset the file pointer to the beginning of the file before reading its contents.

The bug occurs because after opening the file in 'a+' mode, the file pointer is positioned at the end of the file. When trying to read the contents of the file using `self.file`, it does not read anything because the file pointer is already at the end.

To fix this bug, the file pointer should be reset to the beginning of the file immediately after opening the file.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
    self.file = None
    self.fingerprints = set()
    self.logdupes = True
    self.debug = debug
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    if path:
        self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
        self.file.seek(0)  # Reset the file pointer to the beginning of the file
        self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```

By adding `self.file.seek(0)` after opening the file, we ensure that the file pointer is positioned at the beginning, allowing the contents of the file to be read correctly.
