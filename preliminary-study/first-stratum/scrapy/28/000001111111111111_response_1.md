The error occurs in the `test_dupefilter_path` function. The function creates an instance of `RFPDupeFilter`, opens it, performs checks using the `request_seen` method, and then closes it. However, when the second instance of `RFPDupeFilter` is created and checked for `r1`, the test fails because it shouldn't have seen `r1` at that point.

The issue in the `__init__` function of the `RFPDupeFilter` class is that the existing fingerprints are loaded from the file, but they are not added to the set of `fingerprints` when the instance is created. This causes the `request_seen` method to return incorrect results.

To fix this issue, the fingerprints loaded from the file need to be added to the `fingerprints` set in the `__init__` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` function of the `RFPDupeFilter` class:

```python
import os
import logging

class RFPDupeFilter:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
            self.file.seek(0)  # Reset the file pointer to the beginning
```

By adding `self.file.seek(0)` after updating the fingerprints, we ensure that the file pointer is reset to the beginning of the file for subsequent reads.

With this correction, the `request_seen` method will return the expected results, and the test case should pass successfully.
