The bug in the given code is that the `open` method is being used to open a file, but the file is not being closed after it is used. This can lead to resource leaks and potential data loss.

To fix this, we can utilize the `with` statement when opening the file. This ensures that the file is closed after its suite finishes, even if an exception is raised. This will prevent any resource leaks and potential data loss.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
    self.file = None
    self.fingerprints = set()
    self.logdupes = True
    self.debug = debug
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    if path:
        with open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+') as file:
            self.file = file
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```
