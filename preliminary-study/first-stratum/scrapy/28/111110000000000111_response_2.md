Potential Error Location:
The potential error location in the code is the line `self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)`. The issue is that the `self.file` needs to be read before iterating over it to update the fingerprints set.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the file is not read before attempting to iterate over it. As a result, the fingerprints set is not being updated with the contents of the file.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the file needs to be read first and then the fingerprints set should be updated with the contents of the file.

Corrected Code:
```python
def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
    self.file = None
    self.fingerprints = set()
    self.logdupes = True
    self.debug = debug
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    if path:
        self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
        self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file.readlines())
```
