The error occurs in the `test_dupefilter_path` function. Specifically, the issue arises when `df2.request_seen(r1)` is called, which should return `True` but is instead returning `False`. This indicates a problem with the `request_seen` method of the `RFPDupeFilter` class.

The problem lies within the `__init__` method of the `RFPDupeFilter` class. The issue is with the line `self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)`. This line is trying to update the `self.fingerprints` set with the lines of text from `self.file`, but it's doing this before checking whether `self.file` actually contains any data.

To fix this, we need to ensure that `self.file` is read and its contents are parsed properly before updating `self.fingerprints`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import os
import logging

class RFPDupeFilter(BaseDupeFilter):
    """
    Request Fingerprint duplicates filter
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            file_path = os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen')
            if os.path.exists(file_path):
                with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
                    self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in file)
            self.file = open(file_path, 'a+')
```

In the corrected code, we check if the file specified by `path` exists. If it does, we read its contents before updating `self.fingerprints`. This ensures that `self.fingerprints` gets updated with the correct data.
