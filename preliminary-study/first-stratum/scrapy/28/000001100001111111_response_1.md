The issue with the given code is that the `__init__` function is missing the `self` parameter in its declaration, causing it to initialize the variables using the wrong reference. Additionally, the correct import statements for `os` and `logging` are not included in the code.

To fix the code, the `__init__` function should be updated to correctly initialize the variables using the `self` reference and add the necessary import statements.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` function:

```python
import os
import logging

class RFPDupeFilter:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```

In this corrected code:
- The `self` parameter is added to the `__init__` function's declaration, ensuring that the variables are correctly initialized using the instance reference.
- The import statements for `os` and `logging` are included at the beginning of the file.
