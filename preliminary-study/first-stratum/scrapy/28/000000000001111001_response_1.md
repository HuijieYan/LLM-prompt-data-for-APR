The potential error in the provided code is that the `open` method is used to open a file, but it is not being closed after its use. This can lead to resource leaks and potential issues with file handling.

To fix this bug, the `open` method should be used within a `with` statement to ensure that the file is properly closed after its use.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` function:

```python
import logging
import os

class ClassName:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            with open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+') as file:
                self.file = file
                self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```

By using the `with` statement, the file will be automatically closed after its use, preventing any potential resource leaks and issues with file handling.
