The issue seems to be with the `request_seen` method within the `RFPDupeFilter` class. This method is not correctly capturing and comparing the fingerprints of the requests, resulting in an unexpected `AssertionError` in the test case.

The bug seems to be occurring because the `request_seen` method is not correctly checking for duplicate requests using their fingerprints.

To fix the bug, the `request_seen` method should compute the fingerprint for each request and compare it with the fingerprints stored in the `fingerprints` set.

Below is the corrected code for the `request_seen` method within the `RFPDupeFilter` class:

```python
class RFPDupeFilter:

    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)

    def request_seen(self, request):
        fp = request_fingerprint(request)
        if fp in self.fingerprints:
            return True
        self.fingerprints.add(fp)
        if self.file:
            self.file.write(fp + os.linesep)
        return False
```

In the corrected code, the `request_seen` method now computes the fingerprint of the request using the `request_fingerprint` function and then checks if it is already present in the `fingerprints` set. If it is not present, the fingerprint is added to the set and written to the file.

This should fix the bug and prevent the `AssertionError` reported in the test case.
