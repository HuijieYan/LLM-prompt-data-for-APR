Potential error location: The problem is likely in the line "self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)". This line tries to update the set "self.fingerprints" with the contents of the file, but it is missing a loop to iterate over the lines of the file.

Reasons for the bug: The bug occurs because the code is not correctly reading the lines from the file and updating the set with the contents.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: We can fix the bug by adding a loop to iterate over the lines of the file and update the set with each line.

Corrected code:

```python
def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
    self.file = None
    self.fingerprints = set()
    self.logdupes = True
    self.debug = debug
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    if path:
        self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
        for line in self.file:
            self.fingerprints.add(line.rstrip())
```
