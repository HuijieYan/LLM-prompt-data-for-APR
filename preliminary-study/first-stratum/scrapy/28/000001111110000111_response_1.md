The potential error in the `__init__` function is in the `self.fingerprints` initialization. The bug most likely occurs because the function is not properly reading the data from the `requests.seen` file when the `RFPDupeFilter` object is instantiated with a given path.

The corrected code for the `__init__` function is as follows:

```python
import os
import shutil
import logging
import tempfile
from scrapy.http import Request


# Corrected __init__ function
def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
    self.file = None
    self.fingerprints = set()
    self.logdupes = True
    self.debug = debug
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    if path:
        requests_file_path = os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen')
        if os.path.exists(requests_file_path):
            with open(requests_file_path, 'r') as file:
                self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in file)
        self.file = open(requests_file_path, 'a+')
```
