Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the line `self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)`. It is supposed to initialize the set `self.fingerprints` with the contents of the file, but it is not working as expected. This might be due to the fact that the file pointer is at the end of the file, so attempting to read it at this point does not yield the expected result.

Reason for the bug: The bug occurs because the file pointer is at the end of the file, so reading the file directly does not provide the contents as expected.

Possible approach to fix the bug: To fix the bug, we need to seek the file pointer to the beginning of the file before reading its contents. Additionally, we should use a context manager (`with` statement) for handling file operations to ensure that the file is properly closed after its usage.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class RFPDupeFilter(BaseDupeFilter):
    """
    Request Fingerprint duplicates filter
    """
    
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            with open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+') as file:
                file.seek(0)
                self.file = file
                self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```
