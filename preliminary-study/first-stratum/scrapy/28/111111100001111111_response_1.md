Potential error location:
The issue might be in the `self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)` line, where the contents of the file are being read and added to the fingerprints set.

Reason for the occurrence of the bug:
The bug could be caused by not moving the file pointer to the start of the file before reading its contents. As a result, the read operation might be starting from the end of the file, resulting in no content being read.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
Before reading the file contents, the file pointer should be moved to the start of the file. This can be achieved using the seek(0) method on the file object.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
    self.file = None
    self.fingerprints = set()
    self.logdupes = True
    self.debug = debug
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    if path:
        self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
        self.file.seek(0)  # Move the file pointer to the start of the file
        self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```
