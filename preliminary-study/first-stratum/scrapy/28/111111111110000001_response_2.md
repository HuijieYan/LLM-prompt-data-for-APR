Potential Error Location:
The issue is likely with the `__init__` function of the `RFPDupeFilter` class. More specifically, the problem may be related to the `open` and `close` methods, likely due to the `file` not being properly opened and closed.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `__init__` function is not properly opening the file when `path` is provided. Additionally, the `open` and `close` methods are not defined in the original function.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Define the `open` and `close` methods to properly handle opening and closing the file.
2. Update the `__init__` function to handle the opening of the file correctly when `path` is provided.

Corrected Code:
```python
import os
import logging
from scrapy.utils.request import request_fingerprint
from scrapy.dupefilters import BaseDupeFilter

class RFPDupeFilter(BaseDupeFilter):
    """
    Request Fingerprint duplicates filter
    """

    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)

    def request_seen(self, request):
        fp = request_fingerprint(request)
        if fp in self.fingerprints:
            return True
        self.fingerprints.add(fp)
        self.file.write(fp + os.linesep)
        return False

    def close(self, reason):
        if self.file:
            self.file.close()
```
