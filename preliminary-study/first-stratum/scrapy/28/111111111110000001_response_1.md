The error seems to be related to the `request_seen` function of the `RFPDupeFilter` class. The issue might be with how the fingerprints are being stored and accessed. The `request_seen` function is likely not able to check if a request has been seen before.

The bug occurs because the fingerprints are not being properly stored and checked in the `request_seen` function. The fingerprints are read from the file, but they are not stored in the `self.fingerprints` set, so the `request_seen` function is unable to check if a request has been seen before.

To fix the bug, the fingerprints need to be stored in the `self.fingerprints` set within the `__init__` function. This will allow the `request_seen` function to properly check if a request has been seen before.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
    self.file = None
    self.logdupes = True
    self.debug = debug
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    if path:
        self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
        self.fingerprints = set(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
    else:
        self.fingerprints = set()
```

With this correction, the `fingerprints` will be properly stored and accessed in the `request_seen` function, fixing the bug.
