The test case is creating an instance of the `RFPDupeFilter` class with a `path` argument and then calling the `open()` method on the instance. The error message indicates that the `assert df2.request_seen(r1)` failed, which suggests that the `request_seen()` method is not functioning as expected.

The potential error location within the `__init__` function is the way the `self.fingerprints` set is being initialized. The current code initializes `self.fingerprints` as an empty set and then updates it with the contents of the file if the `path` argument is provided. However, the file is opened and read only during the instantiation of the object, so any changes made to the file after the instantiation will not be reflected in the `self.fingerprints` set.

To fix this issue, the file reading logic should be moved from the `__init__` method to the `open()` method, so that it can be read every time the filter is opened, and the `self.fingerprints` set can be updated accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:
```python
def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
    self.file = None
    self.fingerprints = set()
    self.logdupes = True
    self.debug = debug
    self.path = path
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
```

And here's the correct implementation for the `open()` method:
```python
def open(self):
    if self.path:
        if not os.path.exists(os.path.join(self.path, 'requests.seen')):
            with open(os.path.join(self.path, 'requests.seen'), 'w+'):
                pass  # create the file if it doesn't exist
        with open(os.path.join(self.path, 'requests.seen'), 'r') as file:
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in file)
```

With these corrections, the `self.fingerprints` set will be updated with the contents of the file every time the `open()` method is called, ensuring that it reflects the current state of the file. This should resolve the issue encountered in the test case.
