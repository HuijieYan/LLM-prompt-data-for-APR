Potential error location:
The issue seems to be with the `request_seen` method of the `RFPDupeFilter` class. The `request_seen` method is not implemented correctly, which is causing the assertion error in the test.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The `request_seen` method is not checking if the request has been seen before or not based on its fingerprint.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `request_seen` method to calculate the fingerprint of the request and check if it exists in the set of fingerprints.
2. Ensure that the `open` and `close` methods are functioning correctly and updating the set of fingerprints.

Corrected code:
```python
class RFPDupeFilter(BaseDupeFilter):
    """
    Request Fingerprint duplicates filter
    """

    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)

    def request_seen(self, request):
        fp = request_fingerprint(request)
        if fp in self.fingerprints:
            return True
        self.fingerprints.add(fp)
        self.file.write(fp + os.linesep)
        return False
```

In the corrected code, the `request_seen` method has been added to calculate the fingerprint of the request and check if it exists in the set of fingerprints. If it doesn't exist, it adds the fingerprint to the set and writes it to the file.
