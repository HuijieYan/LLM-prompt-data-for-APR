The error seems to be related to the `RFPDupeFilter` class not functioning as expected. The error occurs when the test case asserts that `df2` has seen `r1`, which is not the case.

The potential error location within the function is the opening of the file and updating the `self.fingerprints`. It seems that the file is not being read properly, resulting in incorrect behavior when checking for a seen request.

The reason behind the bug might be that the file is not being properly opened or read, causing the `self.fingerprints` set to not be updated correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the file is properly opened and read to update the `self.fingerprints` set with the fingerprints from the file.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` function:

```python
import os
import logging

class RFPDupeFilter:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            file_path = os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen')
            if os.path.exists(file_path):
                with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
                    self.fingerprints.update(x.strip() for x in file.readlines())
            self.file = open(file_path, 'a+')
```

In the corrected code, we check if the file exists before opening it and read its contents to update the `self.fingerprints` set. This should ensure that the dupe filter behaves as expected and resolves the error in the test case.
