Potential Error Location: The issue seems to be with the file path provided to open for reading the 'requests.seen' file.

Reasons for the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the file path provided may not be accessible or may not exist, which results in the "FileNotFoundError".

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the directory of the provided file path exists, if not, create the directory.
2. Handle the "FileNotFoundError" exception to prevent the function from crashing.
3. Use the 'with' statement to open the file, which automatically handles the closing of the file, improving code readability and reducing the chance of bugs.

Corrected code:
```python
import os

def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
    self.file = None
    self.fingerprints = set()
    self.logdupes = True
    self.debug = debug
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    if path:
        os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen')), exist_ok=True)  # create directory if it doesn't exist
        try:
            with open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+') as file:
                self.file = file
                self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
        except FileNotFoundError:
            # handle the error
            print('File not found error: path does not exist or is not accessible')
```

This corrected code creates the directory if it doesn't exist, and handles the FileNotFoundError exception when opening the file. This prevents the function from crashing and ensures that the file is accessed properly.
