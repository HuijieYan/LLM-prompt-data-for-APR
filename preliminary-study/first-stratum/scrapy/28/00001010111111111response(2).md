The error is likely occurring in the `__init__` method of the `RFPDupeFilter` class. The `__init__` method is supposed to initialize the object's attributes, including `self.file` and `self.fingerprints`, with default values. It also should open the file at the given `path` and update the `fingerprints` attribute.

The buggy code does not handle the `path` parameter properly and does not import the required modules like `os` and `logging`. As a result, the function is not operating as expected, leading to assertion errors in the test case.

To fix the bug:
1. Import the required modules `os` and `logging` at the beginning of the file.
2. Use the path parameter properly to open the file and update the fingerprints attribute.
3. Add appropriate error handling for file operations.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
import os
import logging

class RFPDupeFilter:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        import tempfile
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            try:
                self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
                self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
            except FileNotFoundError:
                pass
```

With these changes, the `__init__` method should handle the `path` parameter properly, open the file, and update the `fingerprints` attribute accordingly, addressing the issues in the original code.
