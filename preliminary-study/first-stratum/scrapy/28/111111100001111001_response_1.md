The bug seems to be occurring in the `__init__` method for the `RFPDupeFilter` class. The bug occurs because after opening the file, the code tries to update the `self.fingerprints` set with the content of the file. However, it is not explicitly closing the file after reading the content. This can cause issues with resource management and could lead to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, the `__init__` method should also close the file after reading its content. This can be done using a `with` statement, which ensures that the file is closed once its block of code is exited.

Here is the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
    self.file = None
    self.fingerprints = set()
    self.logdupes = True
    self.debug = debug
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    if path:
        with open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+') as file:
            self.file = file
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```

With this change, the file will be automatically closed after reading its content, leading to improved resource management and preventing potential issues related to the file not being closed.
