Potential Error Location: The potential error in the buggy code is the `__init__` function. It seems that the `__init__` function is not correctly initializing the variables and opening the file when the `path` parameter is provided.

Reason for the Bug: The bug may be occurring due to the incorrect initialization of the `path` parameter. The `open()` method is not being called, causing the file to not be opened and the fingerprints not being updated.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: 
1. Add a check to ensure that the file is not None before trying to update the fingerprints.
2. Use a try-except block to handle any potential file-related errors that may occur during file opening.
3. Ensure that the file is closed after finishing the operations to avoid any resource leaks.

Corrected Code:

```python
import os
import logging

class RFPDupeFilter:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        
        if path:
            try:
                self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
                self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
            except Exception as e:
                self.logger.error(f"Error opening file: {e}")
            finally:
                if self.file:
                    self.file.close()
```
In this corrected code, a try-except block is used to handle any exceptions that may occur when opening the file. The `self.file` is checked to ensure that it is not None before attempting to update the fingerprints. Additionally, the file is closed in the `finally` block to prevent resource leaks.
