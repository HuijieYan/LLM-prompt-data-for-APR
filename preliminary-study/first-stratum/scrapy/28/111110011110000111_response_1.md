The test case is creating two requests r1 and r2. It then creates a temporary directory, initializes an instance of RFPDupeFilter with the temporary directory path, and performs assertions on whether requests have been seen or not.

The potential error location lies in the RFPDupeFilter class, specifically in the __init__ method. The error is likely caused by the way the code initializes the file and updates the set of fingerprints.

The bug occurs because the code attempts to update the set of fingerprints from the file before the file has been opened. This leads to an empty set of fingerprints, causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the file is opened before attempting to update the set of fingerprints.

Here's the corrected code for the RFPDupeFilter class:

```python
class RFPDupeFilter(BaseDupeFilter):
    """
    Request Fingerprint duplicates filter
    """

    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
            self.file.seek(0)  # move the file pointer to the beginning
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)

    # ... omitted code ...
```

With this correction, the file is opened and the set of fingerprints is updated after the file has been properly initialized. This should fix the issue and make the test case pass.
