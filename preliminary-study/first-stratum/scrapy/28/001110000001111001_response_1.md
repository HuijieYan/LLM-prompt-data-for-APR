The bug in the given function is that it is reading data from a file and updating the set of fingerprints, but not resetting the file pointer to the beginning of the file after reading. This causes subsequent reads to return no data, resulting in an empty set of fingerprints.

To fix this bug, we need to reset the file pointer to the beginning of the file after reading it. This can be achieved by using the `seek(0)` method on the file object.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method of the `RFPDupeFilter` class:

```python
def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
    self.file = None
    self.fingerprints = set()
    self.logdupes = True
    self.debug = debug
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

    if path:
        self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
        self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
        self.file.seek(0) # Reset file pointer to the beginning of the file
```

By adding `self.file.seek(0)` after reading the file, we ensure that the file pointer is reset to the beginning, allowing subsequent reads to work correctly.
