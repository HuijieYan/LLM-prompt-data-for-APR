The bug in the given code is that the function does not properly read the existing requests.seen file and update the fingerprints set with the contents of that file.

The potential error in the code is the incorrect initialization of the fingerprints set with the contents of the requests.seen file. The code is not correctly reading the file and updating the fingerprints set with the contents.

The bug occurs because the code is not reading the existing requests.seen file correctly to update the fingerprints set. As a result, the set remains empty, and the function does not handle existing fingerprints appropriately.

To fix the bug, we need to properly read the existing requests.seen file and update the fingerprints set with its contents. This can be achieved by opening the file using the 'r' mode instead of 'a+' mode, and then reading its contents to update the fingerprints set.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
    self.file = None
    self.fingerprints = set()
    self.logdupes = True
    self.debug = debug
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    if path:
        try:
            with open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'r') as file:
                self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in file)
        except FileNotFoundError:
            pass
```

In the corrected code, we open the file in 'r' mode and use a try-except block to handle the case where the requests.seen file does not exist. We then update the fingerprints set with the contents of the file using a set comprehension.
