The potential error in the `__init__` function is that it is not reading the contents of the file properly. It should read the content of the file when it is opened and update the set of fingerprints with the file contents.

The bug occurs because the code is not reading the lines from the file correctly and updating the set of fingerprints with the file content.

To fix this bug, the code should read the content of the file and update the fingerprints set with the file content.

```python
import os
import logging

class RFPDupeFilter(BaseDupeFilter):
    """
    Request Fingerprint duplicates filter
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            file_path = os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen')
            if os.path.exists(file_path):
                with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
                    self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in file)
                self.file = open(file_path, 'a+')
            else:
                self.file = open(file_path, 'w')
```
