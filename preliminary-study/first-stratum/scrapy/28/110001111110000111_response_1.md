The error message indicates that the test case is failing at the assertion `assert df2.request_seen(r1)`. This means that the `request_seen` method is not working as expected in the `RFPDupeFilter` class.

The potential error location is within the `__init__` method of the `RFPDupeFilter` class. The bug is likely caused by the way the `file` is opened and read in the `__init__` method.

The bug occurs because the `file` is not being closed after it is opened and read in the `__init__` method. This can lead to unexpected behavior when the file is opened again in a new instance of the class.

To fix the bug, the `file` should be closed after it is opened and read. Additionally, proper error handling should be implemented when working with files.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
import os
import logging

class RFPDupeFilter:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            try:
                self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
                self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
                self.file.close()  # close the file after reading
            except Exception as e:
                self.logger.error(f"Error opening file: {e}")
```

By closing the file after reading and implementing error handling, the bug should be fixed.
