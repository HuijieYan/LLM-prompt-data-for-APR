Potential error location: The potential error is likely to be in the usage of undefined functions `urlparse_cached` and `to_bytes`, as they are not imported or defined in the given code.

Reasons behind the bug: The `urlparse_cached` and `to_bytes` functions are not defined within the provided code, which will result in a NameError when the function is called.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Import the necessary functions (e.g., `urlparse_cached`) from their respective libraries.
2. Define the `to_bytes` function if it is custom and not already defined.

Corrected code:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    """
    Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """

    parsed = urlparse(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = bytes(request.method, 'utf-8') + b" " + bytes(path, 'utf-8') + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + bytes(parsed.hostname, 'utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += bytes(request.headers.to_string(), 'utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected code:
- `urlparse` and `urlunparse` are used from the `urllib.parse` module.
- The `to_bytes` function is replaced with the built-in `bytes` function to encode the strings to bytes.
- The comment is also updated to provide more accurate information about the purpose of the function.
