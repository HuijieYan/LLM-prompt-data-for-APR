Potential Error Location:
The error is occurring in the line `s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"` in the `request_httprepr` function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug is occurring because `parsed.hostname` is returning `None`, and the `to_bytes` function does not handle `None` values properly.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
We can fix the bug by adding a conditional check to handle the case when `parsed.hostname` is `None` before attempting to convert it to bytes.

Corrected Code:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """
    Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """

    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
