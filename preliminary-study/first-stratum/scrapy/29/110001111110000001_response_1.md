The error message indicates that the function `to_bytes` is receiving a `NoneType` instead of the expected `unicode`, `str`, or `bytes` object. This occurs at line 82 in the `request_httprepr` function, specifically when trying to concatenate `parsed.hostname` with bytes.

The bug appears to be caused by the `parsed.hostname` being `None` when the input URL doesn't contain a host component, such as when using the file or ftp scheme.

To fix the bug, the code can be modified to check if `parsed.hostname` is `None` and handle it accordingly.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """
    Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """

    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    host = to_bytes(parsed.hostname) if parsed.hostname is not None else b''
    
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + host + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    
    return s
``` 

This code includes a check for `parsed.hostname` being `None`, and if so, sets the `host` variable to an empty bytes string. This should prevent the `NoneType` error from occurring.
