Potential error location: The error occurs when the `to_bytes` function is called on `parsed.hostname`, which is returning a `NoneType` value.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug is occurring because the `parsed.hostname` is returning `None`, and the `to_bytes` function is unable to handle `NoneType` values.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
We can fix this bug by checking if `parsed.hostname` is `None` before calling the `to_bytes` function. If it's `None`, we can use a default hostname value or raise an error as necessary.

Corrected code:

```python
from six.moves.urllib.parse import urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    """
    Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """

    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    else:
        # Handle the case when parsed.hostname is None
        # For example, set a default hostname or raise an error
        raise ValueError("Hostname is missing in the request URL")

    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
