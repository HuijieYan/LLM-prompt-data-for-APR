The potential error in the provided function is that the `urlparse_cached` and `urlunparse` functions are not defined, but are used in the function. This will result in a NameError when the function is called.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the `urlparse_cached` and `urlunparse` functions are not imported or defined in the function scope.

To fix the bug, the `urlparse_cached` and `urlunparse` functions need to be imported from the `urllib.parse` module. Additionally, the `to_bytes` function is being used, but it's not defined in the provided code. This function should also be defined.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse
import urllib.parse

def request_httprepr(request):
    """
    Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urllib.parse.urlparse(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = request.method.encode('utf-8') + b" " + path.encode('utf-8') + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + parsed.hostname.encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string().encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected code:
- `urlparse` is used to parse the request URL.
- `urlunparse` is used to construct the new URL from the parsed components.
- `to_bytes` function has been replaced with `encode('utf-8')` for the string values.
