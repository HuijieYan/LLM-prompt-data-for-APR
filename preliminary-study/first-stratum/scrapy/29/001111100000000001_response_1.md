Potential Error Location: 
The potential error is in the line `s += request.body`. If `request.body` is not in bytes format, this line will cause an error because it is trying to concatenate bytes with a non-bytes object.

Reasons for the Bug:
The function is assuming that `request.body` is already in bytes format, which may not always be the case. If `request.body` is a string or another data type, the function will throw an error when trying to concatenate it with bytes.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
We can fix this bug by encoding `request.body` to bytes before concatenating it with other bytes objects. This will ensure that all the concatenated elements are of the same type (bytes).

Corrected Code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_29/scrapy/utils/request.py

# corrected function
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += to_bytes(request.body)  # fixed by encoding request.body to bytes
    return s
```
