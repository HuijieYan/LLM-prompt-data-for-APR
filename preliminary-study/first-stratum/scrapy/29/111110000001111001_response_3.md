Potential Error Location: The error lies in the line `s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"`. 

Reason for the Bug: The bug occurs because `parsed.hostname` is expected to contain the hostname, but as seen from the second test case, it is not present in all types of requests (e.g., in case of file protocol). This leads to a TypeError when trying to concatenate bytes with a NoneType.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: We need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is empty or None by providing a default value for the host.

Updated Code:
```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse as urlparse_cached, urlunparse
from twisted.web._responses import to_bytes
from twisted.web.http_headers import Headers

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
