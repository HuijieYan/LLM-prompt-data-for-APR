The potential error in the provided function is the 'urlparse_cached' function, which is not defined within the scope of the given code.

The 'urlparse_cached' function is called in the provided code but it is not defined within the code. This is why the code is not functioning correctly. 

To fix this bug, the 'urlparse_cached' function needs to be imported from the appropriate module. Also, the function 'to_bytes' is being used, but it is not defined in the provided code. It should either be imported from a module that defines it, or it should be defined within the function.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from scrapy.utils.url import urlparse_cached, to_bytes
from scrapy.http import Headers
from six.moves.urllib.parse import urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    """
    Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """

    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
