The error occurs when the `to_bytes` function is passed a `None` value for `text`, causing a `TypeError` to be raised.

The potential error location is inside the `request_httprepr` function, specifically in the line `s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"`. It seems like `parsed.hostname` might be `None`, causing the `to_bytes` function to raise a `TypeError`.

The bug is occurring because the `parsed.hostname` is not being checked for existence or validity before being used in the `to_bytes` function call. It is assumed that `parsed.hostname` will always have a valid value, which is not the case in all scenarios.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `parsed.hostname` is not `None` before using it with the `to_bytes` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname is not None:  # Check if parsed.hostname is not None before using
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

This modification ensures that `parsed.hostname` is not `None` before trying to convert it to bytes, which should resolve the `TypeError` issue.
