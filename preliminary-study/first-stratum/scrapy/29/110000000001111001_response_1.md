The potential error in the code lies in the use of `urlparse_cached` and `urlunparse` functions which are not defined in the code and could potentially cause syntax errors. In addition, there are some variables used in the code that are not initialized or defined, such as `parsed`, `path`, and `s`.

The error occurs due to the use of undefined functions and uninitialized variables, which leads to a syntax error.

To fix the bug, we need to import the required functions `urlparse_cached` and `urlunparse` from the appropriate library, and initialize the variables `parsed`, `path`, and `s`.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
from twisted.web.client import urlparse_cached, urlunparse
from twisted.python.compat import to_bytes

def request_httprepr(request):
    """
    Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    
    # Using urlparse_cached and urlunparse from the appropriate library
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
