The error message indicates that the function `to_bytes()` is receiving a `NoneType` object, which it does not handle. This is likely happening when trying to convert the `parsed.hostname` to bytes. 

The bug is occurring because the `parsed.hostname` is `None`, which the `to_bytes()` function cannot handle. This is likely because the URL being passed to the `request_httprepr` function does not have a hostname, such as `file:///tmp/foo.txt` or `ftp://localhost/tmp/foo.txt`.

To fix the bug, we can modify the code to check if `parsed.hostname` is `None` and handle that scenario before trying to convert it to bytes.

```python
from six.moves.urllib.parse import urlparse as urlparse_cached, urlunparse, urlunsplit
from scrapy.http.request import Request

def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

The code has been modified to check `if parsed.hostname:` before trying to convert it to bytes. This will ensure that we don't encounter a `NoneType` error when attempting to convert it.
