The error message indicates a `TypeError` in the `to_bytes` function, specifically in the line `s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"`. This suggests that the `parsed.hostname` might be of type `NoneType` instead of a string, causing the `to_bytes` function to raise the error.

The reason behind the bug is that the `parsed.hostname` is not being properly handled when the URL does not have a hostname (e.g., for file or FTP URLs). This is causing the `parsed.hostname` to be `None`, leading to the `TypeError` when trying to convert it to bytes.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` might be `None` and provide a default value for it. Another approach is to modify the logic to handle non-HTTP requests differently, as the current logic is specific to HTTP requests.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes
from twisted.web.http import urlparse_cached, urlunparse
from twisted.web.client import Request

def request_httprepr(request):
    """
    Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """

    # Check if it's an HTTP request
    if request.scheme not in ['http', 'https']:
        raise ValueError("Only HTTP/HTTPS requests are supported")

    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname or '') + b"\r\n"  # Provide a default value for hostname if None
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
``` 

In the corrected code, I added a check to ensure that the input is an HTTP/HTTPS request. I also provided a default value for `parsed.hostname` in case it's `None`. These changes should prevent the `TypeError` and handle non-HTTP URLs appropriately.
