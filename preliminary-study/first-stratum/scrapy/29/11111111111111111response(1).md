The error occurs in the `request_httprepr` function at the line `s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"` where the `to_bytes` function is used to convert `parsed.hostname` to bytes. The error message indicates that `parsed.hostname` is of type `NoneType`, leading to a `TypeError` when attempting to convert it to bytes.

The reason for the bug is most likely due to the input request being a non-HTTP request (in this case, a file or FTP request). Non-HTTP requests do not have a hostname, which causes `parsed.hostname` to be `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to handle non-HTTP requests gracefully. We can modify the code to check if the request is a non-HTTP request, and if so, handle it differently to avoid the `NoneType` error. We can also update the function to correctly handle non-HTTP requests by adjusting the logic based on the type of request.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"

    if parsed.scheme == 'http' or parsed.scheme == 'https':
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this corrected code, we first check if the request is an HTTP or HTTPS request before including the "Host" header. This change ensures that non-HTTP requests such as file or FTP requests are handled gracefully and do not cause a `NoneType` error.
