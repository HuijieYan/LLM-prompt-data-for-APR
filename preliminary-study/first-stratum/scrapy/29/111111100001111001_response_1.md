The potential error in the provided function is that the `urlparse_cached` and `urlunparse` functions are not imported and used to parse the URL. This leads to incomplete or incorrect values for `path` and `parsed.hostname`.

To fix this bug, we need to import and use the `urlparse` function from the `urllib.parse` module to properly parse the URL and retrieve the required components.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    """
    Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '') + parsed[2:5] + ('',))
    s = request.method.encode('utf-8') + b" " + path.encode('utf-8') + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + parsed.hostname.encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected code:
- We import the `urlparse` and `urlunparse` functions from the `urllib.parse` module.
- We use `urlparse` to parse the URL and retrieve the required components such as `path` and `hostname`.
- We encode the string components to bytes before concatenating them with other bytes.
- We use the correct indices to access the `path` and `hostname` components from the parsed URL.

These changes should effectively fix the bug in the `request_httprepr` function.
