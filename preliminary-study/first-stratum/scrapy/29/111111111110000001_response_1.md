Potential error location: The error occurs on line 82 of the `request_httprepr` function, where the `to_bytes` function is being used to convert `parsed.hostname` to bytes.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug is occurring because `parsed.hostname` is `None`, and the `to_bytes` function does not handle this case and raises a `TypeError`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Check if `parsed.hostname` is `None` before attempting to convert it to bytes.
- If `parsed.hostname` is `None`, provide a default value for the host.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """
    Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
