The error message indicates that the `to_bytes` function called with `parsed.hostname` returns a `NoneType` instead of the expected `str`, `unicode`, or `bytes` object. This likely means that the `parsed.hostname` is `None`, causing the `to_bytes` function to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` and provide a default value or handle it gracefully in the `request_httprepr` function.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from six import string_types
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes
from scrapy.http.request import Request
from scrapy.utils.url import urlparse_cached, urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    if parsed.hostname is not None:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In this corrected code, we added a check for `parsed.hostname` to see if it's not `None` before trying to use it with `to_bytes`. If it is `None`, it won't be used in the HTTP representation. This should prevent the `NoneType` error from occurring.

With this modification, the `request_httprepr` function should now handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None`, and the test case should pass without any errors.
