Potential error location: 
The bug might be caused by the `request.body` not being encoded properly before being added to the raw HTTP representation.

Reason for the bug:
The bug occurs because the `request.body` is not being properly encoded to bytes before being appended to the raw HTTP representation. If the `request.body` contains non-ASCII characters or special characters, this can lead to an error.

Approach to fixing the bug:
We can fix the bug by encoding `request.body` to bytes before appending it to the raw HTTP representation.

Corrected code:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes

def request_httprepr(request):
    """
    Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """

    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    if request.body:
        s += to_bytes(request.body)
    return s
```
