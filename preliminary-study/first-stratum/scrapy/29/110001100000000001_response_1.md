The potential error in the code is that the function is trying to use `urlparse_cached` and `to_bytes` without importing them. This will cause a NameError when the function is called.

To fix the bug, we need to import `urlparse_cached` and `to_bytes` from the appropriate modules.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from scrapy.utils.python import urlparse_cached, to_bytes
from scrapy.http import Headers

def request_httprepr(request):
    """
    Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """

    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += Headers(request.headers).to_bytes() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
