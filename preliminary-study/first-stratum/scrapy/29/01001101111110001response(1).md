The error message "TypeError: to_bytes must receive a unicode, str or bytes object, got NoneType" indicates that the `to_bytes` function is receiving a `NoneType` object instead of the expected `unicode`, `str`, or `bytes` object.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the `to_bytes` function being called with a NoneType object.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `parsed.path` might be None, and when trying to concatenate with the other strings in the line `path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))`, it's resulting in a NoneType being passed to `to_bytes`.

To fix the bug, we can check if `parsed.path` is None before using it to construct the `path`. If it's None, we can provide a default value, such as an empty string.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from six import ensure_binary

def request_httprepr(request):
    """
    Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = ensure_binary(request.method) + b" " + ensure_binary(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + ensure_binary(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += ensure_binary(request.headers.to_string()) + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected code, we have used the `ensure_binary` function from the `six` module to ensure that the values passed to `to_bytes` are either `unicode`, `str`, or `bytes` objects, thereby preventing the TypeError mentioned in the error message. Additionally, we have used the `parsed.path or '/'` to provide a default value in case `parsed.path` is None.
