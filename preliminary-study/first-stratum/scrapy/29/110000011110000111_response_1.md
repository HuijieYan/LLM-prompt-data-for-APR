The error occurs because the `parsed` variable in the `request_httprepr` function is potentially None, which causes the `to_bytes(parsed.hostname)` to raise a `TypeError` when `parsed.hostname` is None.

To fix this bug:
1. Check if `parsed` is None and handle this case appropriately.
2. Ensure that the function `to_bytes()` receives a valid argument.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes
from scrapy.http.request import urlparse_cached, Request, urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    """
    Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """

    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    if parsed:
        path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
        s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
        if request.headers:
            s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
        s += b"\r\n"
        s += request.body
        return s
    else:
        return b""
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to ensure `parsed` is not None before processing its attributes. If `parsed` is None, the function returns an empty bytes object. This ensures that the `to_bytes(parsed.hostname)` line is only executed when `parsed` is not None, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring.
