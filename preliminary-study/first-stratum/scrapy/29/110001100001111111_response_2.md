The buggy function `request_httprepr` is supposed to return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request. However, it has several issues:

1. The `urlparse_cached` function is used, but it is not defined in the provided code, so it will result in an error.
2. The `urlunparse` function is also used without being defined, leading to another error.
3. The function tries to concatenate `raw.request.method`, `path`, `parsed.hostname`, `request.headers.to_string()`, and `request.body` to generate the raw HTTP representation. There is a potential issue with generating a valid HTTP request string.

To fix this function, we should:
- Use the `urllib.parse` module to parse and construct the URL.
- Ensure that the HTTP request string is generated correctly and consistently.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request."""
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = parsed.path or '/'
    s = f"{request.method} {path} HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += f"Host: {parsed.hostname}\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        for key, value in request.headers.items():
            s += f"{key}: {value}\r\n"
    s += "\r\n"
    s = s.encode('utf-8') + (request.body if request.body else b'')
    return s
```

In this corrected function:
- We use `urlparse` to parse the request URL.
- We construct the HTTP request string using the request method, path, hostname, headers, and body. This ensures that the generated string is a valid HTTP request.
