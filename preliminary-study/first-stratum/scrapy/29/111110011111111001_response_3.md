Potential Error Location:
The error occurs when trying to concatenate the "Host" string with the parsed hostname. It seems like the parsed hostname is returning a NoneType, which causes the error when trying to convert it to bytes.

Reasons for the Occurrence of the Bug:
The bug is occurring because the parsed URL does not contain a hostname when using the "file" scheme. The parsed URL for the "file" scheme only contains the path but not the hostname, so it returns None for the hostname. The code does not handle this case, leading to the TypeError.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the hostname is None before trying to concatenate it in the "Host" string.
2. If the hostname is None, default to an empty string while concatenating.
3. Validate the URL scheme and handle different schemes (e.g., "file", "ftp") appropriately.

Corrected Code:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected code, the "Host" line is only added if the parsed URL contains a hostname. This prevents the TypeError when the hostname is None. Additionally, the code uses the "urlparse" function from the "urllib.parse" module instead of the undefined "urlparse_cached" function.
