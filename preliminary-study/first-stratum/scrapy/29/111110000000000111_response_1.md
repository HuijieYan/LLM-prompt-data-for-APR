Potential error location: The error may be occurring in the concatenation of the strings and bytes when constructing the raw HTTP representation.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug may be occurring due to improper handling of string and byte concatenation in the function.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: We can ensure that all strings are properly converted to bytes using the `encode` method, and then concatenated with other bytes.

Corrected code:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = request.method.encode('utf-8') + b" " + path.encode('utf-8') + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + parsed.hostname.encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string().encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
