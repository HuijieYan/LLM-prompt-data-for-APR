The potential error in the provided function is with the generation of the HTTP representation. The issue is that when the parsed URL does not contain a hostname, the 'Host' header in the HTTP representation is left empty, which is incorrect. This can also be seen in the test cases where the hostname is not included in the 'Host' header.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to include the 'Host' header only if the parsed URL contains a hostname. If the hostname is not present, we can omit the 'Host' header.

Below is the corrected code for the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected code, the 'Host' header is only included if the parsed URL contains a hostname. This ensures that the 'Host' header is correctly represented in the HTTP request.
