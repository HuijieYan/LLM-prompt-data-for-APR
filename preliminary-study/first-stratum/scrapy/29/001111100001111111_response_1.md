The potential error in the provided function is at the following line:

```python
path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
```

The bug occurs because `urlunparse` is being used with incorrect parameters. It seems like the intention is to remove the scheme and netloc from the parsed URL and keep only the path, params, and query. However, the current implementation is not achieving that.

To fix the bug, we should use the `urlparse` function to get the necessary components of the URL and then construct the path using the `path`, `params`, and `query` components.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path, parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = request.method.encode('utf-8') + b" " + path.encode('utf-8') + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + parsed.hostname.encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected code, we use `urlparse` to parse the URL and then extract the `path`, `params`, `query`, and `hostname` components for constructing the HTTP representation.

This should fix the issue and provide the expected behavior for the `request_httprepr` function.
