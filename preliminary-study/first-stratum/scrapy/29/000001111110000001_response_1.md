The error message indicates that the `to_bytes` function is receiving a `NoneType` object, which is causing a `TypeError`. This suggests that the `parsed.hostname` is returning `None`, which is then being passed to the `to_bytes` function.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"`, where `parsed.hostname` is expected to contain the hostname but is actually `None`, causing the error when `to_bytes` is called on it.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `parsed.hostname` may not be present in the URL, causing it to default to `None`. When `to_bytes` is called with `None`, it raises a `TypeError` as it expects a string or bytes object.

To fix the bug, we need to provide a default hostname in case `parsed.hostname` is `None`. This can be achieved using an `or` statement to provide a default value.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from six.moves.urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname or 'localhost') + b"\r\n"  # Provide a default hostname if parsed.hostname is None
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
