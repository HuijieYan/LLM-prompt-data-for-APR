The potential error in the buggy function arises from the use of the `urlparse_cached` and `urlunparse` functions that are not present in the provided code. These functions are likely intended to parse the request URL, extract the path and hostname, and then reconstruct a properly formatted HTTP request.

The bug occurs because the `urlparse_cached` and `urlunparse` functions are missing, which prevents the code from correctly assembling the HTTP request. Additionally, there is an issue with the `to_bytes` function, which is used to convert strings to bytes before concatenation. 

To fix the bug, the missing `urlparse_cached` and `urlunparse` functions need to be implemented or imported from the appropriate module (e.g., `urllib.parse`). Additionally, the `to_bytes` function should be corrected to handle string-to-bytes conversion properly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = request.method.encode('utf-8') + b" " + path.encode('utf-8') + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + parsed.hostname.encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        for key, value in request.headers.items():
            s += key.encode('utf-8') + b": " + value.encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected code, `urlparse` and `urlunparse` are used from `urllib.parse` to properly parse and construct the URL. The `to_bytes` function is replaced with the `encode` method to convert strings to bytes. Additionally, the HTTP headers are now properly concatenated in the `s` variable.
