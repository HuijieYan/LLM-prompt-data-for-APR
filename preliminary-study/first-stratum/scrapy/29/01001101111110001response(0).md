The error is occurring in the `request_httprepr` function due to the usage of the `to_bytes` function with a `NoneType` object. This suggests that the `parsed.hostname` is possibly `None` and causing the `to_bytes` function to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` and convert it to an empty string before using it with `to_bytes`.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse as urlparse_cached, urlunparse
from twisted.web.http_headers import Headers
from twisted.web.client import Request
from twisted.python.compat import to_bytes

def request_httprepr(request):
    """
    Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """

    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname or '') + b"\r\n"  # Handle NoneType for parsed.hostname
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this correction, the `parsed.hostname` being `None` will be handled by converting it to an empty string before using it with `to_bytes`. This should prevent the `TypeError` from occurring and resolve the issue.
