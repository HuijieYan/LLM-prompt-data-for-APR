Potential Error Location:
The error could potentially be in the line `s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"`. This line is trying to concatenate the `hostname` attribute of the `parsed` object with `b"Host: "` and `b"\r\n"`. However, if the `parsed` object does not have a `hostname` attribute, this line could potentially throw an error.

Reasons behind Bug:
The bug occurs because the `parsed` object does not have a `hostname` attribute, and the function is trying to concatenate it with the bytes `b"Host: "` and `b"\r\n"`. This will cause the code to break when `parsed` does not have a `hostname` attribute.

Possible Approaches:
One possible approach to fix this bug is to check if the `parsed` object has a `hostname` attribute before trying to use it. If it does not have a `hostname` attribute, then a default value or an empty string can be used instead.

Corrected Code:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if hasattr(parsed, 'hostname') and parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
