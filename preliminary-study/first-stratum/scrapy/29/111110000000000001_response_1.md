Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the `urlparse_cached` and `urlunparse` functions, as well as the `to_bytes` function. These are not built-in Python functions and need to be imported from the `urllib.parse` module.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The error is likely occurring because the required functions are not imported from the `urllib.parse` module, leading to a NameError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: We need to import the necessary functions from `urllib.parse`. Additionally, we need to make sure the `request` object has the necessary attributes for the code to function properly.

Corrected code:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse
import urllib.parse from urlparse as urlparse_cached

def request_httprepr(request):
    """
    Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """

    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
