The error message indicates that the function `to_bytes` is being called with a `NoneType` argument, which is causing a `TypeError` to be raised. This suggests that the `parsed.hostname` variable is `None`, and that is being passed to `to_bytes`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line:
```python
s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `parsed.hostname` is `None`, and the function `to_bytes` does not handle `None` values appropriately.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` by providing a default value for it.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes
from scrapy.http.request.common import urlparse_cached, urlunparse
from scrapy.http.request import Request

def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname or '') + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected code, the line `s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"` has been modified to `s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname or '') + b"\r\n"`. This change ensures that even if the `parsed.hostname` is `None`, it will be replaced with an empty string before passing it to `to_bytes`.
