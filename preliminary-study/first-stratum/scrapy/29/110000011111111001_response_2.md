The error occurs because the `parsed.hostname` value is `None` in the case of the `file:///tmp/foo.txt` URL, which causes the `to_bytes()` function to fail as it expects a valid string.

The bug is located in the line `s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"`. This line is trying to concatenate `b"Host: "` with the result of the `to_bytes(parsed.hostname)` function, which is causing the error because `parsed.hostname` is `None` and the `to_bytes()` function doesn't handle `None` values.

To fix the bug, we can add a condition to handle the case when `parsed.hostname` is `None` before concatenating it with the other strings. We can set the `parsed.hostname` to an empty string if it is `None`, so the `to_bytes()` function can safely process it.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from six import string_types
from urllib.parse import urlparse as urlparse_cached, urlunparse

def to_bytes(text, encoding=None, errors='strict'):
    """Return the binary representation of `text`. If `text`
    is already a bytes object, return it as-is."""
    if isinstance(text, bytes):
        return text
    if not isinstance(text, string_types):
        raise TypeError('to_bytes must receive a unicode, str or bytes '
                        'object, got %s' % type(text).__name__)
    if text is None:
        return b''
    if isinstance(text, str):
        return text.encode(encoding, errors)
    return bytes(text)

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    host = parsed.hostname if parsed.hostname else ''
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(host) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
