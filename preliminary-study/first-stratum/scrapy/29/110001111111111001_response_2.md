The test case `test_request_httprepr_for_non_http_request` is calling the `request_httprepr` function with a `Request` object having a non-HTTP URL (e.g., `file://` and `ftp://` URLs). This triggers the bug in the `request_httprepr` function.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line where the program tries to concatenate the hostname with the string `Host: `. It seems that the `parsed.hostname` is None, which is causing the `to_bytes()` function to raise a `TypeError`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that for non-HTTP URLs, the `parsed.hostname` might be None, resulting in the `to_bytes()` function receiving a `None` instead of a valid string or bytes object.

To fix the bug, we can modify the code to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is None. We can use a default value for `parsed.hostname` in case it is None, or we can skip the `Host` header when `parsed.hostname` is None.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"

    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected code, we have added a condition to check if `parsed.hostname` is not None before adding the `Host` header to the request representation. If `parsed.hostname` is None, the `Host` header will not be added to the request representation.
