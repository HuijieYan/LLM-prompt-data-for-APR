Potential error location: The potential error is in the `urlparse_cached` function, which is being used but not defined in the code.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `urlparse_cached` function is used to parse the request URL, but it has not been defined within the provided function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: One possible approach is to import the `urlparse_cached` function from the appropriate module or library, such as `urllib.parse`. If the `urlparse_cached` function is a custom function, it needs to be defined and included in the code.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    """
    Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = request.method.encode('utf-8') + b" " + path.encode('utf-8') + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + parsed.hostname.encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string().encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
