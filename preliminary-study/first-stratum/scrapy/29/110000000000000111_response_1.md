The potential error in the given function is that the `urlparse_cached` and `urlunparse` functions are not defined within the scope of the provided code. This will result in a 'NameError' when trying to execute the function.

To fix this, you can import the required functions from the `urllib.parse` module. Additionally, the `to_bytes` function also needs to be defined correctly. Assuming it's a custom function for converting a string to bytes, it needs to be defined as well.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse
import requests

def to_bytes(s):
    # Assuming to_bytes is a custom function for converting a string to bytes
    return bytes(s, 'utf-8')

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected code, the necessary functions are imported from the `urllib.parse` module, and the `to_bytes` function is defined to convert the string to bytes. Additionally, the `urlparse_cached` function is replaced with `urlparse` for parsing the URL.
