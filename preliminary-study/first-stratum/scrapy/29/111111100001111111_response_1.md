The buggy function `request_httprepr` takes a `request` object and returns the raw HTTP representation of the request as bytes. 

The potential error in this function might be related to the `urlparse_cached` and `urlunparse` functions, as well as the usage of `to_bytes` and the concatenation of `bytes` and strings.

The bug occurs because the `urlparse_cached` and `urlunparse` functions are not provided in the code snippet, so it's not clear how they are handling the URL parsing. Additionally, the `to_bytes` function is not defined either. 

To fix this bug, you would need to ensure that the `urlparse_cached` and `urlunparse` functions are correctly parsing and reconstructing the URL, and the `to_bytes` function is correctly converting the input to bytes.

Additionally, you can use `f-strings` or `format` method to concatenate strings with bytes. This will ensure that the concatenated output is of type `bytes`.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse
from scrapy.http import Request

def request_httprepr(request: Request) -> bytes:
    """
    Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """

    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '') + parsed[2:])
    s = f"{request.method} {path} HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += f"Host: {parsed.hostname}\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In this corrected code:
- We are using the `urlparse` function directly to parse the URL.
- We are using an f-string to concatenate strings with the bytes, ensuring that the output is of type `bytes`.
