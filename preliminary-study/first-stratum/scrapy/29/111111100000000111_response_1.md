The potential error in the function is the use of undefined functions like `urlparse_cached`, `urlunparse`, `to_bytes`, and `request.headers.to_string()`. These functions are not defined in the given code and are causing the function to produce errors.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is the use of undefined functions and improper handling of the request data and headers.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Define the missing functions or import them from the appropriate libraries.
2. Properly handle the request data and headers to ensure the correct representation of the HTTP request.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse
from twisted.python.compat import to_bytes

def request_httprepr(request):
    """
    Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """

    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers is not None:
        headers_str = '\r\n'.join(['{}:{}'.format(k,v) for k,v in request.headers.items()])
        s += to_bytes(headers_str) + b"\r\n"
    
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
