Potential error location:
The error is occurring in the line `s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"` inside the `request_httprepr` function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The error message indicates that the `parsed.hostname` is of type `NoneType`, which means that the `parsed` object does not have a `hostname` attribute. This is causing the `to_bytes` function to fail as it is expecting a string, but receiving `NoneType`.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
We need to handle the case where the `parsed` object does not have a `hostname` attribute by checking if it exists before trying to use it.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
from six.moves.urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
