The issue seems to be occurring on the line `s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"` in the `request_httprepr` function. The error message indicates that the `parsed.hostname` is of type `NoneType`, which causes the `to_bytes` function to raise a TypeError.

The reason behind the bug is that `parsed.hostname` is `None`, which means that the URL being passed to the function does not contain a hostname. This could be due to the fact that the URL is not a complete HTTP URL, and hence does not have a hostname.

To fix the bug, you can modify the function to handle cases where there is no hostname present in the parsed URL. You can simply check if `parsed.hostname` exists before attempting to use it. If it doesn't, you can provide a default hostname, or handle the case accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    else:
        # Default hostname, or handle the case accordingly
        s += b"Host: example.com\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
        
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

This corrected function checks if a hostname exists in the parsed URL and handles the case where the hostname is not present.
