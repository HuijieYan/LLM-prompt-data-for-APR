Potential error location: The error occurs in the `request_httprepr` function at the line `s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"`.

Reasons behind the bug: The `parsed.hostname` is returning `None` for non-HTTP requests, which is causing the `to_bytes` function to raise a `TypeError` since it cannot handle a NoneType object.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: We can modify the code to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None`. We can also ensure that it doesn't result in a `None` value if it's not applicable to the type of request being made. Another approach could be to use a default hostname if `parsed.hostname` is `None`.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
