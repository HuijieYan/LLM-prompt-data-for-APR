Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the code is the usage of the `urlparse_cached` and `urlunparse` functions, which are not defined in the given code snippet. It seems like these functions are supposed to parse and reconstruct the URL, but they are missing from the code.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `urlparse_cached` and `urlunparse` functions are not defined in the given code, leading to a NameError. These functions are necessary for parsing and reconstructing the URL, and without them, the function will not work as intended.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Define the `urlparse_cached` and `urlunparse` functions within the same file or import them from the appropriate module, such as `urllib.parse`.
2. Handle the parsing and reconstruction of the URL in a different way, using built-in Python libraries or classes.

Corrected Code:
```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = request.method.encode('utf-8') + b" " + path.encode('utf-8') + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + parsed.hostname.encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string().encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
