Potential error location: The error occurs in the line `s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"` where `parsed.hostname` seems to be None, leading to a TypeError when trying to convert it to bytes.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `parsed` variable appears to be None instead of a `ParseResult` object, which is unexpected.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add a check to ensure that `parsed` is not None before attempting to access its attributes like `hostname`.
2. Handle the case where `parsed` is None by either providing a default value for `hostname` or raising an appropriate exception.

Corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
from six.moves.urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    if not parsed:
        # Handle the case when parsing the URL fails
        raise ValueError('Failed to parse the URL')
    
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected code:
- We have added a check to ensure that `parsed` is not None before accessing `parsed.hostname`.
- We also added a case to handle if parsing the URL fails, which is represented by a non-existent `parsed` object.
