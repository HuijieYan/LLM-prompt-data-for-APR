The error message indicates a TypeError in the `to_bytes` function, specifically when it tries to convert `parsed.hostname` to bytes, but the value of `parsed.hostname` is `None`.

The bug occurred because the `parsed.hostname` is `None`, and `to_bytes` function does not handle this case properly, resulting in a TypeError. This is likely due to the fact that the URL given to the function does not have a hostname.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` by providing a default value. We can modify the `parsed.hostname` to use an empty string if it's `None`.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
from six.moves.urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    """
    Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """

    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname or '') + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

This corrected code handles the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` by providing an empty string as the default value. This prevents the TypeError from occurring when using `to_bytes` function to convert `parsed.hostname` to bytes.
