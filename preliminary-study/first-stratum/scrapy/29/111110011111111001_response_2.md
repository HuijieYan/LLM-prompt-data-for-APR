The error occurs when the function is trying to concatenate the hostname with the byte string. It seems that the hostname might be `None`, which is not allowed while converting to bytes.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where the `parsed.hostname` is `None`. We can check if `parsed.hostname` exists before converting it to bytes and concatenating it with the byte string.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from six.moves.urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + (to_bytes(parsed.hostname) if parsed.hostname else b"") + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With these changes, we are now safely handling the case where `parsed.hostname` might be `None`, preventing the `TypeError` that was occurring.
