Potential Error:
The potential error in the function is the use of the `urlparse_cached` function and `urlunparse` function, which are not defined in the given code. This will cause the code to raise a NameError when executed.

Reason:
The code is trying to use functions `urlparse_cached` and `urlunparse` to parse and manipulate the URL, but these functions are not defined within the given code. This results in a NameError as the interpreter is unable to find these functions.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Import the necessary modules that contain the `urlparse_cached` and `urlunparse` functions if they are external libraries.
2. Use the `urllib.parse` module to access the `urlparse` and `urlunparse` functions.

Corrected Code:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = request.method.encode('utf-8') + b" " + path.encode('utf-8') + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + parsed.hostname.encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string().encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
