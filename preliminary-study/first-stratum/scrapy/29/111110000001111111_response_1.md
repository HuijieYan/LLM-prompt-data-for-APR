The potential error in the given function is that the `urlparse_cached` and `urlunparse` functions are not defined in the code, resulting in a `NameError`. Additionally, the `to_bytes` function is also not defined.

The `NameError` occurs because the functions `urlparse_cached`, `urlunparse`, and `to_bytes` are not built-in functions in Python. These functions seem to be related to URL parsing and encoding, which suggests that they might be part of an external library or module.

To fix the bug:
1. Import the necessary libraries or modules that provide the `urlparse_cached`, `urlunparse`, and `to_bytes` functions.
2. If these functions are custom implementations, define them within the code.

Here is the corrected code with the assumption that the required functions are available in the `urlparse` module from the `urllib` library:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    """
    Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """

    parsed = urlparse(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = request.method.encode('utf-8') + b" " + path.encode('utf-8') + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + parsed.hostname.encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string().encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

This should resolve the `NameError` issue and provide the expected functionality for the `request_httprepr` function.
