The error message indicates that the `to_bytes` function is receiving a `NoneType` object instead of a unicode, str, or bytes object. This occurs when trying to concatenate the "Host" and the parsed hostname.

The potential error location within the problematic function is at this line:
```python
s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `parsed.hostname` is resulting in a `NoneType` object.

To fix the bug, we can check if `parsed.hostname` is None before concatenating it with "Host". If it is None, we can provide a default value for the host.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """
    Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """

    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    if parsed.hostname:
        host = to_bytes(parsed.hostname)
    else:
        host = b"localhost"  # Provide a default value for the host
    
    s += b"Host: " + host + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
