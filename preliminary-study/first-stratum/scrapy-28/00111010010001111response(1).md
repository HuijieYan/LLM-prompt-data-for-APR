Potential error location: The problem seems to be in the `__init__` method of the `RFPDupeFilter` class. Specifically, in the part where it opens and reads from the file.

Reasons behind the bug:
1. The file is opened with mode 'a+' which means it points to the end of the file for writing. When reading, it may not read the contents properly.
2. The file should be opened in read mode to properly read the contents.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Open the file in read mode to read its contents.
2. Use a context manager (`with` statement) to properly handle file operations and ensure its closure after its use.

Corrected code:
```python
import os
import logging

class RFPDupeFilter(BaseDupeFilter):
    """
    Request Fingerprint duplicates filter
    """

    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            with open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'r') as file:
                self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in file)
```
