The potential error in the provided code is that the `__init__` method in the RFPDupeFilter class is not properly initialized with the correct parameters.

The `__init__` method is supposed to initialize the class attributes, but in this case, it is missing the `self` parameter, which is necessary to refer to the instance of the class.

The code is also missing the necessary import statements for the `os`, `logging`, and `shutil` modules.

To fix the bug, the `__init__` method should be modified to include the `self` parameter and the necessary imports should be added.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
import os
import logging

class RFPDupeFilter:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```

With these changes, the `__init__` method now includes the `self` parameter, which is necessary for referring to the instance of the class. Additionally, the required imports for the `os` and `logging` modules have been added.

The corrected code should fix the bug in the provided function.
