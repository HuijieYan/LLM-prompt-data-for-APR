Potential error location: the line `self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')` can cause an error if the path provided is invalid or the file cannot be opened.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug could be caused by the "path" parameter not being a valid directory, or the file "requests.seen" not being accessible for writing.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Check if the path provided is a valid directory before trying to open the file.
2. Handle the case where the file cannot be opened due to permission issues or other reasons.

Corrected code:

```python
import os
import logging

class ExampleClass:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path and os.path.isdir(path):
            file_path = os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen')
            try:
                self.file = open(file_path, 'a+')
                self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Error opening file: {e}")
```
