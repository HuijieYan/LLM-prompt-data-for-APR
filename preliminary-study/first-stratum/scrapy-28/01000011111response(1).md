1. The test case is checking the behavior of the RFPDupeFilter class, specifically the request_seen method. The error message indicates that the request_seen method is not behaving as expected, as the assertion for df2.request_seen(r1) is failing.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the initialization of the RFPDupeFilter class where the file is opened and fingerprints are updated.

3. The bug occurs because the file is being opened in 'a+' mode, which only allows appending to the file and does not support read operations. As a result, the fingerprints are not being read properly from the file.

4. To fix the bug, the file should be opened in 'r+' mode, which allows both reading and writing to the file. Additionally, the file pointer should be reset to the beginning of the file before reading the fingerprints.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import os
import logging

class RFPDupeFilter:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'r+')
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
            self.file.seek(0)  # Reset file pointer to the beginning
```

With these changes, the file is opened in 'r+' mode, and the file pointer is reset to the beginning after reading the fingerprints. This should fix the bug and ensure that the fingerprints are read correctly from the file.
