The issue seems to be with the `__init__` method of the `RFPDupeFilter` class, where the file is not being properly read and the fingerprints are not being stored. This leads to the `request_seen` method not being able to correctly check for duplicates.

The bug appears to be in the line `self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)`. It seems that the file is not being properly read and the fingerprints are not being stored in the `self.fingerprints` set.

To fix this bug, we need to read the file properly and store the fingerprints in the `self.fingerprints` set.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
import os
import logging

class RFPDupeFilter(BaseDupeFilter):
    """
    Request Fingerprint duplicates filter
    """

    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.path = os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen')
            if os.path.exists(self.path):
                with open(self.path, 'r') as file:
                    self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in file.readlines())
```

In this corrected code, the file is properly read using `with open(self.path, 'r') as file` and the fingerprints are stored in the `self.fingerprints` set using `self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in file.readlines())`. This should address the issue where the `request_seen` method fails to correctly check for duplicates.
