The bug is likely in the `__init__` function of the `RFPDupeFilter` class. The bug seems to be related to the file handling and reading the content of the file.

The issue might be with opening the file and reading its content. It seems that when the file is opened, its content is not being read properly or is not being processed as expected, leading to the incorrect behavior of the `request_seen` method.

To fix the bug, the file handling and reading logic should be reviewed and modified as needed.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` function:

```python
import os
import logging

class RFPDupeFilter(BaseDupeFilter):
    """
    Request Fingerprint duplicates filter
    """

    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            filepath = os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen')
            if os.path.exists(filepath):
                with open(filepath, 'r') as file:
                    self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in file.readlines())
            self.file = open(filepath, 'a+')
```

In the corrected code:
- We use `os.path.exists` to check if the file exists before attempting to open it.
- We open the file in `"r"` mode (read mode) using a `with` statement to ensure that the file is properly closed after reading its content.
- We use `file.readlines()` to read the lines of the file and update the `self.fingerprints` set with the stripped lines.

These changes should fix the bug and ensure that the `request_seen` method behaves as expected.
