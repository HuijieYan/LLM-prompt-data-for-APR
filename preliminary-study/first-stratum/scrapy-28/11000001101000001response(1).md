The potential error location within the problematic function is at the `open` method call, as it is being called without checking if the file is already open.

The error message indicates that the variable runtime information is not available due to the buggy function crashing, which suggests that the open method might be causing the crash.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `open` method is being called without checking if the file is already open, leading to a potential crash.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `open` method to check if the file is open before attempting to open it again.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
    self.file = None
    self.fingerprints = set()
    self.logdupes = True
    self.debug = debug
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    if path:
        if not self.file or self.file.closed:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```

By adding the check `if not self.file or self.file.closed`, we ensure that the file is only opened if it is not already open or closed. This should prevent any potential crashes and address the bug in the original function.
