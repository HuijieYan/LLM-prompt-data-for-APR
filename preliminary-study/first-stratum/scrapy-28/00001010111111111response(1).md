Potential error location: The potential error lies in the __init__ method of the RFPDupeFilter class where the open file is not properly handled.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug is likely caused due to the incorrect handling of opening and reading the file in the __init__ method. Additionally, there is a missing import statement for the 'os' module.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Import the 'os' module at the beginning of the file.
2. Add error handling for file open operations to ensure that the file is properly opened and read.
3. Use a context manager (with statement) to handle file operations to guarantee that the file is properly closed after its suite finishes, even if an exception is raised.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import os
import logging

class RFPDupeFilter:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            try:
                with open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+') as file:
                    self.file = file
                    self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
            except OSError as e:
                self.logger.exception("Error opening the file: %s", e)
```
With these changes, the open operation for the file is properly handled within a try-except block using a context manager. This will ensure that any potential file opening errors are caught and logged, preventing the function from crashing.
