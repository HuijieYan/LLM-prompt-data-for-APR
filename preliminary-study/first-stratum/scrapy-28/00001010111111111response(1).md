The error occurs when the test function `test_dupefilter_path` checks if the request `r1` is seen by `df2` using the `request_seen` method. This assertion fails, which indicates that the `request_seen` method is not working correctly.

The potential error location within the `__init__` function is the line:
`self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)`

The bug occurs because the file is opened in append mode ('a+'), so the file pointer is positioned at the end of the file. When trying to read the content of the file using `self.file`, there is nothing to read. 

To fix the bug, the file pointer should be moved to the beginning of the file before reading the content. This can be achieved by adding `self.file.seek(0)` after opening the file.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import os
import logging

class RFPDupeFilter:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
            self.file.seek(0)  # Move the file pointer to the beginning of the file
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```

By adding the `self.file.seek(0)` line, the file pointer is reset to the beginning of the file, allowing the content to be read correctly. This should fix the bug and allow the test function to pass without any assertion errors.
