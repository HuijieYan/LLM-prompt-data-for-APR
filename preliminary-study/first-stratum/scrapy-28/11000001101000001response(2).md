The issue with the given function is that it is missing the `self` parameter. Since the function is an `__init__` function of a class, it should have `self` as the first parameter to refer to the instance of the class.

The potential error in the code is at the function definition where it is missing the `self` parameter.

The bug occurred because the `__init__` function of a class should always have `self` as the first parameter, which represents the instance of the class. Without `self`, the instance attributes cannot be accessed or modified within the function.

To fix the bug, `self` parameter should be added as the first parameter to the `__init__` function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
    self.path = path
    self.debug = debug
    self.file = None
    self.fingerprints = set()
    self.logdupes = True
    self.debug = debug
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    if path:
        self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
        self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```
