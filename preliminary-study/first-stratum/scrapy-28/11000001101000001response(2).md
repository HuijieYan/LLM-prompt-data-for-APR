The potential error location within the problematic function is the `__init__` method, specifically the part where it initializes the file and fingerprints attributes.

The error message indicates that there is a problem with accessing the file to update the fingerprints.

The bug occurs because the file is being opened in append mode, and its contents are being used to update the fingerprints set. However, the file is not being closed after reading its contents, which may cause issues when attempting to update the fingerprints later.

One approach to fixing the bug is to ensure that the file is closed after reading its contents to update the fingerprints. Another approach is to use a `with` statement to ensure that the file is properly closed after its contents are read.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
import os

def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
    self.file = None
    self.fingerprints = set()
    self.logdupes = True
    self.debug = debug
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    if path:
        with open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+') as file:
            self.file = file
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```
