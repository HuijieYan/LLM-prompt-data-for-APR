The potential error location within the problematic function is the `__init__` method, specifically the part where it attempts to open a file and update the `self.fingerprints` set.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `path` parameter is not being used correctly to open the file. Additionally, it seems like the muted `set()` is not working as expected.

To fix the bug, the `open()` method should be called explicitly to open the file, and the `set()` should be used to initialize the `self.fingerprints` set, rather than using `update`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import os
import logging

class ClassName:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set() if path else set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)

    # other methods of the class...
```

In this corrected code, I've added a `class ClassName` to encompass the `__init__` method. I also initialized `self.fingerprints` with an empty set if `path` is `None`. Additionally, I explicitly call the `open()` method to open the file, and I use `set()` to initialize the `self.fingerprints` set.
