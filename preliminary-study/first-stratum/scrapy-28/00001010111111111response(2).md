The error occurs when the test checks if `df2` has seen the request `r1`. Since `df` and `df2` are initialized with the same path, `df2` inherits the existing fingerprints from `df` due to the bug in the `__init__` function. As a result, the assertion fails.

The bug occurs because the `__init__` function is not properly handling the case when the `path` parameter is provided. The function should open the file and update the fingerprints accordingly, but it is not doing so.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `__init__` function to correctly open the file and update the fingerprints.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` function:

```python
import os
import logging

class RFPDupeFilter:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.file_path = os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen')
            if os.path.exists(self.file_path):
                with open(self.file_path, 'r') as f:
                    self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in f)

    # other methods in the class...
```

With this fix, the `__init__` function now correctly opens the file and updates the fingerprints from the file when the `path` parameter is provided. This should resolve the bug and make the test case pass.
