The issue with the given buggy function is that it's not properly utilizing the "__init__" method to initialize the class attributes. The "__init__" method is used to initialize the instance of the class, and it should be defined within a class and take "self" as its first parameter.

The test case "test_dupefilter_path" is trying to create a new instance of the RFPDupeFilter class by providing a path, and then performing some operations on it. However, the buggy function "__init__" is not properly initializing the class attributes, which is likely causing the test case to fail with an AssertionError.

To fix the bug, the "__init__" method should be properly defined within the RFPDupeFilter class and it should properly initialize the class attributes.

Here's the corrected code for the RFPDupeFilter class:

```python
import logging
import os
import tempfile
import shutil
from scrapy.http import Request

class RFPDupeFilter:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.path = path
            self.file_path = os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen')

    def open(self):
        if self.path and not os.path.exists(self.file_path):
            open(self.file_path, 'w').close()
        if self.file_path:
            self.file = open(self.file_path, 'a+')
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)

    def close(self, message):
        if self.file:
            self.file.close()

    def request_seen(self, request):
        return request.fingerprint in self.fingerprints

# Test function remains the same
```

In this corrected code, I modified the "__init__" method to properly initialize the class attributes "path" and "file_path" based on the provided path. I also added the "open" and "close" methods to handle file operations.

By making these changes, the RFPDupeFilter class should now be properly initialized and the test case "test_dupefilter_path" should no longer fail with an AssertionError.
