Potential Error Location:
The issue seems to be in the __init__ method of the RFPDupeFilter class, which is not properly handling the 'path' parameter.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug is likely occurring because the __init__ method is not correctly opening the file located at the given path and is not reading the contents of the file properly to update the fingerprints set.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the file at the given path exists before attempting to open it.
2. Ensure that the file is properly opened in read mode to read its contents and update the fingerprints set accordingly.

Corrected Code:
```python
import os
import logging

class RFPDupeFilter:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            if os.path.exists(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen')):
                with open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'r') as file:
                    self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in file)
```

In the corrected code:
- We use os.path.exists to check if the file exists before opening it to prevent any potential FileNotFoundError.
- We then use the with open statement to ensure that the file is properly opened in read mode and its contents are read to update the fingerprints set.
