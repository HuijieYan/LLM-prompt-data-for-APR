The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the initialization of the `RFPDupeFilter` class. When the `path` parameter is provided, the function is supposed to open the file at the specified path and update the `fingerprints` attribute with the data from the file. However, the code does not handle the case where the file at the specified path does not exist, and it does not handle the file properly after opening it.

To fix this bug, the function should explicitly handle the case where the file does not exist at the specified path, and it should properly handle the file after opening it.

Here's the corrected code for the `RFPDupeFilter` class:

```python
import os
import logging

class RFPDupeFilter(BaseDupeFilter):
    """
    Request Fingerprint duplicates filter
    """

    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            if os.path.exists(path):  # Check if the file exists at the specified path
                with open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+') as file:
                    self.file = file
                    self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
            else:
                self.logger.warning("File does not exist at the specified path")

    # ... other methods ...
```

In the corrected code, we have added a check to see if the file exists at the specified path before opening it. We also use a context manager `with` to open the file, which ensures that the file is properly handled and closed after its use. Additionally, we added a warning log if the file does not exist at the specified path.
