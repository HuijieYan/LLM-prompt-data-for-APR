The issue is likely in the `__init__` function of the `RFPDupeFilter` class where the `open` method is being called. The bug seems to be related to the implementation of the `open` method, which is not provided in the given code.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be that the `open` method is not correctly implemented within the `RFPDupeFilter` class, which leads to the `AssertionError` in the test case.

To fix the bug, we need to implement the `open` method within the `RFPDupeFilter` class, so that it initializes the `self.file` attribute and sets up the necessary file operations. Additionally, the `close` method should also be implemented to properly close the file.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class RFPDupeFilter(BaseDupeFilter):
    """
    Request Fingerprint duplicates filter
    """

    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.path = os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen')
            self.open()

    def open(self):
        if self.path:
            self.file = open(self.path, 'a+')
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)

    def close(self, message):
        if self.file:
            # perform any necessary file operations before closing
            self.file.close()
            self.file = None
```

By implementing the `open` method and handling the file operations within it, the bug should be fixed. This code ensures that the file is properly opened and read during the initialization process.

The `close` method is also added to handle any necessary file operations before closing the file.
