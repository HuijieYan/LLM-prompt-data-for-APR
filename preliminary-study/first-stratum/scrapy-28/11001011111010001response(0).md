The potential error location within the problematic function is the `__init__` method where the path is being opened.

The bug occurs because the `open` method is missing in the provided code. It seems that the `open` method is intended to open the file specified in the path for reading and update the fingerprints set with the contents of the file.

To fix the bug, the `open` method should be added to the `RFPDupeFilter` class. This method should open the file and update the fingerprints set with the contents of the file.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import logging
import os

class RFPDupeFilter:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.open(path)
        
    def open(self, path):
        if path:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)

    # Other methods of the RFPDupeFilter class go here
```

With this corrected code, the `open` method will be called when a path is provided, and it will open the file and update the fingerprints set with its contents. This should resolve the issue and make the test function work without errors.
