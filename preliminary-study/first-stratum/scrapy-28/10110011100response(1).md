```python
# file name: /Users/jerry/.abw/BugsInPy_Dir/BugsInPy_Cloned_Repos/scrapy/scrapy/dupefilters.py

# class signature containing the buggy function
class RFPDupeFilter(BaseDupeFilter):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.path = path
            self.file_path = os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen')
```
The main issue in the original code was with the initialization of the file path. It was missing the assignment to `self.path` and `self.file_path`, which I have added to the corrected function.
