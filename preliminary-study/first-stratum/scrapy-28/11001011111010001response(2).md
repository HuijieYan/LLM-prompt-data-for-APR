The potential error in the `__init__` function lies in the code that handles the `path` parameter. When the `RFPDupeFilter` instance is created with a `path`, the `open` function is called, which in turn tries to open the file located at the given path for reading (`'a+'` mode) and updates the set of `fingerprints` with its contents.

The bug occurs because the `open` function is being called before the `path` check `if path:`. This means that `open` will be called even when `path` is `None` and will result in a `TypeError` when `os.path.join` is called with `None`.

To fix this bug, the `open` function should only be called when the `path` is not `None`. Any file operations should be performed inside a conditional block that checks if `path` is not `None`.

The corrected code for the `__init__` function is as follows:

```python
import os
import logging

class RFPDupeFilter:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        
        if path:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```

With this corrected code, the function checks whether `path` is not `None` before attempting to open the file and update the set of `fingerprints`. This should fix the bug and prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.
