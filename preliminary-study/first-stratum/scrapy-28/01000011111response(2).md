1. The test case is trying to test the RFPDupeFilter class by creating two requests, adding the first request to the filter, and checking if it is seen. The error message indicates that the request is not being correctly identified as seen, leading to an assertion error.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the initialization of the RFPDupeFilter class.

3. The bug occurs because the `__init__` method is not handling the `path` parameter correctly. It is trying to open a file and update fingerprints based on the file's content, but it does not handle the case when the file does not exist. Additionally, the method does not close the opened file, which can cause issues with file handling.

4. To fix the bug, we can update the `__init__` method to handle the `path` parameter properly, ensure that the opened file is closed after use, and handle potential errors related to file operations.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import os
import logging

class RFPDupeFilter:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            try:
                self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
                self.fingerprints.update(x.strip() for x in self.file)
            except FileNotFoundError:
                self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'w')
                self.file.close()

    def open(self):
        pass  # Add open logic if needed
    
    def request_seen(self, request):
        fingerprint = request.url  # Assuming url is used as fingerprint
        if fingerprint in self.fingerprints:
            return True
        self.fingerprints.add(fingerprint)
        self.file.write(fingerprint + '\n')  # Update file with new fingerprint
        return False

    def close(self, reason):
        if self.file:
            self.file.close()
```
