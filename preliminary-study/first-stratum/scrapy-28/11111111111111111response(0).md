Potential error location: The 'path' argument is being used to open a file, but it's not being handled correctly if the file does not exist.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug is likely caused by the 'path' argument not being handled correctly when the file does not exist. This can lead to unexpected behavior when trying to open the file.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the file exists before trying to open it.
2. If the file does not exist, create it before opening it.
3. Ensure proper error handling in case the file cannot be created or opened.

Corrected code:

```python
class RFPDupeFilter(BaseDupeFilter):
    """
    Request Fingerprint duplicates filter
    """

    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            if not os.path.exists(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen')):
                with open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'w') as file:
                    pass
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```
