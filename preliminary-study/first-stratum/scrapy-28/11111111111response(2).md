1. The test case is creating two Request objects and then using the RFPDupeFilter class to check if the requests have been seen or not. It is asserting that the first request should not be seen, then it should be seen, and the second request should be seen. However, the error message indicates that the second assertion is failing.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the `__init__` method, specifically the line `self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)`. This line is responsible for updating the set of fingerprints with the existing data from the file.

3. The bug is occurring because the `self.file` object is not being closed after opening and reading from it. This means that the data from the file is not being properly read and updated into the `self.fingerprints` set.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the file is properly closed after reading from it. This can be done by using a `with` statement when opening the file, which will automatically close the file after the block of code is executed.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import os
import logging

class RFPDupeFilter(BaseDupeFilter):
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            with open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+') as file:
                self.file = file
                self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```
