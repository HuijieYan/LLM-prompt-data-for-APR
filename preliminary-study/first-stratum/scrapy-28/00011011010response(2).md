The corrected function would be:

```python
import os
import logging

class RFPDupeFilter:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)

    def open(self):
        pass

    def close(self, status='finished'):
        pass

    def request_seen(self, request):
        pass
```

Here, the corrected function has been defined within a class and the necessary import statements have been added at the beginning of the code. The open, close, and request_seen methods need to be implemented according to the requirement.
