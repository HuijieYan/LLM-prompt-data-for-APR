1. The test case `test_comment_in_decorator` is failing with an assertion error. It seems that the expected and actual outputs are not matching as per the test case.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be the logic for handling empty lines before and after certain code constructs.

3. The bug occurs because the logic for handling empty lines before and after certain code constructs is not correctly implemented. This is causing incorrect insertion or omission of empty lines, leading to the mismatch between expected and actual outputs.

4. To fix the bug, we need to review and refactor the logic for handling empty lines before and after code constructs. Proper conditions and logic need to be applied for inserting or omitting empty lines based on different scenarios.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), 1)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
