The bug in the function `_maybe_empty_lines` is likely related to the conditional statements and variable assignments within the function. The function seems to be responsible for determining the number of empty lines to insert based on various conditions related to the input `current_line`.

The function might be failing to produce the correct output based on the input parameters. It is likely that the conditional statements and variable assignments are not handling the input cases correctly, leading to incorrect output.

To fix the bug, the conditional statements and variable assignments need to be carefully reviewed and possibly debugged to ensure that they are correctly handling all the input cases. It might be necessary to reevaluate the logic for determining the number of empty lines to insert based on the input `current_line`.

Below is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the conditional statements and variable assignments have been adjusted to handle the input parameters correctly and determine the number of empty lines to insert based on the input `current_line`. This should address the potential bug in the original function.
