The potential error in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the conditional logic and variable assignments within the function. Based on the cases provided, the function is not returning the expected values according to the input parameters.

The main reasons behind the bug could be related to incorrect conditional checks and variable assignments within the function. The conditional checks for `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield` are not being handled correctly. Additionally, the handling of `previous_line` and `previous_defs` could also be causing the unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, the conditional logic and variable assignments should be reconsidered and potentially restructured. The handling of `previous_line` and `previous_defs` need to be reviewed to ensure that the correct behavior is being captured for empty lines and related line properties.

Below is the corrected implementation for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = "" 
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    if (current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class) and not current_line.is_flow_control:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
    
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
    
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

In the corrected implementation, the conditional logic for handling different line properties and the handling of `previous_line` and `previous_defs` have been revised to ensure the correct behavior and expected return values. This should address the bugs in the original function.
