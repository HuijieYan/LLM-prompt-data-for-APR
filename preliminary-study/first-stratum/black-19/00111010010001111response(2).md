The problem seems to be with the `call` function, which is not provided in the code. The variables `before` and `newlines` are used in the buggy function, but they are not defined or returned from the function. This results in a NameError.

To fix this issue:
1. Add proper variable definitions and return statements for `before` and `newlines` at the end of the function.
2. If there are global variables being used, make sure they are defined or imported properly within the function.

Here's the corrected code for the `call` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    # ... previous code ...

    before = 0
    newlines = 0
    
    # ... remaining code ...
    
    return before, newlines
```
Remember to update this function as per your requirements, as I am not aware of the full context of the code.
