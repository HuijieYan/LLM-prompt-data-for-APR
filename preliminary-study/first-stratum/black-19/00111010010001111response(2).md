The error occurs in the `_maybe_empty_lines` method of the `EmptyLineTracker` class. The method has conditional statements with multiple checks based on the current line and previous line properties. The bug could be related to the conditional logic inside the function.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to review the logic inside the `_maybe_empty_lines` method and ensure that the conditional checks are appropriately handling all possible cases based on the input parameters.

Here's the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` method:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    after = 0
    
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        before = 2
        after = 0
    elif current_line.depth > 0 and current_line.is_decorator:
        before = 1
        after = 1
    elif current_line.depth > 0 and (current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class):
        before = 1
        after = 0
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        before = 0
        after = 1
    elif (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        before = 1
        after = 0
    elif (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        before = 1
        after = 0
    else:
        before = 0
        after = 0

    return before, after
```

In the corrected code, each conditional block is structured to handle specific cases based on the input parameters, and the logic is simplified to ensure that all cases are appropriately handled. This should address the potential bug in the original function.
