The bug occurs in the `_maybe_empty_lines` method, where there are multiple conditional statements that are modifying the `before` variable based on different conditions. The issue seems to arise from the logic for handling empty lines before decorators, classes, and function definitions, as well as manipulating the `self.previous_defs` list.

The potential error seems to be related to the manipulation of the `before` variable and the `self.previous_defs` list based on various conditions. Additionally, the logic for handling empty lines before decorators, classes, and function definitions seems to be incorrect.

The reason behind the bug could be that the conditions and logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` method are not correctly handling the cases for determining the number of empty lines to be added before certain line types and the management of the `self.previous_defs` list.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling empty lines before decorators, classes, and function definitions should be carefully reviewed and corrected. Additionally, the manipulation of the `before` variable and the `self.previous_defs` list should be revised to ensure the correct behavior based on different conditions.

Here is the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` method:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected code revises the logic for handling the number of empty lines before different line types and also addresses the manipulation of the `before` variable and the `self.previous_defs` list based on different conditions.
