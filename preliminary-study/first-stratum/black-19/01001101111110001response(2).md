The error message suggests a mismatch between the expected and actual output of the `test_comment_in_decorator` test case. The expected output includes extra newline characters that are not present in the actual output.

The issue is likely related to the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. Looking at the code and the input parameters, it appears that the function is altering the number of newline characters based on certain conditions, which may not be consistent with the expected behavior.

One potential reason for the bug could be incorrect handling of newline characters in the `before` variable or in the conditional statements that determine the number of newlines to return.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to review the logic for handling newline characters and adjust it to ensure that the expected output matches the actual output for different test cases.

Here's a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    before = 0
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if not self.previous_line:
            return 0, 0
    
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
    
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

This corrected code ensures that the handling of newline characters is consistent and should address the issue observed in the test case.
