The error seems to be related to the insertion of empty lines between comments, decorators, and code. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining where to insert empty lines, and the error seems to be related to this insertion logic.

The error occurs because the function does not handle the case where a comment is followed by a decorator or other code elements. It should insert empty lines in these cases, but it doesn't do so correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for inserting empty lines. We should update the logic to handle cases where comments are followed by decorators or other code elements.

Here's the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    # ... (omitting other parts of the function for brevity)

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    # Add logic to insert empty lines when needed based on comments and code elements
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_comment \
            and (current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not any(
            [
                current_line.is_import,
                current_line.is_yield
                and depth != self.previous_line.depth,
            ]
        )
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the updated logic, we have added a new condition to handle cases where comments are followed by decorators, `def`, `class`, or import statements.

This updated logic should now correctly handle the insertion of empty lines, addressing the bug observed in the test case.
