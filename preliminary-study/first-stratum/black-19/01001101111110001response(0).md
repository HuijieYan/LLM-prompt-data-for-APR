The error is occurring due to the unexpected output of the function compared to the expected output in the test case `test_comment_in_decorator`. The error message indicates that the line spacing is different between the expected and actual outputs, specifically after the `# TODO: X`, `# TODO: Y`, and `# TODO: Z` comments.

Upon analysis, it seems that the function `_maybe_empty_lines` is not handling the insertion of empty lines correctly under certain conditions, leading to the wrong output.

The potential error location within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function could be the logic for handling empty lines in different cases. Specifically, the conditions and checks for inserting empty lines before or after specific constructs such as decorators, defs, classes, imports, etc. might be incorrect.

The bug seems to be occurring due to incorrect handling of empty lines and the logic surrounding when to insert them.

One possible approach for fixing the bug could be to carefully review and refactor the logic for inserting empty lines. Specifically, the conditions for when to insert empty lines and the number of empty lines to be inserted in each case need to be validated.

Here's the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line and not self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if not current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 1 if current_line.depth == 0 else 0, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return 1, 0

    return 0, 0
```

The corrected code includes refactored conditions and logic to determine the insertion of empty lines based on the specific cases mentioned in the function. This should address the buggy behavior and ensure the correct insertion of empty lines in the output.
