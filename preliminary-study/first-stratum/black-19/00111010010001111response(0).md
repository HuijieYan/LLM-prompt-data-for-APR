The error in the provided code seems to be causing an assertion error in the test case `test_comment_in_decorator`. The assertion error occurs when comparing the expected output with the actual output generated by the function. This likely indicates that the function is not producing the expected output.

Upon analyzing the function `_maybe_empty_lines`, it appears that the logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line is complex and contains multiple conditional statements.

One potential source of the bug could be the mixed use of `self.previous_line` and `self.previous_defs`. These variables are used to track the previous line and its indentation depth. It seems that the function may not be handling these references correctly, leading to incorrect computations.

To fix the bug, it's important to ensure that the logic for handling previous lines and their indentation depths is correct. Additionally, the conditional statements for different line types (decorator, def, class, flow control, import, yield) need to be carefully reviewed to ensure they are producing the correct output.

Based on the complexity of the logic, it might also be beneficial to refactor the function into smaller, more manageable parts to improve readability and maintainability.

Below is the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return 1, 0
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return 1, 0

    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    return before, 0
```
In the corrected code, the structure of the conditional statements has been rearranged for better readability and to ensure
