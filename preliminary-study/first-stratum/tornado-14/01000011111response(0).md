1. The test case 'test_force_current' is attempting to create an IOLoop instance with the 'make_current' parameter set to True. It then calls the 'initialize' method, which in turn should initialize the IOLoop instance. However, the error message indicates that the RuntimeError is being raised when checking if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None.

2. The potential error location is within the 'initialize' method, specifically in the section that compares whether IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None.

3. The bug occurs because the logic in the initialize method is flawed. The if condition checks if make_current is None, and if so, it checks if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None. If it is, the 'make_current' method is called. However, if make_current is not None, then it checks if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None and raises a RuntimeError if it is not None. This logic is incorrect and contradictory.

4. To fix the bug, we should check if make_current is True, then the 'make_current' method should be called. Otherwise, if make_current is None, then we should check if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None and call 'make_current' if it is.

5. Here's the corrected code for the initialize method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
        else:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    elif make_current is None:  # Use is None instead of ==
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```
