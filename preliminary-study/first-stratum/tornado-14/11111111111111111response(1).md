The error occurs because the `initialize` method is checking for the current instance of `IOLoop` using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` and then trying to raise an error if it returns `None`. However, this logic is flawed, as it should actually raise an error if it is not `None`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `initialize` method to check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None` and then raise an error if this condition is met.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this fix, the `initialize` method will correctly raise an error if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists when `make_current` is set to `True`.

This should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that the method behaves as expected in the given test case.
