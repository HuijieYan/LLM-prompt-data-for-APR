The test case `test_force_current` is attempting to create an `IOLoop` instance with the `make_current` parameter set to `True`. It then checks if the created instance is the current `IOLoop` instance. After that, it tries to create a second `IOLoop` instance with `make_current` set to `True`, expecting it to fail and raise a `RuntimeError`. However, the test fails with a `RuntimeError` in the first attempt itself.

The error message indicates that a `RuntimeError` is being raised with the message "current IOLoop already exists" at line 253 in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. This message contradicts the condition that checks if the current `IOLoop` is None, causing confusion about the actual state of the current `IOLoop`.

The potential error location is within the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class, specifically in the conditional statements that check if the current `IOLoop` is None or if it already exists.

The bug occurs because the conditional logic in the `initialize` method is not properly handling the case when `make_current` is set to `True`. It is incorrectly handling the scenario where a current `IOLoop` already exists and should not allow a new `IOLoop` to be made current.

To fix this bug, the conditional logic in the `initialize` method needs to be modified to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True`. It should first check if a current `IOLoop` instance exists and only then decide whether to raise a `RuntimeError` or make the new instance current.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this modification, the `initialize` method will correctly handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True` and avoid raising a `RuntimeError` when a current `IOLoop` already exists.

This fix should address the issue reported in the test case, and the test `test_force_current` should pass without raising any `RuntimeError`.
