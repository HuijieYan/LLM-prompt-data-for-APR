The buggy code is the `initialize` method of a class. The code is intended to initialize the IOLoop instance, and if `make_current` is True, it should check if the IOLoop instance already exists and raise a `RuntimeError` if it does.

The potential error location is in the `initialize` method, where the condition to check if an IOLoop instance already exists is incorrect. 

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the if-else condition for `make_current` is not correctly handling the scenario where `make_current` is True and an IOLoop instance already exists.

To fix the bug, the code should first check if `make_current` is True and an IOLoop instance already exists. If that is the case, it should raise a `RuntimeError`. If `make_current` is True and an IOLoop instance doesn't exist, the code should then call the `make_current` method to create the IOLoop instance.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:  # handle the case when make_current is explicitly provided
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` method should now correctly handle the scenario where `make_current` is True and an IOLoop instance already exists. The test case should now pass without raising a `RuntimeError`.
