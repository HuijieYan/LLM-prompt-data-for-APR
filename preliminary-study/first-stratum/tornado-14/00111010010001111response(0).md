The issue arises from the fact that the `initialize` function is trying to check if the `IOLoop.current` instance is `None` and then raise an error if `make_current` is `True`. However, the logic seems to be flawed because if `make_current` is `True`, it should raise an error only if `IOLoop.current` instance is NOT `None`.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and the check for the current instance of `IOLoop`.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected code, we modified the logic inside the `elif make_current` block to check if `IOLoop.current` instance is not `None`, and only then raise an error.

This should fix the issue and ensure that the `initialize` function behaves as expected based on the `make_current` parameter.
