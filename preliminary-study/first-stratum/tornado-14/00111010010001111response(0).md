The error occurs due to the `if-elif` condition in the `initialize` function. 

The `initialize` function checks if `make_current` is `None` and then checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, and if it is not `None`, it tries to make the current IOLoop and raises an error if it already exists. 

The potential issue is that when `make_current` is `True`, it should try to make the current IOLoop without checking if it already exists. Instead, it should always try to make the current IOLoop and raise an error only if it's trying to create a duplicate IOLoop.

The corrected code for the `initialize` function is as follows:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        self.make_current()  # Always try to make the current IOLoop if make_current is None
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
