The bug occurs in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The problem is that when `make_current` is `True`, the code checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`. If it is `None`, it tries to make the current instance but then raises an error saying "current IOLoop already exists", which is contradictory.

To fix the bug, we can remove the `if` condition that checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` when `make_current` is `True`. We can assume that if `make_current` is `True`, it means that the current instance already exists and we simply need to make it the current one.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
# Corrected initialize method
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

By making these changes, we ensure that the logic is consistent and that the behavior is as expected when `make_current` is `True`.
