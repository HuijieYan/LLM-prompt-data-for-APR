The bug occurs within the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The `initialize` method checks if the `make_current` parameter is `None` and if the current IOLoop instance is `None`. If both conditions are satisfied, it calls `self.make_current()`. However, if `make_current` is `True`, it raises a RuntimeError, even if the current IOLoop instance is `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic within the `initialize` method. If `make_current` is `True`, we should check if the current IOLoop instance is `not None` before attempting to make it the current instance. If it is `None`, then we should raise the RuntimeError. Otherwise, we can proceed with making the IOLoop instance the current one.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the code now checks if the `make_current` parameter is `True` and if the current IOLoop instance is `not None` before raising a RuntimeError.
