The issue with the `initialize` function is that it is trying to access the `make_current` method directly as if it were a class method, but it is actually an instance method.

In the `initialize` method, `make_current` is being used as a method of the instance rather than a method of the class, but it is intended to be a method of the class.

To fix this issue, we need to call the `make_current` method using the `self` parameter as it is an instance method.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected code, we are calling the `current` and `make_current` methods on the instance `self`, as they are intended to be instance methods.

This should resolve the issue and the test function `test_force_current` should run without any errors.
