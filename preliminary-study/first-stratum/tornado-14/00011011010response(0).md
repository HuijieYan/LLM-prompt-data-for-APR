The corrected and fixed function is as follows:

```python
# relative function's signature in this file
def current(instance=True):
    # ... omitted code ...

# relative function's signature in this file
def make_current(self):
    # ... omitted code ...

# this is the corrected function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

The issue in the original code is that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is used to determine if the IOLoop already exists, but it is then followed by raising an error for "current IOLoop already exists". This is contradictory. The corrected code checks if the IOLoop instance exists and raises an error if it does, and vice versa.
