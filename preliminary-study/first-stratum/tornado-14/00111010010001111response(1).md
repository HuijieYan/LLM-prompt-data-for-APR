The issue here is that when `make_current` is set to `True`, the code is raising a `RuntimeError` even when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is returning `None`. This should not be the case.

The bug is occurring in the conditional statement `if make_current:`. It is incorrectly checking if the current IOLoop instance is `None` when `make_current` is `True`, and raising a `RuntimeError` if it is not `None`. This is the opposite of the intended behavior.

To fix this bug, the conditional statement should be changed to check if the current IOLoop instance is not `None` when `make_current` is `True`. The corrected code for the `initialize` function is as follows:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will behave as expected and will not raise a `RuntimeError` when it shouldn't.
