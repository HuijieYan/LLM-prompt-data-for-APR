The error occurs in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The function is designed to initialize the IOLoop and set it as the current IOLoop if necessary. 

In the test case `test_force_current`, the IOLoop is initialized with `make_current=True`, which should make the new IOLoop the current IOLoop. However, the test fails with a `RuntimeError` stating that the current IOLoop already exists.

The potential error location is within the conditional block for `make_current=True` in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the conditional check for `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is not working properly. This condition should check if there is already a current instance of the IOLoop. If no instance exists, then the new IOLoop should be made current. However, the conditional check seems to be failing, leading to the incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, the conditional check for `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` needs to be revised. It should be replaced with a check to ensure that the current IOLoop instance exists. If it doesn't exist, then the new IOLoop should be made current. If the current IOLoop already exists, then a `RuntimeError` should be raised.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the conditional checks ensure that the correct behavior is followed, making the new IOLoop the current IOLoop if it doesn't already exist, and raising a `RuntimeError` if it does.

This should address the issue and ensure that the IOLoop is initialized correctly based on the `make_current` parameter.
