The error in the buggy function "initialize" is due to the incorrect usage of the "make_current" parameter. 

The bug occurs because the "initialize" function is not correctly handling the "make_current" parameter. The function is trying to check the current IOLoop instance and correctly make it the current one, but the logic is flawed. 

To fix the bug, we can modify the "initialize" function to check if the current IOLoop instance already exists and only make it the current one if it does not. 

Here's the corrected code for the "initialize" function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=True):
    if make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
``` 

With this corrected code, the "initialize" function will now correctly handle the "make_current" parameter and ensure that the current IOLoop instance is set appropriately.
