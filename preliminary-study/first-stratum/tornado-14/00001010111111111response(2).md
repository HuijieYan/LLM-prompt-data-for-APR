The problem lies in the `initialize` method of the `KQueueIOLoop` class. The `initialize` method takes an optional parameter `make_current`, and based on its value, it either calls `self.make_current()` or raises a `RuntimeError`. 

The error message suggests that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is always evaluated to False, even when `make_current` is True. This means that the existing IOLoop instance is not being correctly detected.

The issue is likely due to the incorrect usage of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` inside the `initialize` method. It seems that the code is trying to check if an IOLoop instance already exists, but the current implementation is not working as intended.

To fix this bug, we can directly use the `current` method of the `IOLoop` class instead of calling it on the class itself. This will ensure that the correct IOLoop instance is being checked.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if self.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this modification, the `initialize` method will correctly check for the existence of an IOLoop instance and handle the `make_current` parameter accordingly.
