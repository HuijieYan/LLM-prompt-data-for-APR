1. The test case attempts to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and then checks if this new instance is the current instance using `IOLoop.current()`. The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError` is being raised because the current `IOLoop` already exists.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `initialize` method on line 252 where the `RuntimeError` is being raised.

3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `initialize` method is not properly handling the case where the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`. As a result, it incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` when it should not.

4. To fix the bug, we can modify the logic in the `initialize` method to correctly handle the case where the current `IOLoop` does not exist.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None and current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In this corrected code, we first retrieve the current instance of `IOLoop` and then use it to check if it exists or not. We also modify the logic to ensure that the `make_current` parameter is `True` only if the current instance is not already set.
