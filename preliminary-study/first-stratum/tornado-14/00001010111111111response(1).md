The error occurs because the `initialize` method is checking if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, and if it is not None, it raises a `RuntimeError`. This seems to be contradictory and may indicate a logic error in the code.

To fix the issue, we need to update the `initialize` method to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter. It should check if the current IOLoop instance exists and then decide whether to create a new one based on the value of `make_current`.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected code, we first check if `make_current` is None. If it is None, we create a new IOLoop instance only if there is no current IOLoop instance. If `make_current` is True, we create a new IOLoop instance only if there is no current IOLoop instance. If there is a current instance, we raise a `RuntimeError` because we do not want to create another instance.

By making these changes, we ensure that the `initialize` method behaves as expected and handles the `make_current` parameter correctly.
