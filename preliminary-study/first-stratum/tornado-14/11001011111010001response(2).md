The buggy function 'initialize' takes a parameter 'make_current' and is intended to initialize the current IOLoop. The bug occurs when 'make_current' is set to True, but the current IOLoop already exists, causing the RuntimeError to be raised.

The bug occurs in the 'initialize' function where it checks if the current IOLoop exists, and if not, it creates a new one. However, when 'make_current' is set to True, it directly tries to create a new IOLoop without checking if the current one exists, leading to the RuntimeError.

To fix this bug, we should revise the logic in the 'initialize' function to only create a new IOLoop if one doesn't already exist.

Here's the corrected code for the 'initialize' function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    else:
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected code, we first check if make_current is True and a current IOLoop instance exists. If it does, we raise a RuntimeError. If not, we create a new IOLoop instance. If make_current is False or None, we check if a current IOLoop instance exists and create a new one if it doesn't.

With this correction, the 'initialize' function should work as intended and the test case should pass without raising the RuntimeError.
