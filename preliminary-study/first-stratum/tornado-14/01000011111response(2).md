1. The test case is trying to create a new IOLoop instance with the "make_current" parameter set to True. This triggers the initialize method, which checks if an IOLoop instance already exists and raises a RuntimeError if it does.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statement "if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:".

3. The bug occurs because the conditional statement checks if the IOLoop instance is None, and if it is, it calls the "self.make_current()" method. However, in the case where make_current is True, the IOLoop instance already exists, so the conditional statement should not call "self.make_current()". This results in the RuntimeError being raised incorrectly.

4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statement to properly handle the case where make_current is True and an IOLoop instance already exists.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:  # Handles both cases when make_current is True or False
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if IOLoop instance already exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By modifying the conditional statement to handle both cases when make_current is True or False, and correctly checking for the existence of an IOLoop instance, we can fix the bug.
