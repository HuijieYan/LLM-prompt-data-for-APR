The bug is occurring in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The method checks if `make_current` is None, and if so, it calls `self.make_current()`. If `make_current` is not None, it should then check if an IOLoop already exists, and if not, call `self.make_current()`. However, the current logic does not correctly implement this behavior.

The reason for the bug is that the `initialize` method is not checking the conditions properly before calling `self.make_current()`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` method to correctly check the conditions and call `self.make_current()` as needed.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` method checks if `make_current` is None and if there is no current IOLoop, and calls `self.make_current()` in that case. Otherwise, it checks if `make_current` is True and if there is no current IOLoop, and calls `self.make_current()` in that case. If there is already a current IOLoop and `make_current` is True, it raises a RuntimeError.
