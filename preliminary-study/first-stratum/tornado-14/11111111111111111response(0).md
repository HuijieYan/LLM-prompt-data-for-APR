The error occurs in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The problem arises from the logic in the `initialize` method where it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`. If it is `None`, it calls the `make_current` method. However, if `make_current` is `True`, it should not raise an error if the current `IOLoop` is already set.

To fix this issue, the logic in the `initialize` method needs to be updated to correctly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other methods)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this fix, the `initialize` method first checks the current `IOLoop` instance and then makes the decision based on the value of `make_current`. If `make_current` is `True` and the current instance exists, it raises an error as expected.

This fix should address the bug and make the `initialize` method behave as expected.
