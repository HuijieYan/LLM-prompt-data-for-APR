The bug occurs in the `initialize` method of the `KQueueIOLoop` class. The method is supposed to initialize the `make_current` attribute, but it is not doing so correctly. 

The reason behind the bug is that the `initialize` method is not properly checking the value of `make_current` before executing the logic. It is also not using the correct method to check if the current IOLoop already exists.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` method should properly check the value of `make_current` and use the `IOLoop.current()` method to check if the current IOLoop already exists.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` method will properly initialize the `make_current` attribute and check if the current IOLoop already exists before creating a new one.
