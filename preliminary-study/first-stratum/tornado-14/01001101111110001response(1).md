The issue in the provided code is that the `initialize` function is not using the correct references for the `current` and `make_current` functions. It seems that the `IOLoop` class has its own `current` and `make_current` functions, and the `initialize` function should be using these class functions instead of the global ones.

The error occurs because when `make_current` is set to `True`, the code is checking if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` and if not, it raises a `RuntimeError`. However, it should be calling the `make_current` function of the `IOLoop` class.

To fix the bug, the code should be corrected as follows:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if self.__class__.current(instance=False) is None:  # Calling the class method
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if self.__class__.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Calling the class method
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected code, we are using `self.__class__.current(instance=False)` to call the class method and `self.make_current()` to call the instance method, which seems to be the intended behavior based on the existing code.
