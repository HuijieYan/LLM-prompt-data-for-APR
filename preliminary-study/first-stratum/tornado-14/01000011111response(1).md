1. The test case is trying to initialize an IOLoop instance with the `make_current` parameter set to True. However, during the initialization process, the `initialize` function is raising a RuntimeError with the message "current IOLoop already exists." This suggests that the bug might be in the logic of the `initialize` function when handling the `make_current` parameter.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional check for the `make_current` parameter.

3. The bug occurs because the logic for checking the existence of the current IOLoop is incorrect. The initial condition `if make_current is None:` checks if the `make_current` parameter is None, and if so, tries to create a new IOLoop instance. However, when `make_current` is True, it raises a RuntimeError without checking if the current IOLoop already exists.

4. To fix the bug, we should modify the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter. We should check if a current IOLoop already exists before attempting to create a new one if `make_current` is True.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function will correctly check whether a current IOLoop instance already exists before trying to create a new one when `make_current` is True.
