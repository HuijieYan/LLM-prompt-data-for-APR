1. The test case is trying to group time series data by a daily frequency, where the time index is in UTC and then converted to the "America/Havana" timezone, which is subject to daylight saving time (DST) changes. The test fails with an AmbiguousTimeError due to the presence of ambiguous timestamps on the clock change day in Cuba.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of midnight timestamps on the clock change day in the `_get_time_bins` method.

3. The bug occurs because the code does not handle the ambiguous timestamps correctly, especially when creating binners and labels based on the frequency (`self.freq`) and time zone (`ax.tz`) of the input time index. This leads to an AmbiguousTimeError when trying to group the data by daily frequency, as some timestamps are ambiguous due to DST changes.

4. To fix the bug, it's necessary to handle ambiguous timestamps correctly when creating binners and labels. This can be achieved by updating the code to use the `DST`-aware utility functions in pandas for creating frequency-based binners and labels for ambiguous timestamps.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` method:

```python
import pandas as pd

# signature of a relative function in this class
def _adjust_bin_edges(self, binner, ax_values):
    # ... omitted code ...


# corrected function
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = pd.DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # Use DST-aware utility functions to create frequency-based binners and labels
    binner = labels = pd.date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
        normalize=True  # Normalize the timestamps to avoid ambiguous time errors
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = pd.api.types.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, pd.NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, pd.NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
In the corrected code, we have added the `normalize=True` argument to the `pd.date_range` function to ensure that timestamps are normalized, which helps in handling ambiguous timestamps correctly. Additionally, we replaced the usage of `lib.generate_bins_dt64` with `pd.api.types.generate_bins_dt64` for consistency and best practices.
