The error message indicates that there is an ambiguous time issue when inferring dst time from "2018-11-04 00:00:00". This suggests that the bug is likely related to the handling of daylight saving time transitions.

The bug is likely occurring in the `_get_time_bins` function which involves operations with time indices and time frequencies. The issue might be caused by an incorrect handling of daylight saving time transitions or ambiguity in time zone conversions.

To fix the bug, it's important to ensure that the time zone conversions and adjustments for daylight saving time transitions are handled correctly, especially when determining the frequency of time bins.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
from pandas.core.resample import date_range
from pandas import DatetimeIndex, Timestamp, lib, NaT, Series
from pandas.core.api import DataFrame
from pandas.tseries.frequencies import Day
from datetime import datetime

class TimeGrouper:
    # ... other methods ...

    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )

        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, Series([], dtype='int64'), labels

        freq = ax.freq or self.freq
        binner = labels = date_range(
            start=ax.min(),
            end=ax.max(),
            freq=freq,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )

        unique_dates = binner.normalize().unique()
        bins_values = [(ax >= date).sum() for date in unique_dates]
        bins = Series(bins_values, index=unique_dates)

        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]

        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

        # if we end up with more labels than bins, adjust the labels
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[:len(bins)]

        return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code, the frequency is obtained directly from the input `ax`, and the bins are calculated based on the number of occurrences of each unique date. The logic for handling the offset in bins has been adjusted to ensure correct alignment. Additionally, there is improved handling of time zone conversions and daylight saving time adjustments.
