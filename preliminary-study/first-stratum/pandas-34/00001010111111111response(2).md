The bug seems to be occurring in the `_get_time_bins` method of the `TimeGrouper` class. When grouping the data by day frequency using `pd.Grouper(freq="1D")`, an `AmbiguousTimeError` is raised due to the ambiguous timestamp created by the clock change on November 4, 2018, at midnight local time in Cuba.

To fix this bug, you can modify the `_get_time_bins` method to handle ambiguous timestamps by using the `infer_day_time` argument in the `date_range` function. This allows pandas to infer the time associated with ambiguous timestamps when creating the date range.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` method in the `TimeGrouper` class:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    # ... (previous code)

    # Use infer_day_time to handle ambiguous timestamps
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        infer_day_time=True  # Add this argument to handle ambiguous timestamps
    )

    # ... (remaining code)
```

By adding the `infer_day_time=True` argument in the `date_range` function, the method will handle ambiguous timestamps during the date range creation process.

This change allows the `groupby` operation to properly handle the ambiguous timestamp and avoid the `AmbiguousTimeError` when grouping by day frequency.

After making this change, the `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` test case should run without raising an `AmbiguousTimeError`.
