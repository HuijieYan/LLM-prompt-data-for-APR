The error occurs when the `groupby` function is called on a DataFrame with a daily frequency, causing an AmbiguousTimeError. This happens because on a long clock-change day in Cuba, midnight local time becomes an ambiguous timestamp.

The bug is likely located in the `_get_time_bins` function of the `TimeGrouper` class, specifically in the calculation of the bin edges. The function doesn't handle the ambiguous time issue caused by the clock change.

To fix the bug, the `_get_time_bins` function needs to be updated to handle ambiguous times when computing the bin edges. This can be done by taking into account the non-constant time offset due to the clock change and identifying and labeling ambiguous times correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Calculate the bin edges, considering the ambiguous times
    first = ax[0].floor('D')  # Adjust for ambiguous times
    last = ax[-1].ceil('D')  # Adjust for ambiguous times

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, _ = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Calculate the bins using the adjusted bin edges
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, binner.asi8, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    # Handle labels for 'right' and 'hasnans' cases
    # ...

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With these changes, the `_get_time_bins` function should handle the ambiguous time issue correctly and avoid the AmbiguousTimeError.
