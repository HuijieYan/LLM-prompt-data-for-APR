The error in the function `cli_bool_option` is due to the assertion on line 5 (`assert isinstance(param, bool)`). This assertion expects the `param` to be of type `bool`, but it is actually of type `str`.

The buggy function assumes that the `param` will always be of type `bool`, but in reality, it is obtained from the `params` dictionary, where its type is `str`. This causes the assertion to fail and leads to the error.

To fix this bug, we need to update the function to handle the case where `param` is of type `str`. We can modify the function to compare the value of `param` with the true_value and false_value to decide the output. We should also remove the assertion as it is not necessary for the function to work correctly.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def cli_bool_option(params, command_option, param, true_value='true', false_value='false', separator=None):
    param_value = params.get(param)
    if param_value is not None:  # Check if the param exists in the dictionary
        if separator:
            return [command_option + separator + (true_value if param_value == 'true' else false_value)]
        return [command_option, true_value if param_value == 'true' else false_value]
    else:
        return []
```

With this corrected function, the test case should pass without any assertion errors.
