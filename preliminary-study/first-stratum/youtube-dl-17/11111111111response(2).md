1. The test case calls the `cli_bool_option` function with different parameters and checks if the returned value matches the expected value. The error message shows that the `param` variable is None when it should be a boolean value.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `param = params.get(param)`. If the `param` key is not found in the `params` dictionary, it will return None, which is causing the issue.

3. The bug occurs because the `cli_bool_option` function assumes that the `param` key will always be present in the `params` dictionary and will have a boolean value. However, when the `param` key is not present, it results in `param` being assigned the value of None, leading to the assertion error when it tries to check if `param` is a boolean.

4. One possible approach for fixing the bug is to handle the case where the `param` key is not present in the `params` dictionary. If the key is not present, we can assume it to be False and proceed accordingly.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `cli_bool_option` function:

```python
def cli_bool_option(params, command_option, param, true_value='true', false_value='false', separator=None):
    param = params.get(param, False)  # Assign False if param is not present in params
    assert isinstance(param, bool)
    if separator:
        return [command_option + separator + (true_value if param else false_value)]
    return [command_option, true_value if param else false_value]
```
