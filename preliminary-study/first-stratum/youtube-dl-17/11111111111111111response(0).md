The error message indicates that the `assert isinstance(param, bool)` statement is failing, suggesting that the `param` variable is not of type bool as expected.

The issue arises because the `param` variable is retrieved from the `params` dictionary using the `get` method. In Python, the `get` method returns None if the key is not found in the dictionary. This is likely causing the `param` variable to be of type None instead of bool in certain cases.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the key is not found in the dictionary. We can use the `get` method with a default value and then check if the retrieved value is a bool. If it is not, we can set it to a default value, such as False.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def cli_bool_option(params, command_option, param, true_value='true', false_value='false', separator=None):
    param = params.get(param, False)  # Use False as the default value if param is not found
    if not isinstance(param, bool):
        param = False  # Set param to False if it is not a bool
    if separator:
        return [command_option + separator + (true_value if param else false_value)]
    return [command_option, true_value if param else false_value]
```

By using the default value of False and explicitly checking and setting the type of `param`, we can ensure that the function works as expected and does not encounter the AssertionError mentioned in the error message.
