The bug in the `cli_bool_option` function seems to be due to the `assert` statement checking if the value of `param` is an instance of a boolean. The input parameter `param` is obtained from the `params` dictionary, and it may not always be a boolean. The assertion error occurs because when `param` is not present in the `params` dictionary, it is set to `None`, and `None` is not an instance of boolean.

To fix this bug, the `assert` statement should be removed because the `param` variable can be of any type, not just boolean. Instead of asserting the type, it would be better to handle the case where `param` is `None` by assigning it a default boolean value, like `False`.

Here's the corrected code for the `cli_bool_option` function:

```python
def cli_bool_option(params, command_option, param, true_value='true', false_value='false', separator=None):
    param = params.get(param)
    if param is None:
        param = False  # Assign a default boolean value if param is not present in params
    if separator:
        return [command_option + separator + (true_value if param else false_value)]
    return [command_option, true_value if param else false_value]
```

With this correction, the `cli_bool_option` function should handle cases where `param` is `None` and ensure that it is assigned a default boolean value.

The test cases for the `cli_bool_option` function can be run again to verify that the corrected function works as expected and does not raise any assertion errors.
