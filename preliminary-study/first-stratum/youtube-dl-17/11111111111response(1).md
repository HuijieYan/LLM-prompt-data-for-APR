1. The test case `test_cli_bool_option` is attempting to test the `cli_bool_option` function with various input parameters and options. The error message indicates that the function is failing an assertion related to the `param` variable not being a boolean. This suggests that the function is not handling the input parameters correctly.

2. The potential error location within the `cli_bool_option` function is where the `param` variable is being retrieved from the `params` dictionary and the assertion for its type (`bool`) is being performed.

3. The bug is occurring because the function assumes that the `param` value retrieved from the `params` dictionary is a boolean, but it does not account for cases where the value may be missing or of a different type. This leads to the assertion failure and the bug.

4. To fix the bug, the function should check if the `param` value is present in the `params` dictionary and if it is of the correct type (bool). If not, appropriate actions should be taken to handle these cases gracefully.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `cli_bool_option` function:
```python
def cli_bool_option(params, command_option, param, true_value='true', false_value='false', separator=None):
    param = params.get(param)
    if param is not None and isinstance(param, bool):
        if separator:
            return [command_option + separator + (true_value if param else false_value)]
        return [command_option, true_value if param else false_value]
    else:
        return []
```
In the corrected function, we added a check to ensure that the `param` value is not `None` and is also a boolean before proceeding with the logic to construct the return value. If the `param` is not of the correct type or is missing, the function returns an empty list as per the last assertion in the test.
