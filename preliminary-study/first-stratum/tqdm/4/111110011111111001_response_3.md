The error occurs in the function `format_meter` at the line `total *= unit_scale`. The error message indicates that it is attempting to perform a multiplication operation between a `NoneType` and an `int`, which is causing a `TypeError`.

The bug occurs because the `total` variable was assigned the value `None` in the earlier part of the function. This makes the subsequent multiplication operation `total *= unit_scale` invalid due to the `None` value.

To fix this bug, we should use a different variable to store the result of performing the multiplication operation, rather than trying to modify the `total` variable directly. Then, update the `total` variable with the new value.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    # ... (rest of the function's code)

    # sanity check: total
    if total and n > total:
        total = None

    # apply custom scale if necessary
    if unit_scale and unit_scale not in (True, 1):
        new_total = total * unit_scale
        total = new_total
        n *= unit_scale
        if rate:
            rate *= unit_scale  # by default rate = 1 / self.avg_time
        unit_scale = False

    # ... (rest of the function's code)

    return out
```

In the corrected code, we store the result of the multiplication operation in the `new_total` variable. Then we update the `total` variable with the new value `new_total`. This change fixes the bug and ensures that the multiplication operation is performed on valid values.
