The potential error in the given code is that the `format_meter` function is missing the `self` parameter in its signature to indicate that it's a method of the class.

The reason for the bug is that in Python, instance methods (functions declared within a class) must always include the `self` parameter as the first parameter to refer to the instance of the class.

To fix the bug, the `format_meter` function should include the `self` parameter as the first parameter in its signature, indicating that it is a method of the class.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_meter` function:

```python
def format_meter(self, n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    # ...rest of the function implementation...
```
