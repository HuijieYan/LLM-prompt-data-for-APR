Potential error location: The error seems to be related to the function signature of `format_meter`. There are some missing parameters and misplaced comments in the parameter section of the function which might be causing the confusion.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The error occurred because the function signature is incomplete and has misplaced comments, making it difficult to understand the parameters the function expects.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Correct the function signature by removing misplaced comments and adding missing parameters.
2. Ensure that the function documentation is clear and accurately describes the purpose of each parameter.

Corrected code:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    
    # The rest of the function code remains the same
```
This corrected code provides a clear and complete function signature, accurately representing the parameters the function is expecting.
