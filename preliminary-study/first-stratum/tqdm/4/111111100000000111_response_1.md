The potential error location within the problematic function is at the very beginning where the function signature is defined. There are several missing parameters in the function signature which are causing the function to throw a syntax error.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug are missing or incorrectly defined parameters in the function signature, and also indentation issues.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the function signature by adding the missing parameters and fixing the indentation issues.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def format_meter(self, n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False, unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    # function implementation
```
