The error message indicates a TypeError occurring on the line `total *= unit_scale` within the `format_meter` function. The error occurs because the variable `total` is being checked for truthiness rather than being explicitly checked for None or having a default value of 0. When `total` is None, the multiplication operation cannot be performed and results in the TypeError.

To fix this bug, we can add a check to handle the case when `total` is None. If `total` is None, it can be replaced with 0 before performing any arithmetic operations.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_meter` function:

```python
    @staticmethod
    def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                     unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                     postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
        """
        Return a string-based progress bar given some parameters
    
        Parameters
        ----------
        ...
        """

        # handle the case when total is None
        if total is None:
            total = 0

        # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With this modification, the bug causing the TypeError should be fixed, and the function should work as intended. The check for None in the `total` variable prevents the TypeError from occurring when performing arithmetic operations.
