The error occurs in the "format_meter" method of the "tqdm" class. The error message indicates that the "total" variable is of type "NoneType," which causes a TypeError when trying to multiply it by "unit_scale."

The potential error location is within the "apply custom scale if necessary" section of the code, where "total *= unit_scale" is causing the TypeError due to the "total" variable being None.

To fix this bug, we need to check if "total" is not None before applying the custom scale. If "total" is None, we should skip the custom scale calculation.

Here's the corrected code for the "format_meter" function:

```python
    @staticmethod
    def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                     unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                     postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
        """
        Return a string-based progress bar given some parameters
        
        ... (parameters and docstring remain the same) ...
        """
        
        # sanity check: total
        if total is not None and n > total:
            total = None

        # apply custom scale if necessary
        if total is not None and unit_scale and unit_scale not in (True, 1):
            total *= unit_scale
            n *= unit_scale
            if rate:
                rate *= unit_scale  # by default rate = 1 / self.avg_time
            unit_scale = False
        
        # ... (rest of the function remains the same) ...
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to ensure that "total" is not None before applying the custom scale. If "total" is None, the custom scale calculations are skipped.
