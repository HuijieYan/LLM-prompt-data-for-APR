The error is occurring in the `format_meter` function of the `tqdm` class. The error is specifically happening in the part of the code where the `unit_scale` is being applied to the `total`. This is leading to a `TypeError` because the `total` is being set to `None`, and you cannot multiply `None` with an integer.

The potential bug location is:
```python
# apply custom scale if necessary
if unit_scale and unit_scale not in (True, 1):
    total *= unit_scale
```

To fix this bug, the code needs to handle the case where `total` is `None` before applying any operations on it.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_meter` function:

```python
    @staticmethod
    def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                     unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                     postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
        """
        Return a string-based progress bar given some parameters

        Parameters
        ----------
        ... # rest of the parameters remain the same

        Returns
        -------
        out  : Formatted meter and stats, ready to display.
        """

        # sanity check: total
        if total and n > total:
            total = None

        # apply custom scale if necessary
        if unit_scale and unit_scale not in (True, 1) and total is not None:  # check if total is not None
            total *= unit_scale

        # rest of the function remains the same
```

By adding the condition `total is not None` before applying the `unit_scale`, the code will avoid trying to multiply `None` with an integer, which was causing the `TypeError`.
