The potential error location within the problematic function is in the section where the `total` variable is being modified based on the `unit_scale`. The error occurs because if the `total` is `None`, you cannot perform the operation `total *= unit_scale` as shown in the error message.

The error occurs because the original code does not have proper handling for the case where `total` is None before performing the operation. 

To fix the bug, you can modify the function to include a check for `total` being `None` before performing the operation `total *= unit_scale`. If `total` is not None, then the scaling calculation can take place.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    if total and n > total:
        total = None

    # only apply custom scale if total is not None
    if total and unit_scale and unit_scale not in (True, 1):
        total *= unit_scale
        n *= unit_scale
        if rate:
            rate *= unit_scale  # by default rate = 1 / self.avg_time
        unit_scale = False

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
}
```

By adding the condition `if total` before applying the custom scale to `total`, this will ensure that only when `total` is not None will the scaling operation be performed, avoiding the TypeError mentioned in the error message.
