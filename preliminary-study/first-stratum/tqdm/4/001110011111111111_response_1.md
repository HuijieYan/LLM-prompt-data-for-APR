The error occurs when the `total` is None and the `unit_scale` is not equal to 1 or True. This causes an attempt to multiply `total` by `unit_scale` which is not allowed due to the None type.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `total` is not None before attempting to apply custom scale. If `total` is None, then we can skip the custom scale application and proceed with other calculations.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@staticmethod
    def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                     unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                     postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
        """
        Return a string-based progress bar given some parameters
        ... (rest of the docstring remains the same) ...
        """
        if total is not None:  # Check if total is not None before applying custom scale
            # apply custom scale if necessary
            if unit_scale and unit_scale not in (True, 1):
                total *= unit_scale
                n *= unit_scale
                if rate:
                    rate *= unit_scale  # by default rate = 1 / self.avg_time
                unit_scale = False
    
        # rest of the function remains unchanged
        ...
```

With this change, we have added a check to ensure that the custom scale is only applied when `total` is not None. If `total` is None, then the custom scale is skipped, and the function proceeds with other calculations.
