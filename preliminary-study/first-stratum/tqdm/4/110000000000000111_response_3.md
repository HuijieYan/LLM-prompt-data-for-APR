Potential error location: The `@staticmethod` decorator without a class definition suggests that this function is meant to be part of a class but is improperly defined as a standalone function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The use of the `@staticmethod` decorator without a proper class definition will result in an error because it is expecting the function to be part of a class.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Define a class and move the function inside the class. Then use the `@staticmethod` decorator to define the function as a static method of the class.

Corrected code:
```python
class ProgressBar:
    @staticmethod
    def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                     unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                     postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
        """
        Return a string-based progress bar given some parameters
        (same documentation as before, just moved into the class)
        """
        # Same function body as before
```
