The potential error in the code is due to the incorrect usage of class and static methods. The `format_meter` method is a static method, so it should not access the instance attributes or methods directly. Additionally, the use of `self` within the `format_dict` method suggests that it should have been an instance method rather than a static method.

The bug occurs because the `format_meter` static method tries to access instance attributes and methods directly, violating the static method's behavior. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential errors.

To fix the bug, the usage of `self` within the `format_meter` method should be removed, and the `format_dict` method should be converted to an instance method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class tqdm(Comparable):
    """
    Decorate an iterable object, returning an iterator which acts exactly
    like the original iterable, but prints a dynamically updating
    progressbar every time a value is requested.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    @staticmethod
    def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                     unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                     postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
        # ... omitted code ...

    @staticmethod
    def format_sizeof(num, suffix='', divisor=1000):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    @staticmethod
    def format_interval(t):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def format_dict(self):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass
```

By making the `format_meter` method a static method and removing the usage of `self`, we can ensure that the method behaves correctly and does not attempt to access instance attributes or methods. Additionally, by converting the `format_dict` method to an instance method, we can ensure that it can access instance attributes and methods if necessary.
