The error occurs when the function tries to multiply the 'total' value by the 'unit_scale'. The error message indicates that the 'total' value is of type 'NoneType', which cannot be multiplied by an integer. This is likely due to the 'total' value not being set correctly when 'total' is meaningful.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the 'total' value is always initialized properly and that the multiplication is only performed when 'total' has a valid value.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    """
    Return a string-based progress bar given some parameters
    """

    # Set total to None when it's meaningless
    if total and n > total:
        total = None

    # apply custom scale if necessary and total is not None
    if total and unit_scale and unit_scale not in (True, 1):
        total *= unit_scale
        n *= unit_scale
        if rate:
            rate *= unit_scale

    # Remaining code remains the same

    return formatted_meter_and_stats  # replace with actual return statement
```

In the corrected function, we first set 'total' to None when it's meaningless. Then, we only perform the multiplication if 'total' has a valid value and 'unit_scale' is set.

This modification ensures that the 'total' value is properly handled and the multiplication is performed only when 'total' is meaningful.
