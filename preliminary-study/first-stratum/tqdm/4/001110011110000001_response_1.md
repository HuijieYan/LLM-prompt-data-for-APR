The error message indicates that there is a TypeError occurring on line 323 in the `format_meter` function. Specifically, the issue is with the line `total *= unit_scale`. This means that the `total` variable is of type `NoneType` and we are trying to perform multiplication on it, which is not allowed.

The reason for this bug is that the `total` variable becomes `None` when the `if total and n > total` condition is met. As a result, in some scenarios, `total` could end up being `None`, leading to the TypeError when trying to perform the multiplication operation with `unit_scale`.

To fix this bug, we should handle the `None` value for `total` before performing any operations related to it. One approach could be to check if `total` is not None before attempting any calculations involving it.

Here is the corrected `format_meter` function:

```python
    @staticmethod
    def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                     unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                     postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
        """
        Return a string-based progress bar given some parameters
    
        ... (rest of the docstring remains the same) ...
        """

        # sanity check: total
        if total and n > total:
            total = None
        elif total:  # Handle None value for total
            if unit_scale and unit_scale not in (True, 1):
                total *= unit_scale
                n *= unit_scale
                if rate:
                    rate *= unit_scale  # by default rate = 1 / self.avg_time
                unit_scale = False

        # rest of the function remains the same
```

In the corrected code, after the initial check for `total` being None, an additional check is performed to handle the None value for `total` before any further calculations involving it. This should resolve the issue and prevent the TypeError when `total` is None.
