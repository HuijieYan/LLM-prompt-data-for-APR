The bug is caused by the incorrect calculation of the rate and total_fmt when the unit_scale is set to 10. This results in incorrect units of measurement and formatting issues in the output. 

To fix this bug, you can modify the code so that the calculation of rate and total_fmt takes into account the unit_scale value properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_meter` method:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    """
    Return a string-based progress bar given some parameters
    """

    # sanity check: total
    if total and n > total:
        total = None

    # apply custom scale if necessary
    if unit_scale and unit_scale not in (True, 1):
        if total:
            total *= unit_scale
        n *= unit_scale
        if rate:
            rate *= unit_scale  # by default rate = 1 / self.avg_time
        unit_scale = False

    # remaining code, calculations and formatting as-is

    return l_bar + full_bar + r_bar
```

In this corrected code, the calculation of 'rate' and 'total_fmt' considers the 'unit_scale' value properly. This will ensure that the correct units of measurement and formatting are used in the progress bar's output.
