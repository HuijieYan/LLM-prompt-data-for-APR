The error message indicates a TypeError occurring on line 323 of the `tqdm` class in the `format_meter` method. The error is due to trying to perform the operation `total *= unit_scale` where `total` is a NoneType and `unit_scale` is an integer.

The potential error location is the line `total *= unit_scale` within the `format_meter` method.

The reason behind this bug is that if `unit_scale` is provided as an integer, the code intends to scale the `total` by multiplying it with `unit_scale`. However, if `total` is None, this operation will result in a TypeError.

To fix this bug, a check needs to be added to ensure that `total` is not None before attempting to scale it by `unit_scale`.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_meter` method:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    """
    Return a string-based progress bar given some parameters

    (Previous function content remains the same)

    Parameters
    ----------
    (Previous parameter list remains the same)

    Returns
    -------
    out  : Formatted meter and stats, ready to display.
    """
    if total is not None:  # Add check to ensure total is not None
        # sanity check: total
        if total and n > total:
            total = None

        # apply custom scale if necessary
        if unit_scale and unit_scale not in (True, 1):
            total *= unit_scale  # Scale total
            n *= unit_scale
            if rate:
                rate *= unit_scale  # by default rate = 1 / self.avg_time
            unit_scale = False

    (Remaining function content remains the same)
```
