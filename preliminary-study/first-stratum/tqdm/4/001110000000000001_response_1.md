The error in the `format_meter` function is that it is missing the `self` parameter, which is required since the function is within a class.

The error occurs because the `format_meter` function is supposed to be an instance method, but it is defined without the `self` parameter, which is necessary for instance methods in Python.

To fix the bug, the `format_meter` function should be defined with the `self` parameter, making it an instance method of the `tqdm` class.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_meter` function:
```python
def format_meter(self, n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    # rest of the code remains unchanged
```
