The potential error in the provided function is that it contains a syntax error in the method signature. The syntax error is present in the `format_meter` method where the method signature is not closed properly.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is due to the incorrect method signature, which causes a syntax error when the code is executed.

To fix the bug, the method signature for `format_meter` should be corrected by properly closing the method signature with a closing parenthesis after the `ascii=False` parameter.

```python
# Corrected and updated function
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                  unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                  postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    # remaining code remains the same
```
