The error in the given code is due to the incorrect function signature for the `format_meter` function. The function signature is not closed properly and is missing the closing parenthesis and a colon. Additionally, the `unit` parameter is not included in the function signature.

The bug occurred because the function signature was not properly closed, and the `unit` parameter was missing, causing a syntax error in Python.

To fix the bug, the function signature for `format_meter` should be properly closed and the `unit` parameter should be included in the function signature.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_meter` function:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                     unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                     postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
```
