# buggy function docstring

```text
Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

# Arguments
    x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
    data_format: Data format of the image array.
    mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
        - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
            then will zero-center each color channel with
            respect to the ImageNet dataset,
            without scaling.
        - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
            sample-wise.
        - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
            will normalize each channel with respect to the
            ImageNet dataset.

# Returns
    Preprocessed Numpy array.
