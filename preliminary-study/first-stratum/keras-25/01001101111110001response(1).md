The error message indicates that there is an issue with casting the output of a subtraction operation from dtype('float64') to dtype('int32').

In the function "_preprocess_numpy_input", there are multiple operations that involve division and subtraction on the input array "x". These operations can lead to the output having a different data type than the input, which might cause issues when the input is of type 'int32'.

One possible approach to fix this bug is to ensure that the output maintains the same data type as the input. This can be achieved by explicitly casting the output to the same data type as the input.

Here's the corrected code for the "_preprocess_numpy_input" function:

```python
import numpy as np

# this is the corrected function
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """
    Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.
    
    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.
