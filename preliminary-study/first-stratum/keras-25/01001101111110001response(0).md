The error message indicates that there is an issue with casting the output of the subtraction operation from `float64` to `int32`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is when the input `x` is of type `int32` and the preprocessing involves mathematical operations that result in `float64` values.

The bug occurs because the function assumes that the input `x` will always be of type `float` and doesn't handle cases where it might be of type `int`.

To fix the bug, we can explicitly cast the input `x` to `float64` before performing any mathematical operations. This will ensure that the output is also of type `float64` and can be cast to `int32` if needed.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """
    Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.
    ...
    """

    x = x.astype('float64')
