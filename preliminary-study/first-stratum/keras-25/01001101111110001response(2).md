The error message indicates an issue with casting from float to int32 when using the `subtract` ufunc. This suggests that the input data type is being processed incorrectly within the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function. The function is supposed to handle different data formats and modes for image preprocessing, but it seems that the processing for different modes is not properly implemented.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle the 'caffe' mode properly. It is missing the necessary operations for converting RGB to BGR and zero-centering each color channel with respect to the ImageNet dataset without scaling.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to add the missing preprocessing operations for the 'caffe' mode and ensure that the data format is handled correctly based on the provided input.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """
    Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """

    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x = np.transpose(x, (0, 3, 1, 2))
        # scale, then normalize
        x = (x - mean) / std
    elif mode == 'caffe':
        x = x[..., ::-1]  # RGB to BGR
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x = np.transpose(x, (0, 3, 1, 2))
        x -= mean
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid mode. Supported modes are 'tf', 'torch', and 'caffe'.")

    return x
```

In the corrected version, the 'caffe' mode now correctly handles the RGB to BGR conversion and zero-centering without scaling. Also, for the 'torch' mode, the scaling and normalization are performed as per the ImageNet dataset. If the data format is 'channels_first', the function correctly transposes the input array. Additionally, the function raises a ValueError for an invalid mode.
