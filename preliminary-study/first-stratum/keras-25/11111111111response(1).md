1. The test case is trying to check if the `utils.preprocess_input(xint)` returns an array with the same shape as `xint`. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the subtraction operation, specifically related to the data types involved.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the part where the subtraction operation is being performed.

3. The bug occurs because the input array `x` is being converted to another data type (in this case, it's being converted to integer using `xint = x.astype('int32')`). Then, when performing the subtraction operation with the `mean` array (which has a data type of float), the data types are incompatible, leading to the error.

4. To fix the bug, the input array `x` should be converted back to the original data type before performing any arithmetic operations on it. This will ensure that the data types of the arrays involved in the operations are compatible.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    # Convert x to float if it's not already in float format
    if x.dtype != 'float32':
        x = x.astype('float32')

    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
