The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the handling of the `mode` variable. If the `mode` is neither 'tf' nor 'torch', the function attempts to use the `data_format` variable to perform operations. However, the `mean` and `std` variables are not defined in this case, causing the script to error out.

To fix this bug, we can define the `mean` and `std` variables for the case where the `mode` is neither 'tf' nor 'torch'. Additionally, the code to perform the operations based on the `data_format` can be modified to make sure the operations are performed correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]  # Define mean and std for the case when mode is neither 'tf' nor 'torch'
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
            x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
            x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        x[..., 0] /= std[0]
        x[..., 1] /= std[1]
        x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
```

This corrected code should handle the various modes and data formats properly and avoid the issues present in the original function.
