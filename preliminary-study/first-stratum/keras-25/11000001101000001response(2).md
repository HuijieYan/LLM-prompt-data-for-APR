The potential error in the provided function `preprocess_numpy_input` is the absence of a return statement for the case when `mode` is neither 'tf' nor 'torch' and `data_format` is 'channels_first'. In this case, the function should process the input, but it currently does not return any value.

The bug occurs due to the lack of a return statement for the specified condition. The function needs to return the processed input for this condition to ensure the function behaves correctly for all possible inputs.

To fix the bug, we need to add a return statement for the condition where `mode` is neither 'tf' nor 'torch' and `data_format` is 'channels_first'. Additionally, we should set the default values for `mean` and `std` in that case.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        # Rest of the code remains the same
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
            std = None
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
            mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
            std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
``` 

The corrected function now includes a return statement for the condition where `mode` is neither 'tf' nor 'torch' and `data_format` is 'channels_first'. Additionally, default values for `mean` and `std` are set in this case to ensure the function returns a processed input for all possible inputs.
