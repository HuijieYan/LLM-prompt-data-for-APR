The error message indicates that the function `is_monotonic_increasing` is trying to access an attribute of a `NoneType` object, which leads to an `AttributeError`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the `_engine` method, as it seems to be returning a reference to `self._engine_type`, which may not be properly initialized. This could lead to `self._engine_type` being None when it is accessed later.

The bug is likely occurring due to the weak reference not being maintained properly, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `NoneType` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, one approach could be to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained throughout the lifetime of the `PeriodEngine` instance. This may involve modifying the implementation of the weak reference or ensuring that the `PeriodIndex` instance is not garbage collected while the `PeriodEngine` is still using it.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` method that attempts to address this issue:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

In this corrected code, a weak reference to `self` is stored in the `period_ref` variable, and it is passed to the `_engine_type` constructor to ensure that a valid reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance is maintained.

This change should help prevent the `NoneType` error from occurring when the `PeriodEngine` attempts to access the `PeriodIndex` instance.
