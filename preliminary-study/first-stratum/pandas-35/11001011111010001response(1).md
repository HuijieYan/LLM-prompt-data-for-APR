The error message 'AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'' suggests that the function `_engine` is returning `None` instead of the expected output which leads to the AttributeError when `view` method is called on `None` type.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `return` statement in the `_engine` function.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely due to the fact that the `_engine` method is not returning the expected output, possibly due to a missing or incorrect implementation.

To fix the bug, the return statement in the `_engine` function should return the expected output or object, based on the input parameters and the operations performed inside the function.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))  # Return the expected output
```
By returning the `_engine_type` with the appropriate parameters, the function should now return the expected output instead of `None`, resolving the AttributeError.
