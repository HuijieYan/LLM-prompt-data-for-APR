1. The test case is checking if all the levels in the `idx2` object are monotonic, which involves calling the `is_monotonic` property on each level of `idx2.levels`. The error message indicates that it is failing when trying to access the `is_monotonic_increasing` attribute, which suggests that the `PeriodEngine` is not functioning as expected.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the `_engine` method. It seems that the `self._engine_type` is not returning the expected `PeriodEngine` object as the engine, which leads to the AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute.

3. The bug occurs because the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object is being dropped before it should be, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

4. To fix the bug, it's necessary to ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object is maintained until it is no longer needed by the `PeriodEngine`. This can be achieved by modifying the way the weak reference is handled and ensuring that the `PeriodIndex` object is still accessible when the `PeriodEngine` is being used.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# import the necessary module
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    def wrapper(self):
        if not hasattr(self, '_cached_engine'):
            # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
            period = weakref.ref(self)
            self._cached_engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
        return self._cached_engine
    return wrapper
```
