Potential error location:
The potential error location is in the _engine function, where it returns a call to self._engine_type, passing weakref.ref(self) and len(self) as arguments.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug is likely occurring because the weakref.ref() function returns a weak reference to the object, and that weak reference is being used as a parameter to self._engine_type. This may be causing issues with the function call.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
One approach to fixing this bug is to ensure that the correct parameters are being passed to self._engine_type. Additionally, if the weak reference is causing issues, it may need to be handled differently or avoided altogether.

Corrected code:
```python
import weakref

# file name: /Users/jerry/.abw/BugsInPy_Dir/BugsInPy_Cloned_Repos/pandas/pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self._values, len(self))

```
