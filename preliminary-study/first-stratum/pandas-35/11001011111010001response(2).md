The error message 'AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'' indicates that the buggy function is returning a NoneType object instead of the expected type. This means that the function is not returning the correct value, leading to an AttributeError when trying to access the 'view' attribute.

The potential error location within the function is the return statement:
```python
return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is returning None instead of the expected type, which leads to the AttributeError in the test function.

To fix the bug, the function should return the correct type, which in this case is a PeriodEngine object. 

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from weakref import ref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._values))
```

In this corrected code, the weakref is properly used and the correct attribute, 'self._values', is used to obtain the length of the values for the function to return the correct type.
