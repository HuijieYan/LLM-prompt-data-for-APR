The error message 'AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'' indicates that the function is returning None instead of the expected type of object. This is likely because the weak reference to 'self' is not being properly handled, resulting in a None value being returned.

To fix this issue, the weak reference to 'self' should be properly handled to avoid a reference cycle, which is causing the function to return None.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type()(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected code, the weak reference to 'self' is properly handled to avoid the reference cycle, and the _engine_type() is called with proper arguments to return the expected type of object instead of None.
