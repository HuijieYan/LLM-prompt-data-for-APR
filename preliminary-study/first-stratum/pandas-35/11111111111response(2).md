1. The test case creates a MultiIndex with period values, then copies the levels using _get_level_values() and checks if the levels are monotonic. The error message indicates that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is dropped before intended, leading to a NoneType error.

2. The potential error location is within the _engine() method of the PeriodIndex class.

3. The bug occurs because the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is not being properly handled, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the expected PeriodIndex.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is properly maintained and utilized within the _engine() method.

5. Here's the corrected code for the _engine() method of the PeriodIndex class:

```python
from weakref import ref

class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    # ... omitted code ...

    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To properly maintain the weak reference, we use the ref() function from the weakref module
        period = ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
In this corrected code, the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is properly maintained using the ref() function from the weakref module. This ensures that the PeriodEngine receives the expected PeriodIndex and resolves the NoneType error.
