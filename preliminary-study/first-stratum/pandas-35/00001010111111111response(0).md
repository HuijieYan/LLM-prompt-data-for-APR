1. The test case `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a MultiIndex from a PeriodIndex and then tries to check if all the levels are monotonic. However, it raises an error with the message 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'. This indicates that there is an issue with the PeriodEngine for the PeriodIndex.

2. The potential error location is in the `_engine` function where it tries to use the weakref of self to create a PeriodEngine.

3. The bug occurs because the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is being dropped before it is intended to, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is maintained throughout the execution of the `_engine` function so that it is not prematurely dropped.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
from functools import lru_cache
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    cached_property = lru_cache()(func)
    def get(self):
        if not hasattr(self, '_cache'):
            self._cache = {}
        if func.__name__ not in self._cache:
            self._cache[func.__name__] = cached_property(self)
        return self._cache[func.__name__]
    return property(get)

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This fixed code maintains a weak reference to the PeriodIndex throughout the execution of the `_engine` function, ensuring that it is not prematurely dropped.
