The error message indicates that the PeriodEngine is getting a None instead of the PeriodIndex, leading to an AttributeError. This suggests that the issue occurs in the _engine method, where the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is being dropped before it should be.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained throughout the _engine method.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    def wrapper(self):
        if not hasattr(self, '_engine'):
            self._engine = func(self)
        return self._engine
    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In this corrected function, we maintain the weak reference to self throughout the _engine method, ensuring that it is not dropped prematurely. This should resolve the issue described in the bug report.
