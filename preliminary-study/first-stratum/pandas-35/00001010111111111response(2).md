The error message indicates that there is an AttributeError occurring in the `PeriodEngine` class, specifically in the `vgetter().view("i8")` line.

The bug occurs due to the fact that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped prematurely, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `NoneType` object instead of the `PeriodIndex` that it expects.

To fix this bug, the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` should be properly maintained until the `PeriodEngine` has finished using it. This can be achieved by modifying the `_engine` method to correctly use `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`. Using `weakref.proxy` will allow the `PeriodIndex` to be garbage collected when no other references exist.

Additionally, the `len(self)` should be replaced with `len(self._values)` to ensure that the correct length is used when creating the `PeriodEngine`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(fn):
    def wrapped(self):
        if not hasattr(self, '_cache'):
            self._cache = {}
        if fn.__name__ not in self._cache:
            self._cache[fn.__name__] = fn(self)
        return self._cache[fn.__name__]
    return wrapped

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref.proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._values))
```
