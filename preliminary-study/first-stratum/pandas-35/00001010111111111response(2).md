The error occurs in the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class. The error message indicates that an AttributeError occurs because a weakly referenced PeriodIndex is dropped before intended, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving a NoneType instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, the weak reference to the `self` should be properly handled within the `_engine` method.

```python
import weakref

def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, the method will return a weak reference to `self` and avoid the issue of the weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped prematurely.

This fix should address the bug and resolve the AttributeError that was occurring in the test case.
