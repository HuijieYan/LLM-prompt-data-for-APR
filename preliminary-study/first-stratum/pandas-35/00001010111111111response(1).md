The error occurs in the `_engine` function due to the weak reference to `self` being assigned to `period` and then used to create `_engine_type`. However, the weak reference is not being properly maintained and is being dropped prematurely, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this issue, the weak reference to `self` needs to be properly maintained throughout the function. This can be achieved by storing the weak reference as an attribute of the function, ensuring that it remains alive until the function is done using it.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    def wrapper(self):
        if not hasattr(self, '_cached_engine'):
            self._cached_engine = weakref.ref(self)

        period = self._cached_engine()
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))

    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
```

The `cache_readonly` decorator now properly maintains a weak reference to `self` within the `_engine` function, ensuring that the reference does not get dropped prematurely. This should address the issue of the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.
