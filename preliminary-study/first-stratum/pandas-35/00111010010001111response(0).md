Potential error location:
The error occurs in the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug seems to be related to weak referencing of the `PeriodIndex` object within the `_engine` method. The weak reference is not maintained properly, leading to a `None` value being passed to the `PeriodEngine`. This causes an AttributeError when trying to access an attribute of a None object.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To address this issue, the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object needs to be maintained properly so that it is not dropped prematurely. This can be achieved by ensuring the weak reference is used correctly within the `_engine` method.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type(period, len(self))  # Ensure weak reference is used correctly
    return engine_type
```

In the corrected code, we ensure that the `period` weak reference is passed correctly to the `_engine_type` and use the resulting engine_type as the return value for the `_engine` method. This should resolve the issue related to weak referencing and prevent the AttributeError from occurring.
