It seems that the issue is related to the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class. The error message indicates that the `PeriodEngine` is receiving a `NoneType` object instead of a `PeriodIndex`.

The bug is likely occurring because the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is not being maintained properly, leading to it being garbage collected and resulting in the `NoneType` being passed to the `PeriodEngine`.

To fix this issue, the `PeriodIndex` instance needs to be properly maintained as a weak reference to ensure it is not garbage collected prematurely.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._values))
```

In this corrected code, `len(self._values)` is used instead of `len(self)` to ensure that the weak reference is maintained. Additionally, it's assumed that `self._values` is the attribute that holds the actual values of the `PeriodIndex`.

By making these changes, the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` should be maintained properly, and the issue with the `NoneType` being passed to the `PeriodEngine` should be resolved.
