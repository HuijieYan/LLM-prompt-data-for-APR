The analysis of the provided information shows that the bug may be located in the `_engine` function of the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file. The error message from the test function indicates an AttributeError related to the 'NoneType' object.

The potential error location within the `_engine` function is the `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))` line. It seems that the function is returning a `NoneType` object instead of the expected type.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be an issue with the instantiation of the engine type, which is not properly returning an instance of the expected type.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that the `_engine` function returns an instance of the `_engine_type` class. This can be achieved by properly instantiating the `_engine_type` and returning the instance.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from pandas.core.computation.cache import cache_readonly
import weakref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))()
```

By adding `()` after `len(self)` in the return statement, we are instantiating the `_engine_type` class and returning an instance of the expected type. This should address the bug and ensure that the `_engine` function returns the correct type.
