The error seems to be occurring in the `is_monotonic` property of the `MultiIndex` class, which ultimately calls the `PeriodEngine` class. The error message indicates that the `PeriodEngine` is receiving a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

The bug is occurring because the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is being dropped prematurely, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the actual `PeriodIndex` object.

To fix this bug, the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object needs to be maintained until the `PeriodEngine` has finished using it.

Here's the corrected function for the `_engine` method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Maintain a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type
    return engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By maintaining the weak reference to `self` until the `PeriodEngine` has finished using it, the bug should be fixed and the `PeriodEngine` should receive the actual `PeriodIndex` object instead of `None`.
