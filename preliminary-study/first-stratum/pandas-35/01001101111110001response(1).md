The error message "AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'" indicates that the function is returning a `NoneType` object instead of the expected type (`PeriodArray`).

The potential error location is within the `_engine` function where it returns a value.

The bug occurs because the `@cache_readonly` decorator is not properly implemented, leading to the function returning `None` instead of the expected value.

To fix the bug, the `@cache_readonly` decorator should be implemented correctly to cache the return value of the `_engine` function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from functools import lru_cache

# Corrected function source code
@lru_cache
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using the `@lru_cache` decorator from the `functools` module, the return value of the `_engine` function will be cached, and subsequent calls to the function with the same arguments will return the cached value instead of recalculating it.
