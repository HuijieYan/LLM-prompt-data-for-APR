1. The test case `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is attempting to create a MultiIndex from a PeriodIndex and then assert that all levels of the resulting MultiIndex are monotonic. The error message indicates that an AttributeError is raised when attempting to check if the levels are monotonic.

2. The potential error location is within the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class, as indicated by the error message referencing a 'NoneType' object.

3. The bug occurs because the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a NoneType object instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`, leading to the AttributeError when attempting to access the object's attributes.

4. To fix this bug, one approach is to modify the `_engine` method to ensure that the weak reference to `PeriodIndex` is maintained for as long as it is needed by the `PeriodEngine`. This can be achieved by modifying the caching or referencing mechanism used in the `_engine` method.

5. Corrected code for the `_engine` method:

```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))()
```

By adding the parentheses `()` after `len(self)`, the `PeriodEngine` will be called with the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex`, ensuring that it remains accessible for the duration needed by the engine. This should prevent the AttributeError from occurring.
