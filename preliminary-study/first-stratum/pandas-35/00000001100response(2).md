The corrected function can be as follows:

```python
from functools import cached_property

@cached_property
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This should resolve the issue and prevent the AttributeError.
