The error message "AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'" suggests that the `_engine` function is returning `None` instead of the expected type, leading to an AttributeError when the calling code tries to access an attribute of the returned object.

The potential error location is the return statement of the `_engine` function. It seems that the function `_engine_type` is not being called properly or is not returning the expected type.

The bug is likely occurring because the `_engine_type` method is not being called with the correct arguments, or it is not returning the expected type.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the `_engine_type` method is being called with the correct arguments and is returning the expected type.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
from functools import lru_cache

def cache_readonly(func):
    @property
    @lru_cache()
    def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
        return func(self, *args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._values))
```

In this corrected code, I've used the `lru_cache` decorator from the `functools` module to cache the result of the function call. This should ensure that the `_engine_type` method is being called with the correct arguments and returning the expected type.
