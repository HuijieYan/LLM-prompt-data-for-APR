The error message suggests that the function is returning a NoneType object, which leads to an AttributeError when attempting to access the `view` attribute. 

The potential error location within the function is the `@cache_readonly` decorator, which might not be properly implemented or defined. This decorator is not a standard Python decorator, so it might be a custom decorator for caching the return value of the `_engine` function.

The bug occurred because the decorator `@cache_readonly` is not functioning as expected, and it is not properly caching the return value of the `_engine` function.

To fix the bug, the use of `@cache_readonly` decorator needs to be replaced with the built-in `@property` decorator to make `_engine` a property method. Additionally, it's a good practice to use `@functools.lru_cache` for caching the return value.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import weakref
from functools import lru_cache

@property
@lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this corrected code, the `_engine` function is now a property method, and the return value is cached using the `lru_cache` decorator from the `functools` module.
