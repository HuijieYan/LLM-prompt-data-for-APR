1. The test case involves creating a MultiIndex from a PeriodIndex and then checking if all levels are monotonic. The error message indicates that the `is_monotonic` property is being accessed, which in turn uses the `_engine` method. The error message shows that an AttributeError is raised, indicating that the `_engine` method is returning a `NoneType` object.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the `_engine` method, where it returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.

3. The bug occurs because the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before the intended use, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This is likely leading to the `NoneType` object being returned, causing the AttributeError when the `is_monotonic` property is accessed.

4. To fix this bug, one possible approach is to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained until it is no longer needed. This can be achieved by modifying the caching mechanism or the handling of the weak reference.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    result = None
    def wrapper(self):
        nonlocal result
        if result is None:
            period = weakref.ref(self)
            result = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
        return result
    return wrapper
```
