The error message 'AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'' suggests that the function `_engine` is returning `None` instead of the expected result. This could be due to an issue with the implementation of the `_engine` function.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the return statement, where `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` should return a valid value, but it is currently returning `None`.

The bug is likely occurring because the `weakref.ref` is not being used correctly, resulting in the function returning `None` instead of the expected result.

To fix the bug, the usage of `weakref.ref` should be reviewed and potentially revised to ensure it is correctly capturing the reference to `self` for later use.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    def inner(self):
        if not hasattr(self, "_cached"):
            self._cached = {}
        if func.__name__ not in self._cached:
            self._cached[func.__name__] = func(self)
        return self._cached[func.__name__]
    return inner

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This corrected code includes a decorator `cache_readonly` that stores the result of the `_engine` function after it's first execution. It uses `weakref.proxy` to create a weak reference to `self` and avoids a reference cycle. This should fix the bug and ensure that the function `_engine` returns the expected result.
