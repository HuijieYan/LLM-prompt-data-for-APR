The bug in the given code is that the _engine function is using the wrong type for the input parameter 'period'. Instead of using weakref.ref, it should directly use self since the intention is to avoid reference cycles.

The reason for the bug is that weakref.ref creates a weak reference to the object, but the function _engine_type probably expects the original object.

To fix the bug, we should modify the _engine function to pass the original 'self' object instead of a weak reference.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import weakref  # assuming this import is present in the actual code

# file name: /Users/jerry/.abw/BugsInPy_Dir/BugsInPy_Cloned_Repos/pandas/pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
