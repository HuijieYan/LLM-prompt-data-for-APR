Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the weak reference to the PeriodIndex being dropped prematurely, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The weak reference to the PeriodIndex is not being handled properly, leading to its premature dropping and causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None value.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is properly maintained and not dropped prematurely.
2. Check if there are any issues with the lifecycle management of the PeriodIndex object and the weak reference.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type  # Ensure _engine_type is accessible before weakref
    return engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected code, the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained properly, and the PeriodEngine should receive the expected PeriodIndex object instead of None. This should resolve the issue described in the bug report.
