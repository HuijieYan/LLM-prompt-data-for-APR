It seems like the error is occurring in the `is_monotonic_increasing` method of the `PeriodEngine` class. The error message indicates that there is an AttributeError at the line `return super(PeriodEngine, self).vgetter().view("i8")`. This suggests that the `self` object does not have a `vgetter()` method, leading to the AttributeError.

The error is likely occurring due to the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped prematurely, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this issue, the `_engine` function should ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is maintained until it is no longer needed by the `PeriodEngine`.

The corrected code for the `_engine` function is as follows:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    class CustomPeriodEngine(PeriodEngine):
        def __init__(self, period, length):
            self.period = period
            self.length = length
            super().__init__()
    
    return CustomPeriodEngine(period, len(self))
```

In this corrected code, we create a custom `PeriodEngine` class within the `_engine` method, which ensures that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is maintained within the `CustomPeriodEngine` instance until it is no longer needed. This should prevent the premature dropping of the weakly referenced object and resolve the AttributeError issue.
