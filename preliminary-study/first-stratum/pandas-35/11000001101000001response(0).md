Potential error location:
The issue seems to be in the _engine function, where it is returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The _engine function returns an instance of `self._engine_type` which should be an instance of `PeriodEngine`, but it seems like the implementation is not providing the correct type.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the `self._engine_type` is being correctly initialized or if it has the correct type assigned to it.
2. Ensure that the `self._engine_type` is an instance of `PeriodEngine`, as expected.

Corrected code:
```python
from weakref import ref

# file name: /Users/jerry/.abw/BugsInPy_Dir/BugsInPy_Cloned_Repos/pandas/pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = ref(self)
    return PeriodEngine(period, len(self))
```
