The error occurs because the `_engine` function is returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` where `period` is a weak reference to `self`. But the weak reference isn't being handled properly. This leads to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, the weak reference should be properly handled when passing it to `self._engine_type`. This can be done by extracting the referent from the weak reference and passing it to the `_engine_type`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
from weakref import ref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = ref(self)  # use weakref.ref to create a weak reference
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))  # extract the referent using period()
```

With this modification, the weak reference is created properly and then the referent is extracted using `period()`. This should fix the bug and prevent the `NoneType` error from occurring.
