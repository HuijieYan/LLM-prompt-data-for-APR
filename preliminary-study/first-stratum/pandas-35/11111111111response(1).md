1. The test case `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `MultiIndex` and then attempts to check if all levels are monotonic. However, it raises an error where it tries to access the `is_monotonic` property on the levels.

2. The potential error location is within the `PeriodEngine` class which is a part of the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class. The error occurs when a weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a None instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is not being maintained properly, leading to it being dropped prematurely. This results in a None object being passed to the `PeriodEngine`, causing the AttributeError.

4. To fix the bug, one possible approach is to ensure that the weak reference to `PeriodIndex` is properly maintained within the `_engine` function, so that it is not dropped prematurely. This can be achieved by modifying the way the weak reference is obtained and used to ensure that it remains valid throughout the execution of the `PeriodEngine`.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
By making sure to properly maintain the weak reference to `PeriodIndex`, the bug should be fixed, and the test case should return the expected output.
