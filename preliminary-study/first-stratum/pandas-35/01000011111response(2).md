1. The test case is attempting to create a MultiIndex from a PeriodIndex and then check if all the levels are monotonic. The error message suggests that there is an issue with the weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped before intended, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the `_engine` method, where a weak reference to `self` is being created but not used correctly.

3. The bug occurs because the weak reference to `self` is not being used properly in the `_engine` method. As a result, the `_engine` method may be receiving a None instead of the intended reference to `self`, causing the AttributeError when trying to access attributes of the None object.

4. To fix the bug, the weak reference to `self` needs to be utilized correctly in the `_engine` method to ensure that the reference to `self` is not dropped prematurely. This can be done by storing the weak reference and then using it to access the attributes of `self`.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    def wrapper(self):
        if not hasattr(self, '_cached_engine'):
            self._cached_engine = func(self)
        return self._cached_engine
    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store a weak reference of self
    self_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self_weakref(), len(self))
```
