Issue:
The main issue in the code is with the `__rsub__` method where the `DatetimeArray` is not being created properly when the `other` parameter is a `datetime64` type.

Reason:
The error occurs because the code attempts to create a `DatetimeArray` from the `other` parameter, which is a `datetime64` type. This results in a ValueError because a `DatetimeArray` should be created from an ndarray, Series, or Index.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:

To fix this issue, we can modify the `__rsub__` method to handle the `datetime64` type appropriately. If `other` is of type `datetime64`, it should be converted into a `DatetimeArray` without using the `DatetimeArray` constructor. The new `DatetimeArray` should be based on the `numpy.array` representing the `datetime64` value.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if not isinstance(other, DatetimeLikeArrayMixin):
            other = DatetimeArray(np.array([other], dtype=other.dtype))

        return other - self
    # ... (other conditions remain unchanged)
```

By modifying the code in this manner, we can ensure that the `DatetimeArray` is constructed correctly from the `datetime64` type, resolving the ValueError that was previously being raised.
