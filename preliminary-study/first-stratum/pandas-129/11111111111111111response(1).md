The error occurs in the `DatetimeLikeArrayMixin` class in the `__rsub__` method. The error message indicates that the issue is related to the `DatetimeArray` class, where it expects the `values` to be a DatetimeArray ndarray, or Series or Index containing one of those but receives a 'datetime64' type instead. This could be due to incorrect handling of the `other` variable in the `__rsub__` method.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `other` variable is passed correctly to the `DatetimeArray` constructor.

Here's the corrected code for the `__rsub__` method:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        # ndarray[datetime64] cannot be subtracted from self, so
        # we need to wrap in DatetimeArray/Index and flip the operation
        if not isinstance(other, DatetimeLikeArrayMixin):
            from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray
            other_data = np.array(other, dtype=self.dtype)
            other = DatetimeArray(other_data, freq=None)

        return other - self
    # ... (other cases)

    return -(self - other)
```

In this corrected code, we ensure that the `other` variable is transformed into an array and then used to create a `DatetimeArray` instance. This should handle the expected type correctly and prevent the ValueError from occurring.
