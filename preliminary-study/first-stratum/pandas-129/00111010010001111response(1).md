The error seems to be occurring in the DatetimeLikeArrayMixin class, particularly within the __rsub__ method. The method seems to be trying to handle different data types and perform certain operations based on the data types involved.

The error message indicates that a ValueError is being raised in the __init__ method of the DatetimeArray class. This suggests that there is an issue with the initialization of the DatetimeArray, potentially related to the input values.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that the input values are correctly validated and processed before initializing the DatetimeArray. This could involve checking the type of the input values and ensuring that they are compatible with the expectations of the DatetimeArray.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class DatetimeLikeArrayMixin(ExtensionOpsMixin, AttributesMixin, ExtensionArray):
    # ... omitted code ...
    
    def __rsub__(self, other):
        if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
            # ndarray[datetime64] cannot be subtracted from self, so
            # we need to wrap in DatetimeArray/Index and flip the operation
            if not isinstance(other, DatetimeLikeArrayMixin):
                from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray
                other = DatetimeArray(other, freq=self._freq)
            return other - self
        elif (
            is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype)
            and hasattr(other, "dtype")
            and not is_datetime64_any_dtype(other.dtype)
        ):
            raise TypeError(
                "cannot subtract {cls} from {typ}".format(
                    cls=type(self).__name__, typ=type(other).__name__
                )
            )
        elif is_period_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other):
            raise TypeError(
                "cannot subtract {cls} from {dtype}".format(
                    cls=type(self).__name__, dtype=other.dtype
                )
            )
        elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
            if lib.is_integer(other) or is_integer_dtype(other):
                return -(self - other)
            return (-self) + other
        return -(self - other)
```

In the corrected code, we are ensuring that the input values are correctly handled and passed to the DatetimeArray constructor, with the frequency (freq) parameter preserved. This should address the potential ValueError that was occurring in the original code.
