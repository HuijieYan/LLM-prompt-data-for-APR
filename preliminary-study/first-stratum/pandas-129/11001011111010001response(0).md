The error message "Unexpected type 'datetime64'. 'values' must be a DatetimeArray ndarray, or Series or Index containing one of those" suggests that the function is trying to perform an operation using a data type that is not supported.

The potential error location within the function is the conditional statement `is_datetime64_any_dtype(other)`. It is likely causing the issue because it checks for a specific data type (`datetime64`), but the condition might not be satisfied due to the input type `other` not being recognized as `datetime64`.

The occurrence of the bug is due to the function expecting the input parameter `other` to be of type `datetime64`, but it might be getting a different type of input, leading to the conditional statements not producing the expected behavior.

To fix the bug, it would be necessary to validate the input type of `other` before applying the conditions specific to `datetime64`. This can be achieved by checking if `other` is a datetime object and then proceeding with the appropriate conditional statement.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime.datetime) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        # ndarray[datetime64] cannot be subtracted from self, so
        # we need to wrap in DatetimeArray/Index and flip the operation
        if not isinstance(other, DatetimeLikeArrayMixin):
            # Avoid down-casting DatetimeIndex
            from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray

            other = DatetimeArray(other)
        return other - self
    elif (
        is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype)
        and hasattr(other, "dtype")
        and not is_datetime64_any_dtype(other.dtype)
    ):
        # GH#19959 datetime - datetime is well-defined as timedelta,
        # but any other type - datetime is not well-defined.
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {cls} from {typ}".format(
                cls=type(self).__name__, typ=type(other).__name__
            )
        )
    elif is_period_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other):
        # TODO: Can we simplify/generalize these cases at all?
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {cls} from {dtype}".format(
                cls=type(self).__name__, dtype=other.dtype
            )
        )
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if isinstance(other, int) or isinstance(other, float):
            # need to subtract before negating, since that flips freq
            # -self flips self.freq, messing up results
            return -(self - other)

        return (-self) + other

    return -(self - other)
```
In this corrected code, the `isinstance()` function is used to check if `other` is an instance of datetime, and then the appropriate conditional statement is executed based on the result of this check.
