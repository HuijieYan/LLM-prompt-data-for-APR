The error message indicates that the input type 'datetime64' is unexpected. This suggests that the function may not be handling this input type correctly.

The potential error in the function seems to be in the conditional statements that check for the type of 'other' variable. The condition checks for 'is_datetime64_any_dtype(other)' and also checks for the type of 'self.dtype', which seems to be redundant and may be causing conflicts.

The bug occurs because the buggy function is not handling the input datetime64 type correctly, leading to unexpected results.

To fix the bug, we can simplify the conditional statements to directly handle the datetime64 type as a separate case. This will ensure that the function deals with datetime64 inputs appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other):
        if not isinstance(other, (DatetimeIndex, DatetimeArray)):
            from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray
            other = DatetimeArray(other)
        return other - self
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if lib.is_integer(other) or is_integer_dtype(other):
            return -(self - other)
        return (-self) + other
    return -(self - other)
```
