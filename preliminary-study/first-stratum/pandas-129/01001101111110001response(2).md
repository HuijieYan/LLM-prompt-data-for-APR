The error message indicates that the "datetime64" type is unexpected and that the values must be a DatetimeArray ndarray, Series, or Index containing one of those types. This suggests that the issue lies in the handling of the "datetime64" type within the function.

The function "__rsub__" is designed to handle subtraction operations involving datetime and timedelta objects. The bug occurs because the function does not handle the "datetime64" type correctly, leading to unexpected behavior and error messages.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the "datetime64" type, including the checks and operations related to this type. Additionally, it may be necessary to ensure that the input types are appropriately validated before performing any operations.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import (is_datetime64_any_dtype,
                                       is_timedelta64_dtype,
                                       is_period_dtype)
from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray
from pandas._libs import lib
from pandas._libs.tslibs.timestamps import Timestamp
from pandas import Timestamp, timedelta_range
import pandas as pd
import pytest
import numpy as np
import pandas._testing as tm

def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if not isinstance(other, (DatetimeArray, pd.Series, pd.Index)):
            other = pd.to_datetime(other)
        return other - self
    elif is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype) and (hasattr(other, "dtype") and
            not is_datetime64_any_dtype(other.dtype)):
        raise TypeError("cannot subtract {cls} from {typ}".format(
            cls=type(self).__name__, typ=type(other).__name__))
    elif is_period_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other):
        raise TypeError("cannot subtract {cls} from {dtype}".format(
            cls=type(self).__name__, dtype=other.dtype))
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if lib.is_integer(other) or is_integer_dtype(other):
            return -(self - other)
        return (-self) + other
    return -(self - other)
```

In the corrected function, we added checks to ensure that the "other" input is properly handled as a datetime type, converting it to a DatetimeArray if necessary. We also handled the subtraction with timedelta operations based on the input types.

This should address the issues and handle the "datetime64" type properly, preventing the error that occurred in the test case.
