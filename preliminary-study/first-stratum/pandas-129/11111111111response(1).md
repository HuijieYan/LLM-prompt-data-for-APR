1. The test case is trying to assert that the result of `ts - tdarr` is equal to `expected2`. The error message indicates that the code is trying to initialize a `DatetimeArray` with a `datetime64` type, which is unexpected. This indicates that the error is likely occurring in the `__rsub__` method when attempting to initialize `DatetimeArray`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `other = DatetimeArray(other)`.

3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that when the `__rsub__` method is invoked, it attempts to initialize a `DatetimeArray` with `other` as an argument. However, if `other` is a `datetime64` type, this will result in a `ValueError` because the code expects `other` to be a `DatetimeArray` ndarray, or Series or Index containing one of those.

4. To fix the bug, we should not attempt to initialize a `DatetimeArray` with `other` when `other` is of type `datetime64`. Instead, we can directly operate on the `datetime64` type without the need to initialize a `DatetimeArray`.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        return other - self
    elif (
            is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype)
            and hasattr(other, "dtype")
            and not is_datetime64_any_dtype(other.dtype)
    ):
        # GH#19959 datetime - datetime is well-defined as timedelta,
        # but any other type - datetime is not well-defined.
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {cls} from {typ}".format(
                cls=type(self).__name__, typ=type(other).__name__
            )
        )
    elif is_period_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other):
        # TODO: Can we simplify/generalize these cases at all?
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {cls} from {dtype}".format(
                cls=type(self).__name__, dtype=other.dtype
            )
        )
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if lib.is_integer(other) or is_integer_dtype(other):
            # need to subtract before negating, since that flips freq
            # -self flips self.freq, messing up results
            return -(self - other)

        return (-self) + other

    return -(self - other)
```

After making these changes, the code should no longer attempt to initialize a `DatetimeArray` with `other` when `other` is of type `datetime64`, thus fixing the bug.
