The error message indicates that the function is expecting a `DatetimeArray` or a `Series` or `Index` containing it, but is receiving a different type (`datetime64`). This suggests that the bug is likely occurring in the type checking and conversion part of the function.

The bug seems to occur due to the function's inability to handle the `datetime64` type properly when performing subtraction.

To fix this bug, the function should be updated to handle the `datetime64` type properly when performing subtraction. The type checking should be modified to recognize and handle `datetime64` types as expected.

The corrected code for the function is as follows:

```python
import pandas as pd

def __rsub__(self, other):
    if pd.api.types.is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and pd.api.types.is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        # ndarray[datetime64] cannot be subtracted from self, so
        # we need to wrap in DatetimeArray/Index and flip the operation
        if not isinstance(other, pd.DatetimeLikeArrayMixin):
            # Avoid down-casting DatetimeIndex
            other = pd.DatetimeIndex(other)
        return other - self
    elif (
        pd.api.types.is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype)
        and hasattr(other, "dtype")
        and not pd.api.types.is_datetime64_any_dtype(other.dtype)
    ):
        # GH#19959 datetime - datetime is well-defined as timedelta,
        # but any other type - datetime is not well-defined.
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {cls} from {typ}".format(
                cls=type(self).__name__, typ=type(other).__name__
            )
        )
    elif pd.api.types.is_period_dtype(self.dtype) and pd.api.types.is_timedelta64_dtype(other):
        # TODO: Can we simplify/generalize these cases at all?
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {cls} from {dtype}".format(
                cls=type(self).__name__, dtype=other.dtype
            )
        )
    elif pd.api.types.is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype(other):
            # need to subtract before negating, since that flips freq
            # -self flips self.freq, messing up results
            return -(self - other)

        return (-self) + other

    return -(self - other)
```

This corrected code includes the use of `pd.api.types` for type checking and handling of `datetime64` types as well as updating the handling of these different types when performing subtraction.
