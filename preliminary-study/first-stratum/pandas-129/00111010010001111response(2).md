The bug is occurring at the `__rsub__` method of the `DatetimeLikeArrayMixin` class. The error message indicates that the creation of a `DatetimeArray` object from the `other` parameter is causing the issue, specifically with the `values` variable.

The error is occurring because the `values` variable, which should be an instance of a `DatetimeArray` ndarray, or a Series or Index containing one of those, is not meeting the expected type.

To fix this bug, you can refactor the `__rsub__` method and properly initialize the `DatetimeArray` object without encountering unexpected type issues.

Here is the corrected code for the `__rsub__` method:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    import numpy as np
    from pandas import Timestamp

    if (self.dtype == np.dtype('<m8[ns]') or is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype)) and isinstance(other, (Timestamp, np.datetime64)):
        # Convert other parameter to DatetimeArray
        from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray
        other = DatetimeArray([other])

        if is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
            return other - self
    else:
        return -(self - other)
```

This refactored code first checks if the `self` parameter is of type `<m8[ns]` or timedelta64. If so, it validates the type of the `other` parameter and converts it to a `DatetimeArray`. It then performs the subtraction and returns the result. If the type checks fail, it falls back to the original computation by returning `-(self - other)`.

Note: This is a hypothetical refactored solution, independent on the class structure, other methods, and libraries present in the application. Further modification might be needed to fully integrate this solution.
