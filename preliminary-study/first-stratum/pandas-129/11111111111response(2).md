1. From the test case, it's clear that the error is occurring in the `test_td64arr_add_sub_datetimelike_scalar` function. The error is raised while using the `tm.assert_equal` function, specifically when trying to assert equality for the subtraction operation (`ts - tdarr`). The error indicates a problem within the `DatetimeArray` object with type 'datetime64'.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the `__rsub__` method of `DatetimeLikeArrayMixin`. This method is responsible for handling the right-hand subtraction operation for `DatetimeArray`.

3. The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of the `DatetimeArray` object. Type mismatch issues are present, which lead to the ValueError being raised during the execution of the subtraction operation.

4. To fix the bug, proper type validation needs to be implemented in the `__rsub__` method. Additionally, handling the right-hand subtraction operation for `DatetimeArray` should be carefully considered to avoid type conflicts and ensure the correct behavior of the subtraction operation.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `__rsub__` method:
```python
# this is the corrected __rsub__ method
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        # ndarray[datetime64] cannot be subtracted from self, so
        # we need to wrap in DatetimeArray/Index and flip the operation
        if not isinstance(other, DatetimeLikeArrayMixin):
            from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray
            other = DatetimeArray(other)
        return other - self
    elif is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype) and hasattr(other, "dtype") and not is_datetime64_any_dtype(other.dtype):
        # GH#19959 datetime - datetime is well-defined as timedelta,
        # but any other type - datetime is not well-defined.
        raise TypeError("cannot subtract {cls} from {typ}".format(cls=type(self).__name__, typ=type(other).__name__))
    elif is_period_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other):
        raise TypeError("cannot subtract {cls} from {dtype}".format(cls=type(self).__name__, dtype=other.dtype))
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if lib.is_integer(other) or is_integer_dtype(other):
            # need to subtract before negating, since that flips freq
            # -self flips self.freq, messing up results
            return -(self - other)
        return (-self) + other

    return -(self - other)  # This is the default case
```
In the corrected code, we've added type validation checks and ensured proper handling of the `DatetimeArray` object to avoid the type mismatch issue, and enable correct subtraction operation.
