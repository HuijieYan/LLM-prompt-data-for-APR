The potential error in the buggy function is in the conditional statements. The function is not handling all possible cases correctly, leading to potential errors and crashes.

When dealing with date and time operations, it's important to ensure that the types and operations are handled appropriately. The buggy function fails to handle some cases related to datetime and timedelta operations, leading to potential type errors and incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the conditional statements and type checks need to be revised to ensure that the function handles datetime and timedelta operations correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    # Check for datetime64 and timedelta64 type
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        # ndarray[datetime64] cannot be subtracted from self, so
        # we need to wrap in DatetimeArray/Index and flip the operation
        if not isinstance(other, DatetimeLikeArrayMixin):
            # Avoid down-casting DatetimeIndex
            from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray

            other = DatetimeArray(other)
        return other - self
    elif is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype) and isinstance(other, np.timedelta64):
        # Handle datetime - timedelta
        return self - other
    elif isinstance(other, np.timedelta64) and is_period_dtype(self.dtype):
        # Handle period - timedelta
        return self - other
    else:
        # If no specific case is matched, return the default subtraction
        return -(self - other)
```

In the corrected function, additional checks have been added to handle specific cases, such as datetime - timedelta and period - timedelta operations. This should ensure that the function handles different types and operations appropriately, preventing potential errors and crashes.
