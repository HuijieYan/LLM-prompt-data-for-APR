The buggy function is __rsub__ which is a method used for the subtraction operation with reflected operands. The function crashes due to the presence of multiple different conditional paths which might cause incorrect operation or unintended error types.

In the first conditional block, the function is attempting to subtract a datetime from a timedelta array. The intention is to wrap the datetime object (other) in a DatetimeArray and then subtract self from it. However, there are potential issues with the DatetimeArray constructor.

The correct approach to fix this would be to properly handle the construction of DatetimeArray and avoid down-casting DatetimeIndex. Additionally, the operation other - self should be performed instead of self - other.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function __rsub__:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if not isinstance(other, DatetimeLikeArrayMixin):  # Avoid down-casting DatetimeIndex
            from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray
            other = DatetimeArray([other] * len(self))  # Construct DatetimeArray from other

        return other - self  # Perform other - self instead of self - other
    # ... other conditional blocks
    else:
        return other - self  # Perform other - self as the default operation
```

This corrected code should address the issues with error handling and ensure appropriate operations for timedelta arrays and datetime objects.
