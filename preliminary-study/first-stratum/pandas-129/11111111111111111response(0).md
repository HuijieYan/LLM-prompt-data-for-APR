Based on the error message, it appears that the issue lies within the `DatetimeArray` instantiation inside the `__rsub__` function of the `DatetimeLikeArrayMixin` class. The instantiation is causing a `ValueError` with the message "Unexpected type 'datetime64'. 'values' must be a DatetimeArray ndarray, or Series or Index containing one of those."

The bug occurs because the `DatetimeArray` instantiation is receiving a single `numpy.datetime64` object as input, which is not compatible with the expected input format, leading to the `ValueError`.

To fix this bug, the `__rsub__` function should be modified to handle the `numpy.datetime64` object appropriately. The `DatetimeArray` should only be instantiated if the input is an array of datetime values, not for individual datetime values.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if isinstance(other, (pd.Series, pd.Index)):
            other = other.values
        if isinstance(other, np.ndarray) and is_datetime64_any_dtype(other.dtype):
            return other - self
        else:
            raise ValueError("Invalid type for 'other'. Expected DatetimeArray, ndarray, Series or Index containing datetime values.")
    
    # Handle other cases as before
    # ...
```

In this fixed version, if `other` is a Series or Index, it retrieves the underlying numpy array, and then checks if it contains datetime values. If it does, it performs the subtraction as before; otherwise, it raises a ValueError indicating the invalid type for 'other'.

This modification should resolve the issue and allow the function to handle different input types correctly.
