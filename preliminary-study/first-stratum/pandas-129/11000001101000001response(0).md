The problem with the __rsub__ method is that it checks the type of `other` and the `self.dtype` incorrectly and doesn't handle the given cases properly.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the condition and handling of different types like datetime64, timedelta, and other types.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug are:
- Incorrect handling of datetime64 and timedelta64 types.
- Improper type-checks and handling logic.

To fix the bug:
- Validate the types `other` and `self.dtype` properly.
- Adjust the if-else conditions to handle each type appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        # ndarray[datetime64] cannot be subtracted from self, so
        # we need to wrap in DatetimeArray/Index and flip the operation
        if not isinstance(self, DatetimeLikeArrayMixin):
            # Avoid down-casting DatetimeIndex
            from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray

            self = DatetimeArray(self)
        return self - other
    elif (
        is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype)
        and hasattr(other, "dtype")
        and not is_datetime64_any_dtype(other.dtype)
    ):
        # GH#19959 datetime - datetime is well-defined as timedelta,
        # but any other type - datetime is not well-defined.
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {cls} from {typ}".format(
                cls=type(other).__name__, typ=type(self).__name__
            )
        )
    elif is_period_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other.dtype):
        # TODO: Can we simplify/generalize these cases at all?
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {gdt} from {dt}".format(
                gdt=type(other).__name__, dt=type(self).__name__
            )
        )
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if lib.is_integer(other) or is_integer_dtype(other):
            # need to subtract before negating, since that flips freq
            # -self flips self.freq, messing up results
            return -(other - self)

        return other + (-self)

    return other - self
```

This corrected code should handle the various types and subtractions appropriately.
