The error occurs in the `__rsub__` method of the `DatetimeArray` object. The error message indicates that the `values` parameter passed to the `DatetimeArray` constructor is of type 'datetime64', which is unexpected. The `DatetimeArray` constructor is expecting an instance of `DatetimeArray` ndarray, or Series, or Index containing one of those.

The bug occurred because the `DatetimeArray` constructor was not handling the case where the input `values` are already of type 'datetime64'. As a result, it raised a `ValueError` with the message "Unexpected type 'datetime64'. 'values' must be a DatetimeArray ndarray, or Series or Index containing one of those."

To fix the bug, the `__rsub__` method of the `DatetimeArray` object needs to be modified to handle the case where the input `values` are already of type 'datetime64'. This can be done by adding a condition to check if the input `values` are of type 'datetime64', and then create a `DatetimeArray` based on them.

Here's the corrected code for the `__rsub__` method:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        # ndarray[datetime64] cannot be subtracted from self, so
        # we need to wrap in DatetimeArray/Index and flip the operation
        if not isinstance(other, DatetimeLikeArrayMixin):
            # Avoid down-casting DatetimeIndex
            from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray
            if isinstance(other, np.ndarray) and other.dtype == np.dtype('<M8[ns]'):
                other = DatetimeArray(other)
            else:
                other = DatetimeArray([other])

        return other - self
    # rest of the code remains the same
```

With this modification, the `__rsub__` method will first check if the input `other` is of type 'datetime64'. If it is, the method will create a `DatetimeArray` based on the input `other` and then perform the subtraction. Otherwise, it will proceed with the existing logic.
