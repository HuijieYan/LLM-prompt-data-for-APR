The error message "Unexpected type 'datetime64'. 'values' must be a DatetimeArray ndarray, or Series or Index containing one of those" suggests that there is an issue with the type of the variable `other` in the function `__rsub__`. The function expects `other` to be a DatetimeArray ndarray, Series, or Index, but it is receiving a `datetime64` type instead.

The potential error location within the problematic function is when the input parameter `other` is being used. It checks if `other` is of type `datetime64`, and this check might be leading to the issue.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not handling the type `datetime64` properly, leading to a mismatch with the expected type.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the function to handle the `datetime64` type appropriately. This could involve converting `other` to a DatetimeArray ndarray, Series, or Index before using it within the function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if not isinstance(other, DatetimeLikeArrayMixin):
            from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray
            other = DatetimeArray(other)
        return other - self
    # Handle 'datetime64' type appropriately
    elif isinstance(other, np.datetime64):
        other = pd.to_datetime(other)
        return other - self
    # Handle other cases as before
    # ... (rest of the code remains the same)
```

In this corrected code, we are handling the `datetime64` type by converting it to a proper format compatible with the expected types in the function.
