The bug occurs in the `__rsub__` method of the `DatetimeArray` class. In this method, the bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the `other` parameter of the function. The method throws a ValueError because it expects the `other` parameter to be a DatetimeArray ndarray, or Series or Index containing one of those, but it receives a type 'datetime64'. This results in a TypeError being raised due to an unexpected type.

To fix this bug, the `__rsub__` method should be modified to correctly handle the `other` parameter. When `other` is an instance of `numpy.datetime64` and `self` is an instance of `DatetimeArray`, it should convert `other` to a `DatetimeArray` to be able to perform the subtraction operation properly. 

Here's the corrected `__rsub__` method:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray

    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        other = DatetimeArray([other])
        return other - self
    # (rest of the conditions and operations as per original code)
```

With this change, the `other` parameter is converted to a `DatetimeArray` when it's a `numpy.datetime64`, resolving the ValueError that was being raised.
