The issue appears to be with the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function where it is calculating the accuracy incorrectly based on the input shape of `y_true`.

The error message indicates that there is an issue with the shape of the input and the way it is being handled within the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function.

The potential error location within the function is the assumption that the shape of `y_true` is always `(num_samples, 1)` without considering the possibility of its shape being `(num_samples,)`.

The error occurred most likely because the function is not handling the different shapes of `y_true` properly, leading to incorrect calculations. The code should be modified to handle both shapes of `y_true` appropriately.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Check the shape of `y_true` and, if it is `(num_samples, 1)`, squeeze the array to make it `(num_samples,)`.
- Modify the function to handle both shapes of `y_true` correctly.

Corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import backend as K

def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    if K.int_shape(y_true)[-1] == 1:
        y_true = tf.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```

This corrected code checks the shape of `y_true` and squeezes it if it has the shape `(num_samples, 1)`. It then proceeds to calculate the accuracy based on the modified `y_true`. This should fix the bug and handle both shapes of `y_true` appropriately.
