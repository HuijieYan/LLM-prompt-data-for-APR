The error is likely occurring in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function, specifically in the `K.in_top_k` call. The error message suggests that the shape of `y_true` is causing the issue, as it is expecting a rank 1 shape but receiving a rank 0 shape.

The bug occurs because the `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` returns a tensor with shape (2, 3) instead of (2,) which is not compatible with `K.in_top_k`. Additionally, there is confusion in the input parameters given the descriptions. It looks like `y_true` and `y_pred` are expected to be rank 2 tensors, contrary to the given information.

To fix the issue, the `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` should be removed, and the behavior should be modified to accommodate the correct shapes of `y_true` and `y_pred`. Also, the function should handle the different shapes of `y_true` appropriately.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true = K.cast(y_true, 'int32')
    top_k = K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), k)
    return K.mean(top_k, axis=-1)
```

This corrected function directly uses `K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1)` to determine the indices of the maximum values in `y_true`. Then, it uses `K.in_top_k` to compare these indices with `y_pred` to calculate the top-k categorical accuracy. This approach handles the different shapes of `y_true` correctly.
