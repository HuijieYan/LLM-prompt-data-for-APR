The error is likely occurring in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` method, which is called by the `test_sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function. The error message indicates that there is a problem with the shape of the input tensors.

The bug occurs because the code assumes the shape of `y_true` to be `(num_samples, 1)` and always reduces in the last dimension, which leads to incorrect output. However, the shape of `y_true` can also be `(num_samples,)`, as mentioned in the issue description.

To fix the bug:
1. Check the shape of `y_true` and squeeze if applicable.
2. Modify the code to handle both shapes of `y_true` appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    if len(y_true.shape) > 1:
        y_true = tf.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)
    return tf.reduce_mean(tf.cast(tf.nn.in_top_k(y_pred, y_true, k), tf.float32))
```

In this corrected code, we check the shape of `y_true`. If its shape has more than 1 dimension, we squeeze it along the last axis. This ensures that the function can handle both shapes of `y_true` correctly.
