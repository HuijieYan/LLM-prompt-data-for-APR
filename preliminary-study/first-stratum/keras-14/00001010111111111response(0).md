The error occurs because the `y_true` variable has a shape of (num_samples,) which causes the `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` function to create a scalar output instead of a vector. This scalar output is causing the error when it is used as an input to `K.cast` and `K.in_top_k` functions.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the shape of the `y_true` variable is handled correctly, taking into account both cases where the shape is (num_samples, 1) and (num_samples,). We can modify the function to handle the shape of `y_true` properly and then squeeze if applicable.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    if K.ndim(y_true) == K.ndim(y_pred):
        y_true = K.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```

In this corrected function, we check if the dimensions of `y_true` and `y_pred` are the same. If they are, we squeeze the `y_true` tensor along the last axis. Then, we pass the modified `y_true` tensor to the `K.cast` and `K.in_top_k` functions.

This fix should handle both cases of `y_true` correctly and prevent the error from occurring.
