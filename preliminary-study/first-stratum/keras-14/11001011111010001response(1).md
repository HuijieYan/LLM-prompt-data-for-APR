The error message indicates that there is an issue with the shape of the input to the `in_top_k` function. The error message specifically mentions that "Shape must be rank 1 but is rank 0." This suggests that the issue is with the input shapes to the `in_top_k` function.

The buggy function `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` is using the `K.in_top_k` function, which compares the top-k predictions against the true labels. The issue is likely related to the way the input to `in_top_k` is being constructed.

The bug occurs because the `in_top_k` function expects the true labels to be one-hot encoded, but the current implementation does not handle this. This results in a shape mismatch when the function is called.

To fix this bug, the true labels should be one-hot encoded before passing them to the `in_top_k` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true_onehot = tf.one_hot(y_true, y_pred.shape[-1])
    return tf.reduce_mean(tf.cast(tf.nn.in_top_k(y_pred, y_true_onehot, k), tf.float32), axis=-1)
```

In this corrected code:
- We use `tf.one_hot` to convert `y_true` into a one-hot encoded format.
- We then use `tf.nn.in_top_k` to compare the predictions `y_pred` against the one-hot encoded `y_true`.
- Finally, we calculate the mean accuracy across the predictions using `tf.reduce_mean`.

This approach ensures that the input shapes match the requirements of the `in_top_k` function, fixing the bug and allowing the function to work as expected.
