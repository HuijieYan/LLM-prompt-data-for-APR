The error message indicates that the `in_top_k` function is receiving inputs of incorrect shapes. This is likely due to the `K.cast(K.max(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32')` portion of the code, where the `y_true` tensor is being cast to 'int32' but not maintaining its original shape.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the shape of the casted `y_true` tensor is preserved. We can achieve this by using `K.argmax` instead of `K.max` and remove the unnecessary use of `K.cast`.

Here's the corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true = K.cast(y_true, 'int32')
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), k), axis=-1)
```
This corrected code avoids casting the `y_true` tensor to 'int32' prematurely and properly uses `K.argmax` to maintain the shape of the `y_true` tensor.
