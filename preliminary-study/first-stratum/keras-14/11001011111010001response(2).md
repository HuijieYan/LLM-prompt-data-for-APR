The error message indicates that the input shapes for the 'in_top_k' operation are not compatible. This means that the shapes of the input arrays are not as expected by the 'in_top_k' operation.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the K.in_top_k function call, where the shapes of the input arrays need to be modified.

The bug occurred because the 'in_top_k' function is expecting the shape of the input array to be rank 1, but it is receiving an array of shape [2, 3] for y_pred, and an array of shape [2] for y_true.

To fix the bug, the shapes of the input arrays for the 'in_top_k' function need to be modified to be rank 1.

```python
# Corrected function
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(K.max(y_pred, axis=-1), K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```
