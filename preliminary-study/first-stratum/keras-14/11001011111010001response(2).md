The error message indicates that there is an issue with the shape of the input to the `in_top_k` function. The error specifies that the shape must be rank 1 but is rank 0.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `K.in_top_k` function call within the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function.

The bug occurred because the shape of the input to the `in_top_k` function is not compatible. The `in_top_k` function expects the target tensor to be of shape [batch_size, num_classes], and the index tensor to be of shape [batch_size].

To fix the bug, the shape of the input to the `in_top_k` function needs to be adjusted so that it matches the expected shapes.

Here's the corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
import keras.backend as K

def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), k), axis=-1)
```

In the corrected code, the `in_top_k` function takes `y_pred` as the target tensor and `K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1)` as the index tensor. This ensures that the shapes are compatible with the expected inputs for the `in_top_k` function.
