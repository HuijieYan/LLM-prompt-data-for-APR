The issue seems to be with the line `K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(K.max(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32'), k), axis=-1)` in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function. The error message suggests that the shape of `y_true` is causing the problem, as it may be assumed to have a shape of (num_samples, 1) when it can actually be (num_samples,).

The bug occurs because the function assumes the shape of `y_true` to be (num_samples, 1) and always reduces in the last dimension. However, the shape of `y_true` can be (num_samples,) in some cases, leading to incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we need to check the shape of `y_true` and squeeze it if applicable to avoid the incorrect output. We can modify the function to handle both cases of `y_true`'s shape: (num_samples, 1) and (num_samples,).

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    if K.int_shape(y_true)[-1] == 1:
        y_true = K.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```

In the corrected function, we first check if the last dimension of `y_true` is equal to 1. If it is, we squeeze `y_true` along that dimension. Then we proceed with the rest of the function as before, ensuring that the shapes are handled correctly regardless of the input.
