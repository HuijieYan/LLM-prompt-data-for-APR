The error is occurring in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function due to the incorrect usage of the `K.max` function. The function is expecting the shape of `y_true` to be (num_samples, 1) or (num_samples), but it is not handling both cases correctly.

The bug is occurring because the existing code of the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function assumes the shape of `y_true` to be (num_samples, 1), and always reduces in the last dimension. However, this assumption is not valid for all cases, leading to incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the implementation of the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function to check the shape of `y_true` and squeeze it if applicable. This will ensure that the function handles both shapes, (num_samples, 1) and (num_samples), correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.python.keras import backend as K

def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true = K.squeeze(y_true, axis=1)  # Squeeze if the shape is (num_samples, 1)
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```

This modification ensures that the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function handles both shapes of `y_true` correctly, fixing the bug and producing the expected results.
