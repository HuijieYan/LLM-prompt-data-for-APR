The error occurs in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function in the `keras/metrics.py` file. The issue seems to be related to the shape of the input `y_true` and the way it is being processed. The error message indicates a problem with the shape of the input tensor.

The bug seems to be caused by assuming that the shape of `y_true` is always `(num_samples, 1)`, which is not always the case. The bug can be fixed by checking the shape of the input `y_true` and squeezing it if the shape is `(num_samples, 1)`.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function by checking the shape of `y_true` and squeezing it if necessary.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true_shape = K.int_shape(y_true)
    if len(y_true_shape) > 1 and y_true_shape[1] == 1:
        y_true = K.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```

This corrected function checks the shape of `y_true` and squeezes it if the shape is `(num_samples, 1)`. It then proceeds to calculate the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` based on the modified `y_true`.

This fix should address the issue with the shape of the input tensor and resolve the error encountered in the test cases.
