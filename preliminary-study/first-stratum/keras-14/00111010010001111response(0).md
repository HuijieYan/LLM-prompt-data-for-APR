The issue is likely occurring because the function `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` is assuming the shape of `y_true` to be `(num_samples, 1)` and always reducing in the last dimension, which is leading to incorrect output.

The bug can be fixed by checking the shape of `y_true` and squeezing if applicable.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    if K.int_shape(y_true)[-1] == 1:
        y_true = K.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```
