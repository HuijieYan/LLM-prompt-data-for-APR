The potential error in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function is with the `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` call. This call is trying to get the maximum value along the last dimension of `y_true`, which would result in a tensor of shape (2,), but the `K.cast` function is attempting to cast it to 'int32', which is not compatible with the shape of the tensor.

To fix this, we can modify the `K.max` call to use `K.argmax` instead, which will return the indices of the maximum values along the last dimension of `y_true`.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32'), k),
                  axis=-1)
```
