The error is occurring because the `K.max` function does not return the expected output. The `K.max` function is used to find the maximum value along the specified axis, but it is returning a tensor with the shape (2, 3) instead of returning the indices of the maximum value along the specified axis.

To fix the bug, the `K.argmax` function should be used instead of `K.max` to find the indices of the maximum value along the specified axis.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32'), k),
                  axis=-1)
```

With this correction, the function should behave as expected and the error in the test case should be resolved.
