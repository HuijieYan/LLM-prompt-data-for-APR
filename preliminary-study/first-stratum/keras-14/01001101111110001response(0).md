The error message indicates that there is an issue with the shape of the inputs when using the `in_top_k` function. This suggests that the bug is likely located in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function, particularly in the `K.in_top_k` and `K.max` calls.

The bug occurs because `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` is reducing the rank of the tensor `y_true` instead of finding the maximum value along the last axis. This causes the shape mismatch when trying to compare it with `y_pred` in `K.in_top_k`.

To fix the bug, the `K.max` call should be modified to find the maximum value along the last axis, while preserving the rank of the tensor. Additionally, the type casting of `y_true` to 'int32' is also necessary for comparison with `y_pred` using `K.in_top_k`.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32'), k),
                  axis=-1)
```

This fix ensures that the correct maximum value along the last axis of `y_true` is used for comparison, and the type is properly cast for comparison with `y_pred` using `K.in_top_k`.
