The error message is related to the shape of the input parameters for the `in_top_k` function. The error indicates that the shapes of the input parameters are not compatible with the requirements of the `in_top_k` function.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `K.cast(K.max(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32')` part. It seems that the casting operation and the `max` operation are not producing the expected shapes for the input to the `in_top_k` function.

The bug occurred because the `K.cast(K.max(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32')` part is trying to cast the maximum value of `y_true` to an integer without considering the shape of `y_true`.

To fix the bug, the shape of `y_true` needs to be appropriately considered when calculating the maximum value and then casting it to an integer. It's important to ensure that the shape of the input to the `in_top_k` function matches the required format.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```

In the corrected code, `K.argmax` is used to find the indices of the maximum values in `y_true` along the specified axis, and then those indices are cast to 'int32' to match the requirements of the `in_top_k` function. This ensures that the shape of the input to the `in_top_k` function is compatible and resolves the bug.
