The error message indicates that the problem lies within the `in_top_k` function. The error states that the shape provided to the `in_top_k` function is incorrect.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` part because it returns the maximum value along the last axis of `y_true`. However, it seems like the intended behavior is to get the index of the maximum value along the last axis of `y_true`.

The bug occurs because the `K.max` function returns the maximum value instead of the index of the maximum value. This results in the shape mismatch error when `K.in_top_k` is called.

One approach to fixing the bug is to use the `K.argmax` function instead of `K.max` to get the index of the maximum value along the last axis of `y_true`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32'), k),
                  axis=-1)
```
