The error occurs in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function where the `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` is causing the issue. The `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` function reduces the last dimension of `y_true`, which causes a shape mismatch error later in the `in_top_k` function.

The bug occurs because the code assumes the shape of y_true is (num_samples, 1) and always reduces the last dimension, leading to an incorrect output. The function should check the shape of y_true and squeeze if applicable.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function to handle both shapes of y_true, i.e., (num_samples, 1) and (num_samples), and squeeze the dimensions accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    if K.int_shape(y_true)[-1] == 1:
        y_true = K.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```
