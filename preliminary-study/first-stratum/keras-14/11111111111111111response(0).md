The error is likely occurring in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function within the Keras library. The function is meant to calculate the top-k categorical accuracy for sparse categorical values.

The error message indicates a problem with the shape of the input, specifically with the `in_top_k` operation. The error states that the shape must be rank 1 but is rank 0.

The issue is likely caused by the assumption that the shape of `y_true` is `(num_samples, 1)` and always reducing in the last dimension, which is incorrect. The shape could also be `(num_samples,)`, and failing to handle this scenario properly is leading to the error.

To fix this bug, the function needs to be modified to check the shape of `y_true` and squeeze if applicable. This will ensure that the function handles both shapes `(num_samples, 1)` and `(num_samples,)` correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    # Squeeze the y_true if the shape is (num_samples, 1)
    y_true = tf.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)
    
    # Use in_top_k with the updated y_true
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```

This updated function checks the shape of `y_true` and squeezes it if necessary before using the `in_top_k` operation. This should fix the bug and ensure that the function works correctly for both shapes of `y_true`.
