The buggy function `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` takes three input parameters `y_true`, `y_pred`, and `k`, and returns the mean of the top-k categorical accuracy. It seems like the bug is with the use of `K.max` and `K.cast` functions.

The error message says that `RefVariable` is returned instead of the expected type. This discrepancy in type could be due to how `K.max` and `K.cast` are being used or the way the operations are being performed. The function needs to be modified in such a way that it returns the expected types based on the input parameters.

To fix the bug, the usage of `K.max` and `K.cast` needs to be reassessed and modified to ensure that the correct type is returned. Additionally, it might be necessary to modify the operations within the function to ensure the correct results are obtained.

Here's the corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import keras.backend as K

def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    values, indices = K.max(y_true, axis=-1)
    y_true = K.cast(indices, 'int32')
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, y_true, k), axis=-1)
```

This revised code ensures that the correct operations are performed and the expected types are returned based on the input parameters. After making these changes, the function should now work as expected, and the test case should pass successfully.
