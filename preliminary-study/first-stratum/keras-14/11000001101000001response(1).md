The error in the original code is caused by the incorrect use of the `K.max` function to find the maximum value in the `y_true` tensor. The `K.max` function is used to find the maximum value across all axes, but in this case, we need the maximum value along the last axis (axis=-1). Additionally, the `K.cast` function is used incorrectly. It should be applied to the result of `K.max` to cast the output to 'int32', not to the entire `y_true` tensor.

The following code fixes these issues:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32'), k),
                  axis=-1)
```

In this fixed code:
- `K.argmax` is used to find the indices of the maximum values along the last axis of `y_true`.
- Then, the result is cast to 'int32' using `K.cast`.
- The rest of the code remains the same.

This should resolve the issues and provide the expected behavior for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function.
