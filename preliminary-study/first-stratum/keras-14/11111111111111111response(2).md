The error occurs in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function, specifically in the line that calculates `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)`. The error message suggests that the shape of `y_true` is causing the issue, as it's expecting a rank 1 shape but receiving a rank 0 shape.

The bug occurs because the function assumes the shape of `y_true` is (num_samples, 1), always reducing in the last dimension. However, the shape of `y_true` can be (num_samples, 1) or (num_samples). This inconsistency leads to incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to check the shape of `y_true` and squeeze it if necessary. Additionally, we also need to fix `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` which has the same issue.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    if len(y_true.shape) > 1:
        y_true = K.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```

In this corrected version, we first check if the shape of `y_true` has more than 1 dimension. If so, we squeeze the tensor to ensure it has the correct shape for further processing. This fix addresses the bug and ensures that the calculation of `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` is done correctly.
