Potential error location: The `build` function within the `StackedRNNCells` class.

Reasons for the bug: The bug is caused because the `build` function is modifying the input_shape variable within a loop, which could lead to unexpected behaviors and errors.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Create a new variable to store the modified input_shape instead of modifying the input_shape variable directly.
2. Use a list to store the modified input shapes to ensure that all modified shapes are captured.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` function:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    modified_input_shapes = []
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        modified_input_shapes.append((input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim))
    self.built = True
```
