The error occurs at the line `assert len(input_shape) == 2` inside the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class. The input shape has a length of 3, causing the assertion to fail.

The bug occurs because the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class assumes that the input shape only has two dimensions, which is not the case in the provided test function.

To fix this bug, the `build` method should be modified to handle input shapes with a length other than 2. One way to achieve this is to adjust the logic within the `build` method to generalize the processing of input shapes with different lengths.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    self.input_dim = input_shape[-1]
    self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(self.input_dim, self.units),
                                  initializer='uniform',
                                  name='kernel')
    self.recurrent_kernel = self.add_weight(
        shape=(self.units, self.units),
        initializer='uniform',
        name='recurrent_kernel')
    self.built = True
```

This modified code removes the assertion on the length of the input shape and instead directly captures the input dimension, which is the last element of the input shape. This approach allows the `build` method to handle input shapes with varying lengths.
