The error here seems to stem from the fact that the input_shape tuple has a length of 3 instead of 2, as the error message indicates.

The buggy function is responsible for manipulating the input_shape tuple and setting some internal attributes accordingly.

It's likely that the function isn't correctly handling the input_shape modification, leading to an incorrect assertion.

To fix this, we can modify the function to correctly handle the input_shape modification and ensure that the assertion checks for the correct conditions.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)  # Adjusting input_shape here
    self.built = True
```

In this corrected code, we adjust the `input_shape` tuple on each iteration of the loop, focusing only on the first two elements to ensure it retains a length of 2. This fix should address the issue with the buggy function and prevent the assertion error seen in the test case.
