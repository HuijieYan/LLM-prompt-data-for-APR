The error message indicates that the input shape being passed to the `MinimalRNNCell` layer is of shape (None, 5, 8), and the build function of the `MinimalRNNCell` layer is asserting that the input shape should have length 2, which is not the case.

The issue is with the `StackedRNNCells` class. In the `build` function, the `input_shape` is not being updated correctly after iterating through the cells, leading to an incorrect assertion in the `MinimalRNNCell` build function.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `input_shape` inside the loop after computing the `output_dim` for each cell.

The corrected code for the `build` method of the `StackedRNNCells` class is as follows:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

By updating the `input_shape` inside the loop after computing the `output_dim`, we ensure that the input shape is correctly modified for each cell, resolving the bug.
