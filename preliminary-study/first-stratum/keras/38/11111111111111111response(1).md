The bug is occurring in the `build` method of the `StackedRNNCells` class. The method is attempting to build the cells and modify the `input_shape` based on the `state_size` of the cells, but it is not handling the dimensions of the `input_shape` correctly. 

The error message indicates that there is an assertion error in the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class, which is called within the `StackedRNNCells` class. The error specifically states that the input_shape has a length of 3 instead of 2, which is expected.

To fix this issue, the `build` method in `StackedRNNCells` should correctly handle the dimensions of `input_shape` and update it based on the `state_size` of the cells.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` method:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        # Update input_shape based on output_dim
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

This code ensures that the `input_shape` is updated correctly based on the `state_size` of the cells and should resolve the assertion error in the test case.
