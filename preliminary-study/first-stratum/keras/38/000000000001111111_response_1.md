The potential error in the function is with the condition `if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__')`. This condition is attempting to check if the `state_size` attribute of the `cell` has a length, but it is not the correct way to check the length of the attribute. 

The `state_size` attribute may not have the `__len__` method, which is causing the AttributeError. Instead, we should directly check if the `state_size` is an iterable (list, tuple, etc.) and then proceed accordingly.

Additionally, the loop is modifying the `input_shape` for each cell, which may not be the intended behavior. It should only be modified once for all cells.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    output_dim = 0
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell, 'state_size') and hasattr(cell.state_size, '__iter__'):
            output_dim += cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim += cell.state_size
    self.built = True
    input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
```
