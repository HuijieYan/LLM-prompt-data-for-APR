Potential error location: The code is trying to access `cell.state_size` without checking if it exists, which can cause an AttributeError.

Reasons behind the bug: The code does not handle the case where `cell.state_size` does not exist, leading to a potential AttributeError when trying to access its attributes.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Check if `cell.state_size` exists before trying to access its attributes.

Corrected code:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell, 'state_size'):
            if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
                output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
            else:
                output_dim = cell.state_size
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
