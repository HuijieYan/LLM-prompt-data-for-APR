Potential error location: The logic for updating the input_shape inside the for loop seems incorrect, as it is updating the input_shape based on the state_size of the cells without considering the type of cell.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: 
1. The code does not check if the cell is an instance of Layer before calling cell.build(input_shape), which can lead to errors if the cell is not a Layer object.
2. The logic for updating the input_shape inside the for loop is also incorrect as it does not handle the case where the cell.state_size is not iterable.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the cell is an instance of Layer before calling cell.build(input_shape).
2. Update the input_shape based on the cell.state_size in a way that handles both iterable and non-iterable state_size.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
            if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
                output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
            else:
                output_dim = cell.state_size
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
