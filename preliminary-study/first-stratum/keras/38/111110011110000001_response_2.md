The error message indicates that there is an assertion error in the `MinimalRNNCell` class's `build` function. The assertion is checking the length of the input shape to be 2, but it's being passed a shape of (None, 5, 8), hence the assertion error.

The potential error location is in the `build` function of `MinimalRNNCell`.

The bug occurred because the `build` function in the `MinimalRNNCell` class expects input shapes with a length of 2, but when it is called from the `recurrent.RNN` class, it's passing an input shape with a length of 3.

To fix this, the `build` function should be modified to handle input shapes of length 3, taking into consideration the temporal dimension.

Below is the corrected code for the `build` function in the `MinimalRNNCell` class:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    # This layer only deals with the temporal dimension and the last dimension corresponding to input features
    assert len(input_shape) == 3
    self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                  initializer='uniform',
                                  name='kernel')
    self.recurrent_kernel = self.add_weight(
        shape=(self.units, self.units),
        initializer='uniform',
        name='recurrent_kernel')
    self.built = True
```

In the corrected code, the `build` function now checks for an input shape of length 3, indicating that it takes into account the temporal dimension. The rest of the code inside the `build` function remains the same.
