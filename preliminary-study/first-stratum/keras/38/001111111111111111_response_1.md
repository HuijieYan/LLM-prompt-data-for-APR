The error message is pointing to the `assert len(input_shape) == 2` line within the `build` function of the `MinimalRNNCell` class. This assertion is failing because the input shape has three dimensions instead of two.

The bug is occurring because the `build` function of the `MinimalRNNCell` class is not handling the input shape correctly, and the input shape being passed to it has three dimensions instead of the expected two dimensions.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `build` function of the `MinimalRNNCell` class to handle input shapes with three dimensions. The input shape represents the shape of the data that the layer will process, and in the case of RNN cells, it should be `(batch_size, timesteps, input_dim)`.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` function of the `MinimalRNNCell` class:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    # input_shape: (batch_size, timesteps, input_dim)
    assert len(input_shape) == 3  # Ensure the input shape has three dimensions
    self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                  initializer='uniform',
                                  name='kernel')
    self.recurrent_kernel = self.add_weight(
        shape=(self.units, self.units),
        initializer='uniform',
        name='recurrent_kernel')
    self.built = True
```

With this modification, the `build` function will correctly handle input shapes with three dimensions, ensuring that the assertion does not fail.

Additionally, the previous bug in the `StackedRNNCells` class's `build` function is addressed by updating the code as follows:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]  # Assuming state_size is a tuple
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

The bug was related to the incorrect handling of `cell.state_size`. With these changes, the function will correctly assign `output_dim` based on the state size of the RNN cells.

These corrections should address the bugs identified in the provided code.
