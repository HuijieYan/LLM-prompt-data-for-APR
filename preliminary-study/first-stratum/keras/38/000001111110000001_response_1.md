The error message is from the test_minimal_rnn_cell_layer() test function, specifically from the call to the recurrent.RNN(cells) layer. It seems that the error occurs because the input_shape passed to the RNN cell is of shape (None, 5, 8) which violates the assertion len(input_shape) == 2 inside the MinimalRNNCell's build() method.

The bug is located in the build() method of the RNN class within recurrent.py. The problem arises from the incorrect handling of input_shape inside the build() method. The code attempts to modify the input_shape based on the state_size of the RNN cells, but the modification logic is faulty, leading to incorrect input_shape that violates the assertion inside the MinimalRNNCell's build() method when used in the test case.

To fix the bug, the input_shape adjustment logic inside the build() method of the RNN class needs to be corrected. The input_shape should be adjusted based on the state_size of the RNN cells in a way that does not violate the constraints of the individual cell's build() methods.

Here's the corrected code for the build() method:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)

    # Ensure that the input_shape only has 2 dimensions
    input_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    self.built = True
```

With this correction, the input_shape will be adjusted based on the state_size of the RNN cells without violating any constraints, and the error encountered in the test case should be resolved.
