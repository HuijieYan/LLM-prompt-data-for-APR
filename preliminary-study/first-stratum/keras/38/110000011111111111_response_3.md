The error occurs during the function `build` of the class `MinimalRNNCell`. The function is intended to build the RNN cell, including adding weights. It checks the length of `input_shape` and asserts that it should be 2. However, in the buggy function, there is a part where it tries to modify `input_shape` based on the cell's state size.

The issue is that the logic for modifying `input_shape` based on the cell's state size is incorrect. The code attempts to modify `input_shape` based on the assumption that `cell.state_size` may have a length or it's just an integer value, but this logic is flawed and it's causing the error.

One approach to fixing this bug is to remove the logic that tries to modify `input_shape` based on the cell's state size. It's not necessary to modify `input_shape` within the loop. Instead, the modification should happen only once, based on the final `output_dim`. Additionally, it would be better to use a simple if-else statement to handle the case where `cell.state_size` is an integer, rather than using `hasattr` to check if it has a length.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` function:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    output_dim = 0
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        output_dim = cell.state_size if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__') else cell.state_size
    input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

In this corrected code, `output_dim` is updated in each iteration of the loop, and then the final `input_shape` is modified based on the final `output_dim` value.
