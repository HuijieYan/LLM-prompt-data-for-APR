The potential error in the given code is that the function "build" is being defined multiple times in the same file. This will cause issues as Python will only consider the last definition of the function, leading to the loss of the previous definitions.

The bug in the code is that the "cell.state_size" attribute is being incorrectly accessed inside the loop. The code is assuming that "state_size" is an attribute of "cell", but it is not being accessed correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the "cell" has the attribute "state_size" using the hasattr function and then perform the necessary actions accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the "build" function:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell, 'state_size') and hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
