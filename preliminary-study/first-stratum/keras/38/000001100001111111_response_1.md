The potential error location is the `build` function inside the `StackedRNNCells` class. The error occurs due to the improper handling of the `cell.state_size` attribute and its corresponding `output_dim` calculation.

The bug occurs because the code checks if `cell.state_size` has a length, and if it does, it takes the first element as `output_dim`. However, this approach is not valid for all types of state sizes.

To fix the bug, we can modify the code to handle the `cell.state_size` attribute appropriately. We should check if it's an integer, and if not, we should assume it's a sequence and take the first element as `output_dim`.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` function:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell, 'state_size'):
            state_size = cell.state_size
            if isinstance(state_size, (list, tuple)):
                output_dim = state_size[0]
            else:
                output_dim = state_size
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

This code first checks if the `cell.state_size` attribute exists for the current `cell`. If it does, it then checks whether `state_size` is a list or tuple. If it is, it takes the first element as `output_dim`. Otherwise, it assumes `state_size` is an integer, and uses it as `output_dim`. Finally, it updates the `input_shape` and sets `self.built` to `True` once the loop completes.
