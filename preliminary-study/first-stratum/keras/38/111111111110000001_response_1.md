The error occurs when a test case is trying to run the `test_minimal_rnn_cell_layer()` function. Within this function, instances of the `MinimalRNNCell` class are being used to create an `RNN` layer. The error message indicates that there is an assertion error during the test, specifically within the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class. The error originates from the assertion `assert len(input_shape) == 2`, where the length of the `input_shape` is expected to be 2, but it is actually 3.

This error indicates that the `input_shape` being passed to the `build` method is not in the expected format, causing the assertion to fail. 

To fix this issue, the `build` method of the `StackedRNNCells` class needs to be corrected. The issue is that the `build` method is being defined multiple times in the original code, thus only the last definition of the method is actually used. To fix this issue, all the logic for building the RNN cells should be incorporated into a single `build` method.

The corrected code for the `build` method of the `StackedRNNCells` class is as follows:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

By consolidating the logic into a single `build` method, the bug in the original implementation is fixed. Now the `build` method of the `StackedRNNCells` class will properly process the `input_shape` and build the RNN cells accordingly.
