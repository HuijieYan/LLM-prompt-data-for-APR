The error message indicates an assertion error in the `build` function of the `MinimalRNNCell` class. The error occurs when the input shape is checked to ensure that it has no time axis.

The potential error in the `build` function of the `StackedRNNCells` class is with the lines:
```python
if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
    output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
else:
    output_dim = cell.state_size
```
The error is occurring because `cell.state_size` is not a valid attribute or does not have the expected type, leading to the assertion error in the test case.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `build` method of the `StackedRNNCells` as follows:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    output_shapes = []
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
            output_shapes.append(cell.compute_output_shape(input_shape))
        else:
            raise ValueError('Invalid cell type. Cell should be an instance of Layer.')
    self.output_dim = output_shapes[-1][-1]
    self.built = True
```

In this fixed version, the `build` method should iterate through each cell in `self.cells`, calling the `build` method for each cell and appending the output shape to `output_shapes`. Then, it will set the `output_dim` attribute to the last value of the output shapes.

This modification ensures that each cell's `build` method is called to properly define the cell's attributes, and it also sets the `output_dim` attribute based on the output shapes of all cells in the stacked configuration.
