The bug is likely occurring in the for loop within the build method. The issue stems from the use of cell.state_size as an attribute, as it should be accessed as a method instead.

When accessing cell.state_size, it should be called as a method of the 'cell' object, but the existing code is treating it as an attribute. This is causing an AttributeError when the code attempts to check if cell.state_size has the attribute '__len__'.

To fix this issue, the cell.state_size attribute should be called as a method. We can achieve this by replacing the line:
if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):

With:
if hasattr(cell, 'state_size') and callable(getattr(cell, 'state_size')):

This will ensure that cell.state_size is accessed correctly and that the program no longer throws an AttributeError.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected function
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell, 'state_size') and callable(getattr(cell, 'state_size')):
            if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
                output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
            else:
                output_dim = cell.state_size
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
