The problem is occurring in the build function of the StackedRNNCells class. The build function iterates over each cell in self.cells and attempts to build it using the input_shape. However, there is an issue with how the state_size is being handled. 

The bug occurs because the build function does not handle the state_size attribute properly. 

To fix this issue, we need to modify the logic for extracting the output_dim from the cell.state_size. We can use the isinstance function to check if cell.state_size is a list and extract the first element as the output_dim. If it's not a list, we can directly use it as the output_dim.

Here's the corrected code for the build function:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        
        if hasattr(cell, 'state_size'):
            if isinstance(cell.state_size, list):
                output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
            else:
                output_dim = cell.state_size
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
