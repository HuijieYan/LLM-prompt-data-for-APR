The error message indicates that there is an assertion error at line 521 in the `test_minimal_rnn_cell_layer` test case. The line `assert len(input_shape) == 2` is failing because the `input_shape` passed to the RNN cell is of length 3 instead of 2.

The bug is likely occurring inside the `build` method of the RNN cell because the `input_shape` is being modified in an unexpected way, resulting in the assertion failure. The modification of `input_shape` inside the loop in the `build` method seems to be causing the issue.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to create a new variable to store the modified `input_shape` instead of directly modifying the `input_shape` parameter. This will ensure that the original `input_shape` remains intact and the modifications do not affect the assertions made later in the code.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` method:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    updated_input_shape = input_shape  # Create a new variable to store the modified input_shape
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(updated_input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        updated_input_shape = (updated_input_shape[0], updated_input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

By using the `updated_input_shape` variable, the original `input_shape` is not directly modified, thus preventing unexpected changes that could lead to assertion errors.
