Potential error location: The error may be occurring in the line `if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__')`, which is checking the length of `cell.state_size`.

Reason for the bug: The bug is likely related to the condition `if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__')`, as it is checking if `cell.state_size` has a length. However, `cell.state_size` might be a property or method that does not support the `__len__` attribute.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if `cell.state_size` is a list or tuple before attempting to access its length.
2. Use a try-except block to handle cases where `__len__` attribute cannot be accessed.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if isinstance(cell.state_size, (list, tuple)):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
