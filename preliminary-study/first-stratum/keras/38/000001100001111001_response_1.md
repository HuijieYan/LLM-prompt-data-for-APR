There is an issue with the implementation of the `build` method. The function iterates over the cells, builds each cell, and then updates the input_shape. However, there are multiple build methods defined for the same class, which is incorrect. The if condition to check if the cell is an instance of Layer should also be corrected.

Here's the corrected implementation of the `build` method:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell, 'state_size'):
            if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
                output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
            else:
                output_dim = cell.state_size
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
