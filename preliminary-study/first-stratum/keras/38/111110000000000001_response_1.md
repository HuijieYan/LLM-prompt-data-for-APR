Potential error location: The error may be in the line `if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__')`.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The code is trying to check if the `cell.state_size` attribute has a length using the `__len__` method, but it's not doing so correctly. 

Approach for fixing the bug: We can modify the code to correctly check if `cell.state_size` is iterable.

Corrected code:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell, 'state_size'):
            if isinstance(cell.state_size, (list, tuple)):
                output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
            else:
                output_dim = cell.state_size
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
