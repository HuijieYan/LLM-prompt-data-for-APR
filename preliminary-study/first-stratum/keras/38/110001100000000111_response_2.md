The potential error location within the problematic function is the `if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__')` condition. This condition is trying to check if `cell.state_size` has a length attribute, but it should be checking if `cell.state_size` is a tuple or list instead.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__')` condition is not correctly checking the type of `cell.state_size`. Also, the code is not handling the case when `cell.state_size` is not a tuple or list, which could lead to potential errors.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the condition to check if `cell.state_size` is a tuple or list, and handle the case when it is not a tuple or list.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if isinstance(cell.state_size, (list, tuple)):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
