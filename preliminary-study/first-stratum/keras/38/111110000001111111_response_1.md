The issue in the `build` function is that it is not properly updating the `input_shape` for each cell in the `self.cells` list. Additionally, the condition for checking the length of `cell.state_size` is not being handled correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to iterate through each cell in `self.cells`, update the `input_shape` based on the `state_size` of each cell, and set `self.built` to `True` at the end.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` function:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)  # Update input_shape
    self.built = True
```

With this correction, the `input_shape` will be properly updated for each cell in the `self.cells` list, and the `self.built` flag will be set to `True` once the function has completed its execution.
