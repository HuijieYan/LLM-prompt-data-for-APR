The issue lies in the `build` method of the `StackedRNNCells` class. The code attempts to loop through each cell in `self.cells`, update `input_shape`, and set `self.built` to True. However, it incorrectly calculates the `input_shape` and the condition for setting `output_dim` is also incorrect.

To fix the bug, let's update the `build` method to properly calculate `input_shape` and set `output_dim` based on the state size of the cell.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` method:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
            output_dim = cell.state_size
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

In the corrected code, `output_dim` is set using `cell.state_size` directly, and `input_shape` is updated inside the loop based on the state size of the cell. This will correctly calculate `input_shape` and set `output_dim` for each cell in `self.cells` before setting `self.built` to True.
