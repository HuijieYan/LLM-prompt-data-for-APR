The bug in the provided function is related to the conditional statements. 

When the loop iterates over the cells, it checks if the current cell is an instance of Layer and builds it accordingly. However, the subsequent conditional statement does not properly handle the state size of the cell.

To fix this bug, the conditional statement should be nested under the first if statement to only execute when the current cell is an instance of Layer. Additionally, it's recommended to use an else statement to cover the scenario when the cell is not an instance of Layer.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
            if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
                output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
            else:
                output_dim = cell.state_size
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

By placing the second conditional statement inside the first if block, the code will now correctly handle the state size of the cell in the context of being a Layer instance.
