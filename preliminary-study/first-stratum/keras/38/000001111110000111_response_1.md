The error occurs in the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class. When the `build` method is called, it checks the length of the `input_shape` and throws an assertion error because the actual length is 3, not 2.

This issue occurs because the `input_shape` is a 3D tensor (None, 5, 8), where the first dimension represents the batch size and is set to None. The second dimension is the time steps, and the third dimension is the number of features.

To fix this issue, the `build` method should be modified to handle 3D tensors and remove the assertion for the input shape length.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` method in the `MinimalRNNCell` class:

```python
class MinimalRNNCell(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        self.units = units
        self.state_size = units
        super(MinimalRNNCell, self).__init__(**kwargs)

    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                      initializer='uniform',
                                      name='kernel')
        self.recurrent_kernel = self.add_weight(
            shape=(self.units, self.units),
            initializer='uniform',
            name='recurrent_kernel')
        self.built = True
```

By removing the assertion and directly building the weights based on the input shape, the build method now correctly handles 3D input shapes.
