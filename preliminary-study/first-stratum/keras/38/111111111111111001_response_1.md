The error occurs during the testing of the `MinimalRNNCell` class. The call to the `recurrent.RNN(cells)` with multiple `MinimalRNNCell` instances seems to trigger the error related to the build method of the RNN cells.

The potential error location within the problematic function is:
```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    # ... omitted code ...
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

The bug seems to be related to the conditional statement `if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__')`, which might not be working correctly, resulting in the assertion error when the input shape is checked to have length 2.

To fix the bug, we need to determine the correct way to handle the `state_size` and `output_dim` computation and assignment within the loop for the RNN cells. Possibly, the `state_size` check and assignment logic needs to be modified.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    # ... omitted code ...
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell, 'state_size'):
            if isinstance(cell.state_size, int):
                output_dim = cell.state_size
            elif isinstance(cell.state_size, (list, tuple)):
                output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the `cell` object has the attribute `state_size`. Then, based on the type of `state_size`, we assign the `output_dim` accordingly and update the `input_shape` within the loop. This should resolve the assertion error and handle the RNN cells effectively.
