The error occurs when the function `build` in the class `StackedRNNCells` is called. This function attempts to build each cell in `self.cells` and update `input_shape` accordingly. However, the code crashes because it is assuming the input shape has a time axis, which is not always the case.

To fix this bug, the function needs to be modified to handle input shapes with varying dimensions. One approach is to check the dimensionality of the input shape and adjust the logic accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` method:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)

        # Update input_shape if state_size is available
        if hasattr(cell, 'state_size'):
            if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
                output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
            else:
                output_dim = cell.state_size
            if len(input_shape) == 3:
                input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
            else:
                input_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)
    
    self.built = True
```

In this corrected version, we first check if the state_size attribute is available for the cell. If it is, we update the input_shape conditionally based on the dimensionality of the input shape. This modification ensures that the function can handle input shapes with or without a time axis.
