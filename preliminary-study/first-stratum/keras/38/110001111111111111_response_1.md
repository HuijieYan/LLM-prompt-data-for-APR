The error message indicates that the assertion `assert len(input_shape) == 2` is failing, which suggests that the function is expecting `input_shape` to have length 2, but it actually has length 3.

The issue in the provided code is that the `build` method is modifying `input_shape` within a loop, thus leading to the incorrect assertion.

To fix this issue, we should not modify the `input_shape` within the loop in the `build` method. Instead, we can store the modified shapes in a separate variable and use that variable for further computation.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    modified_input_shapes = []
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
        modified_input_shapes.append(input_shape)  # Store the modified shapes
    self.built = True
```

By storing the modified shapes in the `modified_input_shapes` list and using `input_shape` as a temporary variable within the loop, we avoid modifying the `input_shape` that is passed as the argument to the `build` method. This should resolve the issue and the assertion should no longer fail.
