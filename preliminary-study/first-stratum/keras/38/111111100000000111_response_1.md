Potential error location: The error occurs within the build method of the StackedRNNCells class. More specifically, the issue lies in the loop where it iterates through the cells and attempts to obtain the state size.

Reason behind the bug: The bug occurs because the code does not properly handle the case when cell.state_size is a list or a single value. This inconsistency in handling different types of cell.state_size leads to the error.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the different types of cell.state_size. If it's a list, we need to extract the first element as the output_dim, and if it's a single value, we can directly use it as the output_dim.

Corrected code:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
