The error occurs when the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class is called, and it asserts that the length of the `input_shape` is equal to 2, which is not the case (it is 3).

The bug is occurring in the `build` method of the `StackedRNNCells` class. The `for` loop inside the `build` method is attempting to modify `input_shape` by updating its value based on the `state_size` of each cell in the list `self.cells`. However, the `input_shape` is a tuple and should not be modified in this way.

To fix this bug:
1. We should create a new variable to store the updated input shape.
2. Use a temporary variable `new_input_shape` to store the updated shape. Initialize it with `input_shape`.
3. Use `new_input_shape` for all subsequent operations, instead of modifying `input_shape` directly.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    new_input_shape = input_shape  # Initialize new_input_shape with input_shape
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(new_input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        new_input_shape = (new_input_shape[0], new_input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

By making these changes, we ensure that the original `input_shape` tuple is not modified, while still updating the shape as intended.
