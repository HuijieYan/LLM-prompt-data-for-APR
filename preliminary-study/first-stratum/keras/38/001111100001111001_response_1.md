The issue with the provided code is that there are several functions with the same name "build" within the "StackedRNNCells" class, causing conflicts and ambiguity. Additionally, the logic within the "build" function seems to be incorrect as it iterates over the cells and updates the input shape, but it doesn't handle the state sizes correctly.

To fix the bug, the "build" function needs to be refactored to correctly handle the state sizes and built status of the RNN cells.

Here's the corrected code for the "build" function:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
            if hasattr(cell, 'state_size'):
                state_sizes = getattr(cell, 'state_size')
                if isinstance(state_sizes, (list, tuple)):
                    output_dim = state_sizes[0]
                else:
                    output_dim = state_sizes
            else:
                output_dim = 0
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

In this corrected code, we first check if the cell has the attribute "state_size". If it does, we correctly handle both the cases of "state_size" being a single value or a list/tuple of values. We then update the input shape accordingly.

This should resolve the issues with the original implementation and provide the expected functionality for the "build" method within the "StackedRNNCells" class.
