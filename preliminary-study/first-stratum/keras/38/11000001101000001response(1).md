Based on the test case provided, the bug occurs in the `build` method of the `StackedRNNCells` class. The error message showing the problematic function and its usage suggests that the issue originates from the `build` method when dealing with the `cells` attribute.

The bug occurs because of the misuse of the `cell.state_size` attribute. It attempts to treat `cell.state_size` as an iterable that has a length, which might not always be the case.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `cell.state_size` is iterable using the `hasattr` function. If it is iterable, we can take the first element as the `output_dim`; otherwise, we can directly use `cell.state_size` as the `output_dim`.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` method:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__') and len(cell.state_size) > 0:
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
        
    self.built = True
```

In the corrected code, we first check if `cell.state_size` is iterable and has a length greater than 0. If true, we take the first element as `output_dim`; otherwise, we directly use `cell.state_size` as `output_dim`. This approach handles both iterable and non-iterable cases for `cell.state_size`.
