Potential Error Location: The error occurs in the build method of the StackedRNNCells class.

Reason for the Bug: The build method has a logical error in handling the cell state size. The code mistakenly uses cell.state_size as if it were a property or method, which can cause a AttributeError.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: We should check if cell.state_size is a property or method and handle it accordingly. Additionally, we should correctly update the input_shape with the output_dim.

Corrected Code:
```python
# this is the corrected version of the build function
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell, 'state_size') and callable(getattr(cell, 'state_size')):
            state_size = cell.state_size()
            if isinstance(state_size, (list, tuple)):
                output_dim = state_size[0]
            else:
                output_dim = state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
