Potential error location: 

The potential error is in the for loop in the `build` method where it iterates over `self.cells` and sets the `output_dim` based on the `state_size` of each cell. 

Reasons behind the bug:

1. The code doesn't handle the case when `cell.state_size` is a list, which leads to an error when trying to access `cell.state_size[0]` without checking if it's a list first.
2. The code doesn't handle the case when `cell.state_size` is a single value, which would also lead to an error when trying to access `cell.state_size[0]`.

Approaches 

1. Check if `cell.state_size` is a list and then access the first element.
2. If `cell.state_size` is not a list, directly use the `cell.state_size` value.

Corrected code:
```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0] if isinstance(cell.state_size, list) else cell.state_size
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
