The potential error location within the problematic function is the `build` method. The error occurs because the method is iterating through `self.cells` without proper handling of any potential exceptions.

The error occurs because the code is trying to access the `state_size` attribute of `cell` without checking if `cell` has the `state_size` attribute or not. This can lead to a `AttributeError` if `cell` does not have a `state_size` attribute.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `cell` has the `state_size` attribute before accessing it. Additionally, we need to handle the case where `cell.state_size` is not a sequence.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` method:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell, 'state_size'):
            if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
                output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
            else:
                output_dim = cell.state_size
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

By adding the `hasattr(cell, 'state_size')` check, we ensure that we only access the `state_size` attribute if it exists. This prevents potential `AttributeError` from occurring. Additionally, we handle the case where `cell.state_size` is not a sequence by checking its length before accessing its elements.
