The error occurs when trying to compare 3 and 2, which indicates that the expected result is 3 but the actual result is 2.

Looking into the provided code, the issue seems to be with the `build` method of a `StackedRNNCells` class in Keras. The `build` method is supposed to initialize the cells and input shape, but the current implementation is incorrect.

The problem arises from the loop inside the `build` method that iterates over `self.cells` and tries to get the `state_size` attribute from each cell. This can lead to potential AttributeError if the `state_size` attribute does not exist. Additionally, the `output_dim` calculation seems flawed.

To fix this issue, the `build` method should be adjusted to handle different cases where `state_size` may or may not exist in the cells properly and calculate `output_dim` accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `build` method:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell, 'state_size'):
            if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
                output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
            else:
                output_dim = cell.state_size
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

By handling the `state_size` attribute with `hasattr()` and calculating `output_dim` based on its presence, the potential AttributeError and incorrect `output_dim` calculation issues can be resolved.

With this fix, the `build` method should work as expected, and the test case should pass successfully.
