Potential Error Location:
The potential error is in the if statement checking if the cell has a state_size attribute.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the code assumes that all cells have a state_size attribute, which may not be the case for all types of cells.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
We can fix the bug by checking if the cell has a state_size attribute before accessing it.

Corrected Code:
```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        
        if hasattr(cell, 'state_size'):
            if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
                output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
            else:
                output_dim = cell.state_size
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
