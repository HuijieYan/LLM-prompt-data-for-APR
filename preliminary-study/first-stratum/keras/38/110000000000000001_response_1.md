Potential Error Location:
The issue lies within the if statement `if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__')`, as it is checking if the cell's state_size attribute has a length. If it does, it assumes output_dim to be the first element of state_size; otherwise, it assigns output_dim the entire state_size value.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug occurs because isinstance() is used in the wrong place. It should be used to check if the cell is an instance of a Layer, and if it is, then build it. The hasattr() check is also incorrect as it should be used to determine if state_size is an attribute of the cell, not if it has a length.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if cell is an instance of a Layer, and build it accordingly.
2. Use a try-except block to handle the AttributeError that occurs when state_size is not an attribute of the cell.
3. Properly update the input_shape based on the output_dim of the cell.

Corrected Code:
```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0] if hasattr(cell, 'state_size') and hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__') else cell.state_size
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
