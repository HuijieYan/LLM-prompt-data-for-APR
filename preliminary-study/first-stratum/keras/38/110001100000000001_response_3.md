Potential error location: The if statement `if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):` seems to be causing the issue.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `hasattr` function in the if statement is checking if the `cell.state_size` has a length attribute, which may not be the correct way to determine the shape of the state size.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: It seems like the intention of the if statement is to handle cases where `cell.state_size` is an array or a single value. It would be better to use `isinstance` check to determine if `cell.state_size` is an array or not.

Corrected code:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if isinstance(cell.state_size, (list, tuple)):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
