Potential Error Location: 

The potential error location is within the `build` method of the class. There are multiple `build` methods defined in the snippet, making it hard to determine which one is causing the issue.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug: 

The bug occurred due to the multiple `build` methods defined with the same name. This leads to ambiguity and can cause unexpected behavior when the class is instantiated.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:

1. Remove the duplicate `build` methods and keep only one `build` method in the class.
2. Ensure that the `build` method takes the correct parameters and implements the necessary logic for building the class.

Corrected Code:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
        for cell in self.cells:
            if isinstance(cell, Layer):
                cell.build(input_shape)
            if hasattr(cell, 'state_size') and hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
                output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
            else:
                output_dim = cell.state_size
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
        self.built = True
```
