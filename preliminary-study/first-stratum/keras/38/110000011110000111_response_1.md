The error message indicates that the assertion `assert len(input_shape) == 2` within the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class is failing. This is because the input shape being passed to the method has a length of 3 instead of 2.

The bug is occurring because the `build` method is expecting a 2D input shape, but the actual input shape has three dimensions, leading to the failure of the assertion.

To fix this bug, the `build` method should handle input shapes with any number of dimensions. This can be achieved by modifying the logic within the `build` method to dynamically extract the relevant input shape dimensions.

Here's the corrected `build` method for the `MinimalRNNCell` class:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    # Extract the number of dimensions in the input shape
    input_dim = input_shape[-1]
    
    self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(input_dim, self.units),
                                  initializer='uniform',
                                  name='kernel')
    self.recurrent_kernel = self.add_weight(
        shape=(self.units, self.units),
        initializer='uniform',
        name='recurrent_kernel')
    self.built = True
```

In this corrected version, the `build` method extracts the last dimension of the input shape and uses it to define the shape of the `kernel` weight. This modification ensures that the method can handle input shapes with any number of dimensions, resolving the bug.
