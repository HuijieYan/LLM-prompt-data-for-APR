The error occurs in the `MinimalRNNCell` class, specifically in the `build` method. The test case specifies an input shape of `(None, 5)`, which has a length of 3, but the `build` method asserts that the length should be 2. This inconsistency causes the assertion error.

The bug occurs because the `build` method in the provided code for the `StackedRNNCells` class is not implemented correctly. The build method is supposed to initialize the weights of the cells and update the input shape, but it does not handle the cell's state size properly. Additionally, the function does not correctly update the input shape based on the output dimension of each cell.

To fix the bug, the `build` method needs to be updated to properly handle the state size and update the input shape based on the output dimensions of the cells.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` method in the `StackedRNNCells` class:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    self.built = True
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell, 'state_size'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size
            if hasattr(output_dim, '__len__'):
                output_dim = output_dim[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.output_dim
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
```

In this corrected function, the output dimension of each cell is properly used to update the input shape, and the condition for handling `state_size` is also fixed.
