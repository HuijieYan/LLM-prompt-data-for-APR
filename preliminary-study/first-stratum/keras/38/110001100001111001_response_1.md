The bug in the function `build` is likely due to the iteration over `self.cells` and the subsequent logic to build each cell. However, the error handling for the `cell.state_size` attribute seems to be incorrect.

The issue in the buggy function is with the handling of `cell.state_size`. It is unclear what the intent of this code is, but it seems that the logic to handle the `state_size` attribute is not correct.

To fix this bug, a better approach would be to check the type of `cell.state_size` and handle it accordingly. If `cell.state_size` is an integer, there is no need to check for length. We can directly use it to update the `input_shape`. If it is a list or tuple, we can extract the first element and use that to update the `input_shape`.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` function:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__') and len(cell.state_size) > 0:
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
            
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
        
    self.built = True
```

In this corrected code, we check if `cell` has a `state_size` attribute of length greater than 0. If it does, we use the first element as the `output_dim`. Otherwise, we directly use `cell.state_size` as the `output_dim`. Additionally, we update the `input_shape` using the calculated `output_dim`.
