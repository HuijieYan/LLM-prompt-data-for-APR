The error seems to be related to the `state_size` method in the `MinimalRNNCell` class. It appears that the `state_size` method is not defined correctly, which is causing the test to fail.

Upon analyzing the `MinimalRNNCell` class, it is evident that the `state_size` method is missing a proper implementation. The `state_size` method should return the size of the state, but it is currently missing a return statement that specifies the size.

To fix the bug, the `state_size` method needs to be modified to return the size of the state. Additionally, the `call` method in the `MinimalRNNCell` class should be updated to receive the `states` parameter as a tuple to match the shape of the output.

Here's the corrected code for the `MinimalRNNCell` class with the `state_size` and `call` methods fixed:

```python
class MinimalRNNCell(keras.layers.Layer):

    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        self.units = units
        super(MinimalRNNCell, self).__init__(**kwargs)

    def build(self, input_shape):
        # no time axis in the input shape passed to RNN cells
        assert len(input_shape) == 2

        self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                      initializer='uniform',
                                      name='kernel')
        self.recurrent_kernel = self.add_weight(
            shape=(self.units, self.units),
            initializer='uniform',
            name='recurrent_kernel')
        self.built = True

    def call(self, inputs, states):
        prev_output = states[0]
        h = keras.backend.dot(inputs, self.kernel)
        output = h + keras.backend.dot(prev_output, self.recurrent_kernel)
        return output, [output]

    def get_config(self):
        config = {'units': self.units}
        base_config = super(MinimalRNNCell, self).get_config()
        return dict(list(base_config.items()) + list(config.items()))

    def state_size(self):
        return self.units

```

With these changes, the `call` method now correctly receives `states` as a tuple, and the `state_size` method returns the size of the state.

This should resolve the error in the test case.
