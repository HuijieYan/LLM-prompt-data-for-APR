Potential error location: The error might be in the line `if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):` where the `state_size` attribute of the `cell` object is being checked for its length.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug occurs because the code is not handling the `state_size` attribute properly. The current implementation does not account for different types of `state_size` such as scalars, arrays, or other objects.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the type of `state_size` attribute before accessing its length.
2. Handle different types of `state_size` appropriately to ensure the code works for all cases.

Corrected code:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        
        state_size = cell.state_size
        if isinstance(state_size, list) or isinstance(state_size, tuple):
            output_dim = state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = state_size

        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
