The error message occurs at line 521 of the test function, which is within the build method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class. The error is caused by an assertion that checks the length of the input shape to be equal to 2.

The buggy function `build` is incorrectly updating the `input_shape` parameter within each iteration of the loop. This causes `input_shape` to become a tuple of shape (None, 5, 8), which leads to the assertion failure when it checks for a length of 2.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `input_shape` correctly within the loop and reassign it to the original `input_shape` variable at the end. This ensures that the input shape is modified as intended, without causing the assertion failure.

Here's the corrected implementation of the `build` method:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

With this corrected implementation, the input shape will be updated correctly within the loop without causing any assertion failures.
