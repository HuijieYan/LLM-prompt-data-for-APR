The problem with the provided code is that the `build` method of the `StackedRNNCells` class is defined multiple times in the source code. This will cause method overwriting and only the last defined `build` method will be considered. 

To fix the issue, the redundant or incorrect versions of the `build` method should be removed, and the correct version of the `build` method should be modified to handle the input cells and input_shape properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `StackedRNNCells` class with the `build` method fixed:

```python
class StackedRNNCells(Layer):
    """
    Wrapper allowing a stack of RNN cells to behave as a single cell.
    
    Used to implement efficient stacked RNNs.
    
    # Arguments
        cells: List of RNN cell instances.
    
    # Examples
    
    ```python
        cells = [
            keras.layers.LSTMCell(output_dim),
            keras.layers.LSTMCell(output_dim),
            keras.layers.LSTMCell(output_dim),
        ]
    
        inputs = keras.Input((timesteps, input_dim))
        x = keras.layers.RNN(cells)(inputs)
    ```
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    def build(self, input_shape):
        for cell in self.cells:
            if isinstance(cell, Layer):
                cell.build(input_shape)
            if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
                output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
            else:
                output_dim = cell.state_size
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
        self.built = True
```

The corrected code removes the redundant `build` methods and defines it only once for the `StackedRNNCells` class. It then loops through the input cells, calls the `build` method for each cell, and updates the input_shape. Finally, it sets `self.built` to True.

This should fix the bug and allow the `StackedRNNCells` class to work as intended.
