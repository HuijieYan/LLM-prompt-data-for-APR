The error occurs in the `build` method of the `StackedRNNCells` class. The loop in this method iterates through each cell in `self.cells`, attempting to build them and update the `input_shape` variable. However, the shapes are not being appropriately handled in this process.

The error message indicates that the variable `input_shape` has a length of 3 instead of the expected 2. This suggests that the dimensions are not being managed correctly during the `build` process of the cells.

To fix this bug, the dimensions of `input_shape` need to be updated in a way that reflects the stacked nature of the RNN cells. This can be achieved by modifying how `input_shape` is updated within the loop.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` method of the `StackedRNNCells` class:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        input_shape = cell.compute_output_shape(input_shape)  # Update input_shape based on the output shape of the cell
    self.built = True
```

In this corrected code, the `compute_output_shape` method is used to update the `input_shape` based on the output shape of the current cell. This ensures that the `input_shape` reflects the stacked nature of the RNN cells.
