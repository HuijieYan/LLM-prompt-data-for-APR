Potential Error Location:
The potential error is in the if statement `if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):`. The intention seems to be to check if the cell's state_size has a length, but the condition is incorrect.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the condition `if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):` checks if the cell's state_size attribute has a '__len__' attribute, which is not the correct way to check if it's iterable.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to check if the cell's state_size is iterable using the isinstance() function, instead of checking for the '__len__' attribute.

Corrected Code:
```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if isinstance(cell.state_size, (list, tuple)):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
