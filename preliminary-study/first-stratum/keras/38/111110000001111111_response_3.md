The buggy function is supposed to iterate over a list of RNN cell instances, build each cell, and update the input shape. However, there are two issues:
1. The `for` loop does not have a block defined, so only the first `if` condition applies to the loop. Subsequent code does not execute within the loop. This can lead to incorrect logic.
2. `cell.state_size` is accessed without proper validation for its existence, leading to potential errors if `cell.state_size` is not defined.

To fix this issue, the `for` loop should be correctly formatted to include all subsequent code. Additionally, the `cell.state_size` should be safely accessed to avoid potential errors.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` method:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    output_dim = None

    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell, 'state_size') and isinstance(cell.state_size, (list, tuple)):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)

    self.built = True
```

In the corrected code:
- The `for` loop incorporates all subsequent code within the loop.
- The `if` condition `hasattr(cell, 'state_size') and isinstance(cell.state_size, (list, tuple))` checks for the existence and type of `cell.state_size` before accessing its elements.
