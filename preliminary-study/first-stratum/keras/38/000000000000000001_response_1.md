Potential error location: 
The issue seems to be within the if statement for checking if cell.state_size has a length, as it is not properly indented to be within the isinstance check.

Reason for the bug:
The bug occurs because the if statement for checking the length of cell.state_size is not properly nested within the if statement for checking if cell is an instance of Layer. This causes the code to incorrectly handle the state_size attribute of the cell.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Indent the if statement for checking the length of cell.state_size so that it is properly nested within the if statement for checking if cell is an instance of Layer.
2. Add an else statement to handle the case where cell is not an instance of Layer, to ensure that the code does not try to access the state_size attribute.

Corrected code:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
            if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
                output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
            else:
                output_dim = cell.state_size
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
