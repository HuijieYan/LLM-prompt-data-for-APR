The error occurs when calling the `layer` object with input `x`, specifically when the `input_shape` is validated within the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class. The `assert` statement in the `build` method checks the length of the `input_shape` and raises an error because it seems to be expecting just two dimensions but is receiving three.

The issue could be due to the additional dimension that is being added during the processing of the `input_shape` in the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class. This could be because of the way the `StackedRNNCells` within the `cell` object are implemented and how they modify the `input_shape`.

To fix this issue, the additional dimension causing the `input_shape` to have three dimensions should be handled within the `build` method. The `input_shape` should be reshaped to have only two dimensions right before the `assert` statement.

Below is the corrected code:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[2])  # Reshape the input_shape to have only two dimensions
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)  # Update input_shape with the output_dim
    self.built = True
```

In this corrected code, the `input_shape` is reshaped to have only two dimensions before being used in the `assert` statement, resolving the error described in the test case.
