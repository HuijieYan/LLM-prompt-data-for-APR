The error occurs because the `state_size` attribute is treated as a method instead of a property. This is evident from the line `if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):` which checks if `state_size` has a `__len__` method, which is not the correct way to access the state size.

To fix the bug, you should directly access the `state_size` attribute of the `cell` object. Here's the corrected code for the `build` method:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        output_dim = cell.state_size[0] if hasattr(cell, 'state_size') and isinstance(cell.state_size, (list, tuple)) else cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

In the corrected code, we directly access the `state_size` attribute of the `cell` object. Additionally, we use `isinstance(cell.state_size, (list, tuple))` to check if `state_size` is a list or tuple before accessing its elements. This updated code should fix the bug and work as intended.
