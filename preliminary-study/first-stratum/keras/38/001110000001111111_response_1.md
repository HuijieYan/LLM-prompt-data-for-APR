The potential error in the provided function is in the build method. The error occurs because the input_shape is being modified in a way that is not consistent and could lead to unexpected results.

When the cell's state size has a length, the output_dim is set to the first element of the state size. Otherwise, output_dim is set to the state size itself. However, the input_shape is modified based on this output_dim value without considering the implications for the remaining cells in the list.

To fix this bug, we need to calculate the final output shape based on the state size of all cells in the list, rather than just the first one. This can be achieved by finding the maximum state size among all cells and using that to update the input_shape.

Here's the corrected code for the build method:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    output_dims = []
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dims.append(cell.state_size[0])
        else:
            output_dims.append(cell.state_size)
        
    output_dim = max(output_dims)
    input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    
    self.built = True
```

With this modification, the input_shape is updated based on the maximum state size among all cells in the list, ensuring consistency and correctness in the calculation.
