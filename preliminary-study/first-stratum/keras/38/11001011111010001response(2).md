1. The test case is testing the stacking of multiple MinimalRNNCell objects within a recurrent.RNN object. The error message indicates that an assertion error occurred, suggesting that the expected output did not match the actual output.

2. The potential error locations within the problematic function are the loop that iterates over self.cells and the conditional statement checking if the cell has a state_size.

3. The bug is likely caused by the loop that iterates over self.cells to build each cell. It's possible that the state_size attribute is not being handled correctly for each cell, leading to incorrect output dimensions.

4. To fix the bug, the build function should correctly handle the state_size attribute for each cell and adjust the input_shape accordingly.

5. Here's the corrected code for the build function:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell, 'state_size'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size
            if hasattr(output_dim, '__len__'):
                output_dim = output_dim[0]
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

In the corrected code, the conditional statement checks if the cell has a state_size attribute. If it does, the output_dim is set accordingly. Additionally, the input_shape is adjusted based on the output_dim for each cell.
