The buggy function `build` in the `StackedRNNCells` class is intended to build the stacked RNN cells by setting their input shape and marking the entire stack as "built". However, there are several issues with the current implementation.

Issues:
1. The `cells` attribute is accessed using `self.cells`, but it's not defined within the class. Instead, it should be accessed using the `cells` argument passed to the constructor.
2. The loop iterates over `self.cells`, but it's missing a check to ensure that `cells` is not `None`.
3. The logic to update `input_shape` based on the state size of the cells is incorrect.

Approach for fixing the bug:
1. Correctly access the `cells` attribute by using `cells` parameter passed to the constructor.
2. Add a check to ensure that `cells` is not `None` before iterating over it.
3. Update the logic to calculate the new `input_shape` based on the state size of the cells.

Here's the corrected `build` function:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    if self.cells is None:
        raise ValueError("Cannot build the stacked cells without providing cell instances.")
    
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        
        if hasattr(cell, 'state_size'):
            if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
                output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
            else:
                output_dim = cell.state_size
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
        else:
            raise ValueError("Cell instances must have a 'state_size' attribute.")
    
    self.built = True
```

In the corrected code:
- We added a check to ensure that `self.cells` is not None before iterating over it.
- We fixed the logic to calculate the new `input_shape` based on the state size of the cells.
- We added validation to ensure that cell instances have a `state_size` attribute.

These changes should address the issues present in the original code.
