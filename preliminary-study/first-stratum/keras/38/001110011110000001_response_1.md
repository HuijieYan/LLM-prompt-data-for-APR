The error occurs at the line `assert len(input_shape) == 2`, which is part of the `MinimalRNNCell` class. This error is due to the fact that the input shape passed to the `MinimalRNNCell` build method has a different length than expected.

The bug in the `StackedRNNCells` class's `build` method is that the variable `input_shape` is modified repeatedly inside the loop, which can lead to an incorrect input shape.

To fix the bug, we need to store the modified `input_shape` in a new variable, calculate the new `output_dim` for each cell, and then update `input_shape` with the new values without affecting the original `input_shape`.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` method of the `StackedRNNCells` class:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    modified_input_shape = input_shape  # Store the original input_shape

    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(modified_input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        modified_input_shape = (modified_input_shape[0], modified_input_shape[1], output_dim)

    self.built = True
```

With this modification, the original `input_shape` remains unchanged, and the modified input shape is used for each cell's `build` method.
