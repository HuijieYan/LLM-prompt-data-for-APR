The problematic code seems to be the `build` method inside the StackedRNNCells class which is part of the Keras library. 

The error occurs because the `build` method has several duplicate definitions which makes it unclear which definition is actually being used.

To fix the bug, the multiple duplicate definitions of the `build` method should be removed and only one should be kept which is intended to build the cell for StackedRNNCells.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` method:

```python
# this is the corrected build method
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

In this corrected code, all the duplicate definitions of the `build` method are removed and only one definition is kept in line with the purpose of building the StackedRNNCells.
