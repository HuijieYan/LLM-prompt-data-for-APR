Potential error location: The problematic part of the function is the loop that iterates through the cells and tries to build them.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. The function does not handle the case where `cell` is not an instance of `Layer`.
2. The variable `output_dim` is being reassigned in each iteration of the loop, which might not be the intended behavior.
3. If `cell.state_size` does not have the attribute `__len__`, then accessing `cell.state_size[0]` will result in an AttributeError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if `cell` is an instance of `Layer` before calling `cell.build(input_shape)`.
2. Use a separate variable to store the shape of the input and output instead of reassigning the `input_shape` variable inside the loop.
3. Use a try-except block to handle the case where `cell.state_size` does not have the attribute `__len__`.

Corrected code:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    output_shape = input_shape
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(output_shape)
            output_shape = cell.compute_output_shape(output_shape)
    
    self.built = True
```
