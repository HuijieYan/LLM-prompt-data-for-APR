The error occurs when the test case tries to build a stacked RNN with multiple MinimalRNNCell objects. The error message indicates a failed assertion within the `MinimalRNNCell` class's `build` method, specifically when checking the length of the `input_shape`.

The bug occurs because the assertion in the `MinimalRNNCell` class's `build` method expects the length of `input_shape` to be 2, while the input shape passed to the RNN cells has a length of 3 `(None, 5, 8)`.

To fix this bug, the `build` method in the `StackedRNNCells` class needs to be updated in order to correctly handle the input shape when iterating through the cells, modifying it to match the expected input for the `MinimalRNNCell` objects.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` method in the `StackedRNNCells` class:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
        for cell in self.cells:
            if isinstance(cell, Layer):
                # Adjust the input shape to match the expected input by the RNN cells
                # In this case, the input shape should not include the time axis
                cell.build((input_shape[0], input_shape[2]))
            if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
                output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
            else:
                output_dim = cell.state_size
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
        self.built = True
```

This modified `build` method correctly handles input shapes when iterating through the cells, allowing the `MinimalRNNCell` objects to build properly and eliminating the assertion error.
