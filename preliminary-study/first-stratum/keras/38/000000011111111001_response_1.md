The bug is in the `build` method of the `recurrent_test.test_minimal_rnn_cell_layer.<locals>.MinimalRNNCell` class. It seems that the input shape is having an extra dimension not accounted for in the assertion, leading to an assertion error.

The bug occurs because the input shape is being modified within the for loop in the `build` method, leading to incorrect shape dimensions when the `build` method is called for the `cell` objects. This causes the assertion `assert len(input_shape) == 2` to fail.

To fix this bug, a possible approach is to maintain the original input shape and create a separate variable to hold the modified shape dimensions. Then use the modified shape dimensions for subsequent calculations.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` method:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    modified_input_shape = input_shape  # Preserve original input shape
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(modified_input_shape)  # Use modified input shape here
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        modified_input_shape = (modified_input_shape[0], modified_input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

By making these changes, the modified input shape will be used for further calculations while preserving the original input shape for individual `cell` builds. This should resolve the assertion error.
