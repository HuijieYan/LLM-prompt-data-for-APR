The error message is occurring in the `test_minimal_rnn_cell_layer` test function. The error message suggests that the input shape being passed to the RNN cell has 3 dimensions instead of the expected 2 dimensions.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `build` method of the `StackedRNNCells` class. This method builds the stacked RNN cells by iterating through each cell, updating the input shape, and setting the attribute `self.built` to True.

The error occurs because the input_shape is being updated incorrectly, leading to the wrong input shape being used in subsequent cell builds. This results in an assertion error when comparing the input_shape dimensions to 2.

To fix this issue, the input_shape should be updated properly based on the state_size of the cells.

Here's the corrected `build` method for the `StackedRNNCells` class:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        # Update the input_shape properly based on the output_dim
        # Assuming input_shape is in the format (batch_size, timesteps, input_dim)
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

In this corrected method, the input_shape is updated based on the output_dim derived from the state_size of each cell. This ensures that the input_shape is updated correctly for subsequent cell builds.
