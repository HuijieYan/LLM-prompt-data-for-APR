The error seems to be occurring while trying to use the `recurrent.RNN` layer on the input data `x` in the test case. The function that is currently throwing the error is the `build` method in the `MinimalRNNCell` class. 

The issue is likely caused because the `assert len(input_shape) == 2` statement in the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class is expecting the `input_shape` to have a length of 2, but the actual input shape has a length of 3. This is leading to the assertion error.

To fix the bug, the check for the length of `input_shape` should be made less restrictive, or the input data dimensions should be modified to match the expected input shape in the test case and function.

Here's the corrected build method for the MinimalRNNCell class:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    if len(input_shape) != 3:
        raise ValueError("Input shape should have a length of 3")

    self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                  initializer='uniform',
                                  name='kernel')
    self.recurrent_kernel = self.add_weight(
        shape=(self.units, self.units),
        initializer='uniform',
        name='recurrent_kernel')
    self.built = True
```

This corrected method includes a check for the length of the input shape, and it raises a `ValueError` if the input shape does not have a length of 3.
