This bug is likely caused by how the input shapes are being manipulated within the `build` method of the `StackedRNNCells` class. It seems that the current implementation of the `build` method does not handle the input shapes and the cells properly, leading to a dimension mismatch.

To fix this bug, you may need to iterate through the cells and update the input shape dimensions based on the state size of each cell. Additionally, you should consider using the `get_initial_state` method to properly initialize the states of the cells.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` method:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    output_dim = input_shape[-1]
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell, 'state_size'):
            if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
                output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
            else:
                output_dim = cell.state_size
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)

    self.states = cell.get_initial_state(input_shape)
    self.built = True
```

By implementing these changes, the `build` method should handle the input shapes and the cells appropriately, resolving the dimension mismatch issue.
