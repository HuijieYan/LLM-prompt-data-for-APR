Potential error location: The bug may be in the line "if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):" as it tries to check if the state size of the cell has a length attribute.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the "cell.state_size" attribute is being checked for its length without verifying if it exists, which can lead to an AttributeError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Check if the "cell.state_size" attribute exists before checking its length.
- Handle the case where the "cell.state_size" does not have a length attribute.

Corrected code:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell, 'state_size'):
            if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
                output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
            else:
                output_dim = cell.state_size
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
