The error occurs in the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class. The bug is likely due to the cell not being properly set up with the input shape. The error message indicates that the input_shape has 3 dimensions instead of the expected 2.

To fix this bug, the `build` method should be modified to handle the input_shape properly and ensure that the dimensions are as expected.

Here's the corrected `build` method for the `MinimalRNNCell` class:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    # expecting input_shape to be of length 2
    if len(input_shape) != 2:
        raise ValueError('Input shape should be of length 2.')

    input_dim = input_shape[-1]
    self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(input_dim, self.units),
                                  initializer='uniform',
                                  name='kernel')
    self.recurrent_kernel = self.add_weight(
        shape=(self.units, self.units),
        initializer='uniform',
        name='recurrent_kernel')
    self.built = True
```

In this corrected version, we first ensure that the length of the input shape is 2, as expected. Then we extract the input dimension from the input shape to correctly initialize the kernel weights.

This change should fix the bug and ensure that the `build` method sets up the cell properly.
