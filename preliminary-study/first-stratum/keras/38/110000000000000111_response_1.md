Potential error location: The error may be occurring in the line `if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__')`, as it is trying to access the `state_size` attribute of the `cell` object.

Reason behind the bug: The bug may be occurring because `cell.state_size` is not a valid attribute for the `cell` object, or it may not have been initialized properly.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: We can first check if the `state_size` attribute exists for the `cell` object before trying to access it.

Corrected code:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell, 'state_size') and hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
