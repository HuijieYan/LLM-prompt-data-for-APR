The error occurs when the function `build` is called with an `input_shape` of `(None, 5, 8)` which violates the assertion `assert len(input_shape) == 2`. 

This happens because the input shape has three elements instead of two, causing the assertion to fail.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to handle the input shape properly. The input shape should be properly checked before the assertion and the necessary operations should be performed to handle the input shape with any number of elements.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` function:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        # Adjust input_shape according to the output_dim
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

In this corrected code, the input shape is properly adjusted according to the `output_dim`, and the assertion is removed. This allows the function to handle input shapes with any number of elements.
