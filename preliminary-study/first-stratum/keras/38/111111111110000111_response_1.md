The error occurs when trying to run the test case `test_minimal_rnn_cell_layer()`. The error message indicates that the length of the input shape is being checked within the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class, and it fails the assertion because the input shape is expected to have a length of 2, but it has a length of 3.

The potential error location is the `build` method within the `MinimalRNNCell` class. The error occurs in this line:

```python
assert len(input_shape) == 2
```

This happens because the input shape is expected to have a length of 2 (representing `(batch_size, input_dim)`), but in the given test case, the input shape has a length of 3, indicating a time dimension `(timesteps, input_dim)`. 

To fix this issue, we need to account for the time dimension when building the model.

The corrected code for the `build` method in the `MinimalRNNCell` class:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    # Expect input_shape to be (batch_size, timesteps, input_dim)
    assert len(input_shape) == 3
    self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                  initializer='uniform',
                                  name='kernel')
    self.recurrent_kernel = self.add_weight(
        shape=(self.units, self.units),
        initializer='uniform',
        name='recurrent_kernel')
    self.built = True
```

This correction acknowledges the presence of the time dimension in the input shape and accepts input shapes with a length of 3, corresponding to `(batch_size, timesteps, input_dim)`.
