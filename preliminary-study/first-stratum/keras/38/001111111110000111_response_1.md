The test case is testing the functionality of a MinimalRNNCell model, including its serialization and stacking. The error message occurs when trying to run the test case for stacking, more specifically on the line `y = layer(x)`. The error message indicates that the input shape being passed to the RNN cells has a time axis, causing the assertion error within the build function of the MinimalRNNCell class.

The bug is likely occurring within the build function of the `MinimalRNNCell` class. The assertion `assert len(input_shape) == 2` is expecting the input shape to have two dimensions, which is not the case when the model is being used in a stacked RNN scenario.

The bug can be fixed by modifying the build function to handle input shapes with more than two dimensions. Additionally, the `state_size` function could also be adjusted to handle multiple state sizes if the model is used in a stacked RNN scenario. 

Here's the corrected code for the `MinimalRNNCell` class:

```python
class MinimalRNNCell(keras.layers.Layer):

    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        self.units = units
        self.state_size = units
        super(MinimalRNNCell, self).__init__(**kwargs)

    def build(self, input_shape):
        # Ensure that the input shape has the correct dimension for the RNN cell
        assert len(input_shape) >= 2
        
        self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                      initializer='uniform',
                                      name='kernel')
        self.recurrent_kernel = self.add_weight(
            shape=(self.units, self.units),
            initializer='uniform',
            name='recurrent_kernel')
        self.built = True

    def call(self, inputs, states):
        prev_output = states[0]
        h = keras.backend.dot(inputs, self.kernel)
        output = h + keras.backend.dot(prev_output, self.recurrent_kernel)
        return output, [output]

    def get_config(self):
        config = {'units': self.units}
        base_config = super(MinimalRNNCell, self).get_config()
        return dict(list(base_config.items()) + list(config.items()))

    def state_size(self):
        # Return the state size corresponding to the RNN cell
        return self.units
```

In this corrected code, the build function now checks for input shape dimensions greater than or equal to 2, which allows the RNN cell to handle stacked RNN scenarios. Also, the `state_size` function is included to return the state size stored within the RNN cell.
