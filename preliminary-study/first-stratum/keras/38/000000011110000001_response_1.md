The error occurs when the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class is executed. The error message indicates that the input shape provided to the `build` function has a length of 3, while the function expects it to have a length of 2.

This error occurs because the input_shape provided to the `build` method has a time axis (None), which is causing the length of the input_shape to be 3 instead of 2 as expected by the `assert` statement in the `build` method.

To fix this issue, the length check in the `build` method should be adjusted to accommodate the time axis.

Here's the corrected code for the `MinimalRNNCell` class:

```python
class MinimalRNNCell(keras.layers.Layer):

    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        self.units = units
        self.state_size = units
        super(MinimalRNNCell, self).__init__(**kwargs)

    def build(self, input_shape):
        if len(input_shape) == 3:
            input_shape = input_shape[1:]  # Remove the time axis
        assert len(input_shape) == 2

        self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                      initializer='uniform',
                                      name='kernel')
        self.recurrent_kernel = self.add_weight(
            shape=(self.units, self.units),
            initializer='uniform',
            name='recurrent_kernel')
        self.built = True

    def call(self, inputs, states):
        prev_output = states[0]
        h = keras.backend.dot(inputs, self.kernel)
        output = h + keras.backend.dot(prev_output, self.recurrent_kernel)
        return output, [output]

    def get_config(self):
        config = {'units': self.units}
        base_config = super(MinimalRNNCell, self).get_config()
        return dict(list(base_config.items()) + list(config.items()))
```

In the corrected code, an additional check is made for the length of the input_shape. If the length of the input_shape is 3, it is modified to remove the time axis before performing the length check. This modification allows the build method to work correctly with input shapes that include a time axis.
