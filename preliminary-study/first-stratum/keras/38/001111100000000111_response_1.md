The potential error within the problematic function is in the loop that iterates through the cells. It attempts to access the state_size attribute of the cell and modify the input_shape based on its value. However, the error occurs because the state_size attribute is treated as a method and it's not being called correctly.

To fix the bug, the code should check if the state_size attribute is callable and then call it to get the state size, rather than treating it as an attribute that can be indexed directly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if callable(getattr(cell, 'state_size', None)):
            state_size = cell.state_size()
            output_dim = state_size[0] if isinstance(state_size, (list, tuple)) else state_size
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
