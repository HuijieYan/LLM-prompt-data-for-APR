Potential error location: The build function iterates over the cells list and updates the input_shape based on the state_size of each cell. However, the state_size is not always defined for each cell, and this can lead to errors.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The error occurs because the code does not handle the case where cell.state_size is not defined properly. This leads to the output_dim not being properly assigned, which can cause issues when updating the input_shape.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the cell.state_size is defined before trying to access it.
2. If cell.state_size is not defined, handle this case separately by considering a default value for output_dim.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell, 'state_size') and cell.state_size is not None:
            if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
                output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
            else:
                output_dim = cell.state_size
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
