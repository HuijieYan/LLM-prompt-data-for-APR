The error seems to be occurring in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function. The bug is due to the assumption that the shape of `y_true` is always `(num_samples, 1)`. The error message also suggests that there is an issue with the shape of the input tensors.

The bug occurs because the implementation of `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` assumes that the shape of `y_true` is always `(num_samples, 1)`, and the function does not handle the case when the shape of `y_true` is `(num_samples,)`. This results in the incorrect output.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to check the shape of `y_true` and squeeze it if applicable to handle both cases.

Here's the corrected `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    if K.int_shape(y_true)[-1] == 1:
        y_true = K.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)  # Squeeze y_true if its shape is (num_samples, 1)
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```

This modification checks the shape of `y_true` and squeezes it if its shape is `(num_samples, 1)`. Then it proceeds to calculate the top-k categorical accuracy as before. This approach ensures that the function works correctly for both cases of `y_true` shape.
