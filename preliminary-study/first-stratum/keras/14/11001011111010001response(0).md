The error message indicates that the shape of the input to the `in_top_k` function is causing the issue. The `in_top_k` function expects the input shapes to be rank 1, but the input shapes provided are [2,3], [], [], which are causing the error.

In the provided `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function, the bug is likely caused by the incorrect usage of the `in_top_k` function. The `in_top_k` function is being called with the wrong arguments, leading to the shape mismatch error.

The correct approach to fixing this bug would be to ensure that the input to the `in_top_k` function has the correct shapes. In this case, the `in_top_k` function expects the first argument to be the predictions (y_pred) and the second argument to be the true labels (y_true).

Here's the corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true = K.cast(y_true, 'int32')  # Cast true labels to 'int32' dtype
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, y_true, k), axis=-1)
```

In the corrected code, we cast the true labels (y_true) to 'int32' dtype before passing them to the `in_top_k` function. This ensures that the input shapes match the expectations of the `in_top_k` function, resolving the shape mismatch error.
