The bug in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function is likely due to the incorrect handling of the shape of `y_true` input. The error message indicates that the shape of `y_true` is causing issues when calculating the accuracy.

To fix this bug:
1. Check the shape of the `y_true` input and squeeze it if applicable to ensure that it has the correct shape for accurate calculations.
2. Ensure that the `y_true` input is in the correct format for comparison with predictions.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true = tf.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)  # Ensure the correct shape of y_true
    return tf.reduce_mean(tf.cast(tf.nn.in_top_k(y_pred, y_true, k), tf.float32))
```

With these corrections, the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function should now handle the input shapes correctly and produce accurate results.
