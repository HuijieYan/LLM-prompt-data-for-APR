The potential error in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function lies in the use of `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)`. 

The bug occurred because the code assumes that the shape of `y_true` is `(num_samples, 1)`, but it can also have a shape of `(num_samples,)`, which leads to incorrect output. Additionally, the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function has the same issue.

One approach for fixing the bug is to check the shape of `y_true` and squeeze it if applicable. This will ensure that the function works correctly for both shapes of `y_true`.

```python
# Corrected function
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true = K.squeeze(y_true, -1) # Squeeze if applicable
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```
