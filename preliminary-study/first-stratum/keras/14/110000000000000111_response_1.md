The bug in the provided function `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` is that it incorrectly uses `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` to find the max value of `y_true` and then tries to cast it to an integer using `K.cast`. This is not the correct approach to compare the predictions and the true labels.

The correct approach would be to directly use `y_true` for comparison with `y_pred`. 

Here's the corrected function for `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy`:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```
This corrected function compares `y_pred` with `y_true` directly, without taking the max value of `y_true`. This should fix the issue and produce the correct accuracy values.

The bug is occurring due to the incorrect comparison of the predictions and the true labels. The function is currently trying to cast the max value of `y_true` to an integer and then use that for comparison, which is not the correct approach.

The correct approach is to directly use `y_true` for comparison with `y_pred`.

The corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function has been provided above. This should resolve the bug and produce the correct accuracy values.
