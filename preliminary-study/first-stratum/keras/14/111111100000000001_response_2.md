Potential error location: The potential error lies in the use of the K.max() function within the K.cast() function. 

Reason for the bug: The K.max() function is being used directly within the K.cast() function, which is not compatible and causing the error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: The correct approach would be to first calculate the maximum value of y_true along the specified axis and then cast the result to 'int32'. This can be achieved by using the K.max() and K.cast() functions separately.

Corrected code:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    max_y_true = K.max(y_true, axis=-1)
    max_y_true_int = K.cast(max_y_true, 'int32')
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, max_y_true_int, k), axis=-1)
```
