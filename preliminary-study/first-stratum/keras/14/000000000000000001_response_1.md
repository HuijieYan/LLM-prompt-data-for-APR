The potential error in the provided function is that the K.max() function is being used on y_true without properly specifying the axis. This can lead to unexpected results or errors.

The reason behind the bug is that the K.max() function needs to be used with a proper axis specification in order to find the maximum value along the correct axis. Without specifying the axis, it may not give the desired result.

To fix the bug, we should specify the axis for the K.max() function to ensure it is finding the maximum value along the correct axis.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(K.max(y_true, axis=1), 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```
