The error message is indicating that there is a shape mismatch when using the `in_top_k` function. The error message specifically mentions that the shape must be rank 1 but is rank 0, and it provides the input shapes as `[2,3]`, `[]`, `[]`. This suggests that the `in_top_k` function is expecting the inputs to have rank 1, but at least one of the inputs provided has a rank of 0.

The bug is likely located in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function, where the `in_top_k` function is being called. The `max` function seems to be causing the shape mismatch.

The bug occurred because the `max` function is being used to calculate the maximum value along a certain axis, but the resulting shape is not compatible with the expected input shape of the `in_top_k` function.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to ensure that the shape of the input to the `in_top_k` function is compatible. This may involve manipulating the shape of the inputs using functions such as `K.max` and `K.cast` in a way that produces a rank 1 tensor.

Here's the corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32'), k),
                  axis=-1)
```
