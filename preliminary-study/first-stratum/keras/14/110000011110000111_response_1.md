The error occurs due to the wrong shape assumption made in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function. The function assumes that the shape of `y_true` is (num_samples, 1) and always reduces in the last dimension, which leads to incorrect output.

To fix the bug:
- Check the shape of `y_true` and squeeze if applicable to handle both (num_samples, 1) and (num_samples,) shapes. This will ensure that the function works correctly for both types of input shapes.

Here is the corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import keras.backend as K

def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    if K.int_shape(y_true)[-1] == 1:
        y_true = tf.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)  # Squeeze if the last dimension is 1
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, y_true, k), axis=-1)
```

This corrected function checks the shape of `y_true` and squeezes it if the last dimension is 1, allowing it to work correctly for both (num_samples, 1) and (num_samples,) shapes of `y_true`.
