Potential error location: The potential error in the code is the use of the K.max(y_true, axis=-1) within the K.cast function. This could cause an error as K.max returns the maximum value in y_true along the specified axis, but it is not supposed to be used with K.cast.

Reason for the bug: The function sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy is not implemented correctly. It should compare the true values (y_true) with the predicted values (y_pred) and then compute the top k categorical accuracy.

Approaches for fixing the bug: The bug can be fixed by using the K.argmax function to get the index of the maximum value in y_true instead of using K.max. Then, we can use K.equal to compare this index with the predicted values to compute the top k categorical accuracy.

Corrected code:
```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), k))
```
