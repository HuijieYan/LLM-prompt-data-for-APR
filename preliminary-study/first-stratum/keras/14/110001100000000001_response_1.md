Potential error location: The potential error is in the K.max(y_true, axis=-1) section of the code. 

Reason for the bug: The K.max(y_true, axis=-1) is attempting to find the maximum value along the last axis of the y_true tensor, which might not be the correct approach for this function.

Approach for fixing the bug: We need to modify the K.max() operation to find the indices of the maximum values along the last axis of y_true, rather than the actual maximum values.

Corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/keras_14/keras/metrics.py
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```
