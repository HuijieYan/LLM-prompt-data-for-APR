The error message indicates that there is an issue with the shape of the input tensors being passed to the `in_top_k` function. It is indicating that the shapes of the inputs to `in_top_k` are not compatible, specifically mentioning that the shape must be rank 1 but is rank 0.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the way `K.cast(K.max(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32')` is being used as an input to the `in_top_k` function.

The bug occurred because the dimensions of the input tensors were not properly aligned. The `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` command was trying to find the maximum value along a specific axis, but the result was expected to be in a different format than the one being provided to `K.cast()`. This mismatch of dimensions caused the error.

To fix the bug, the output of `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` needs to be reshaped to ensure that the input to `K.cast()` is of the shape expected by the function. Specifically, the output of `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` should be reshaped to match the expected input shape for `K.cast()`.

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    reshaped_max = K.max(y_true, axis=-1)
    reshaped_max = K.expand_dims(reshaped_max, axis=-1)  # Ensure the shape is rank 1
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(reshaped_max, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```
