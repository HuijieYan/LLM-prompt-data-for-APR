The error message indicates that the function `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` is assuming the shape of `y_true` to be `(num_samples, 1)` and always reducing in the last dimension, which leads to an incorrect output.

The bug occurs because the function assumes the shape of `y_true` to be `(num_samples, 1)` and always reduces in the last dimension, which is not always the case.

To fix the bug, we should check the shape of `y_true` and squeeze it if applicable.

Here's the corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true = K.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)  # Squeeze y_true if the shape is (num_samples, 1)
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```
