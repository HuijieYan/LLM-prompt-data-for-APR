The error message indicates that there is an issue with the shapes of the tensors being manipulated in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function. It seems that the function is assuming the shape of `y_true` to always be (num_samples, 1) and therefore reducing the dimension inappropriately.

The bug occurs because the function does not check the shape of `y_true` and incorrectly assumes its shape. This leads to incorrect outputs and invalid operations when the actual shape of `y_true` is different.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to check the shape of `y_true` and then manipulate it as necessary. If the shape is (num_samples, 1), it should proceed with the current logic. If the shape is (num_samples,), it should be reshaped or modified accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true = K.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```

In this corrected function, we first squeeze the `y_true` tensor to remove the extra dimension if it exists, and then proceed with the rest of the logic. This way, the function is able to handle both shapes of `y_true` correctly.
