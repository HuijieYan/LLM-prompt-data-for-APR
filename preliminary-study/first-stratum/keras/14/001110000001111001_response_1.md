Potential error location: The error may be occurring in the K.max(y_true, axis=-1) part of the code, as it seems to incorrectly find the max value of y_true.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The K.max function is being used incorrectly to find the max value of y_true, which results in the error.

Approach for fixing the bug: Use the K.argmax function to find the indices of the max value in y_true instead of trying to find the actual max value.

Corrected code:
```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), k),
                  axis=-1)
```
