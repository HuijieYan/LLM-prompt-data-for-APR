The error is occurring in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function. The error message indicates that the shape of the input tensors is not compatible with the `in_top_k` function being used in the implementation of `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy`.

The bug is likely caused by the assumption that the shape of `y_true` is always (num_samples, 1), leading to incorrect output when the actual shape is (num_samples,). Additionally, the code does not check the shape of `y_true` and does not squeeze it if applicable.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function to handle both shapes of `y_true` and to squeeze it if necessary. We also need to ensure that the input tensors have the correct shapes for the `in_top_k` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    # Squeeze y_true if the shape is (num_samples, 1)
    y_true = K.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1) if K.int_shape(y_true)[-1] == 1 else y_true
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```

This fix addresses the bug by first checking the shape of `y_true` and squeezing it if necessary. Additionally, it ensures that the input tensors have the correct shapes for the `in_top_k` function.
