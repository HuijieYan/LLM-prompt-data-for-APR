The issue with the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function is that it incorrectly uses `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` which results in incorrect accuracy calculations.

The bug occurs because the function is comparing the maximum value of `y_true` along the last dimension, which does not accurately represent the true labels for comparison.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to directly compare `y_true` with `y_pred` without using the `K.max` method.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```
