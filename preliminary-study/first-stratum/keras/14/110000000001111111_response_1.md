The potential error in the provided function is that it uses `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` which assumes that y_true has a 2D shape with the maximum value along the last dimension, whereas y_true may have a 1D shape. This would lead to incorrect behavior if y_true has a 1D shape.

The bug occurs because the function assumes the shape of y_true and always reduces in the last dimension, which leads to incorrect output. The max function is not appropriate for this implementation.

To fix the bug, the function should check the shape of y_true and squeeze if applicable. Also, the function should compare y_true directly with y_pred.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true = tf.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, y_true, k), axis=-1)
```
