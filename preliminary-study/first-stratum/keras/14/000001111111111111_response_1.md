The error occurs in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function where it applies `K.max` to `y_true` without considering its shape. This results in a shape mismatch when it is used inside `K.in_top_k`. The bug originates from the assumption that the shape of `y_true` is always (num_samples, 1), leading to incorrect behavior when the actual shape is (num_samples,).

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function to check the shape of `y_true` and squeeze it if necessary. This will ensure that the function handles both shapes of `y_true` correctly.

Below is the corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true = K.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)  # Squeeze y_true if its shape is (num_samples, 1)
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```

In this corrected version, the `K.squeeze` function is used to remove dimensions of size 1 from the shape of `y_true` before using it in the `K.in_top_k` function. This ensures that the shape of `y_true` is handled appropriately, regardless of whether it is (num_samples, 1) or (num_samples,).

By making this change, the function will be able to handle both shapes of `y_true` correctly and address the bug reported in the associated issue.
