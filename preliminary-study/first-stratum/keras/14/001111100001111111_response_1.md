The potential error location within the problematic function is the usage of `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)`. This seems incorrect as it is trying to find the maximum value of `y_true` along `axis=-1` and then casting it to 'int32'.

The bug probably occurred due to incorrect usage of the `K.max` function. It should be directly comparing `y_true` instead of finding its maximum value.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function to compare the true values directly instead of finding the maximum value.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/keras_14/keras/metrics.py

# corrected function
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(K.flatten(y_true), 'int32'), k))
```
This corrected function directly uses `y_true` for comparison with the predicted values.
