The error seems to be occurring in the line:
```python
return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(K.max(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```
Here, `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` is taking the maximum value along the last dimension, but this may not be the correct operation for the `y_true` input, especially when its shape is (num_samples, 1). The error message suggests that there is an issue with the shape and operation being performed.

The bug seems to be caused by assuming that `y_true` always has the shape (num_samples, 1) and reducing the last dimension, which is not always the case. This leads to incorrect output.

To fix this bug, we should check the shape of `y_true` and then squeeze if applicable.

Here's the corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    if K.int_shape(y_true)[-1] == 1:  # Check if the shape is (num_samples, 1)
        y_true = K.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)  # Squeeze the last dimension
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```

With this correction, the function first checks the shape of `y_true`. If it has the shape (num_samples, 1), it squeezes the last dimension before performing the in_top_k operation. This ensures that the function handles different shapes of `y_true` correctly and should resolve the issue.

The associated bug titles and descriptions suggest a problem with categorical accuracy when using different input types, such as tf.data datasets or numpy arrays. This may be related to the issues with `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function as it involves calculating accuracy. Therefore, fixing `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` could address issues related to categorical accuracy in different input scenarios.
