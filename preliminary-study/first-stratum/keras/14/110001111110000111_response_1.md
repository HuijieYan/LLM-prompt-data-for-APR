Upon analyzing the function and the error message, it appears that the issue lies in the implementation of the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function in the `keras/metrics.py` file. The error message indicates that the shape of the input tensors is causing the problem when using the `in_top_k` function.

The `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function is assuming that the shape of `y_true` is always `(num_samples, 1)`, which is causing the incorrect output. Instead, it should check the shape of `y_true` and squeeze it if applicable. Additionally, the function is using `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` which causes the error, as it reduces the dimensionality of the tensor.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated to handle both shapes of `y_true` correctly, and the usage of `K.max` should be reconsidered.

The corrected `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function is provided below:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true = K.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)  # Squeeze y_true if the shape is (num_samples, 1)
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```

This corrected implementation will handle both shapes of `y_true` correctly and remove the unnecessary reduction of dimensionality caused by `K.max`.
