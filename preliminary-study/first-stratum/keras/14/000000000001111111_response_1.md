Potential error location: The maximum value of y_true is being taken, but it should be directly compared with y_true.

Reason behind the bug: The function is incorrectly taking the maximum value of y_true and comparing it with y_pred using in_top_k, which is causing the incorrect output.

Approach for fixing the bug: Instead of taking the maximum value of y_true, the function should directly compare y_true with y_pred.

Corrected code:
```python
import tensorflow.keras.backend as K

def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(K.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32'), k))
```
