The error message indicates that the issue is related to the shape of the input tensors in the `in_top_k` function. The error specifically mentions that the shape must be rank 1 but is rank 0 for the operation 'InTopKV2'. It also provides the input shapes: [2,3], [], []. This suggests that the shape of the input tensors is causing the problem.

Upon inspecting the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function, it is evident that the bug is caused by the wrong use of the `K.max` function. Specifically, the `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` expression is trying to compute the maximum value along the last axis of `y_true` which results in losing the dimensionality information. This causes the mismatch in shapes and ultimately leads to the error.

To fix the bug, the `K.max` function should be used with `keepdims=True` to ensure that the dimensionality is preserved. Additionally, the `dtype` should be specified as 'int32' when casting the result of `K.max` to ensure compatibility with the `K.in_top_k` function.

Here is the corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf  # Assuming K is an alias for tensorflow.keras.backend and has been imported

def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(K.max(y_true, axis=-1, keepdims=True), 'int32'), k),
                  axis=-1)
```

With the corrections, the `K.max` function now preserves the dimensionality by using `keepdims=True`, and the casting to 'int32' ensures compatibility with the `K.in_top_k` function.
