The error occurs in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function, specifically in the line:
```python
return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(K.max(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32'), k),axis=-1)
```

The bug occurs because the code assumes that the shape of y_true is (num_samples, 1), and always reduces the last dimension. However, the shape of y_true can be (num_samples, 1) or (num_samples), which leads to incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we need to check the shape of y_true and squeeze if applicable.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true = K.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)  # Squeeze if the shape is (num_samples, 1)
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```
