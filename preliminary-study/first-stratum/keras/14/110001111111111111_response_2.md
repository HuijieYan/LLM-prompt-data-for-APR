The bug in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function is caused by assuming the shape of `y_true` to be `(num_samples, 1)`, which is not always the case. This leads to an incorrect output. Additionally, the function `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` has the same issue.

To fix the bug, we need to update the implementation of the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function to account for different shapes of `y_true`. This can be done by checking the shape of `y_true` and squeezing it if applicable.

Here's the corrected implementation of the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true_shape = K.int_shape(y_true)
    if y_true_shape[-1] == 1:  # Check if the shape is (num_samples, 1)
        y_true = K.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)  # Squeeze the last dimension
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```

By checking the shape of `y_true` and squeezing it if necessary, we ensure that the function handles different shapes correctly and produces the expected output.
