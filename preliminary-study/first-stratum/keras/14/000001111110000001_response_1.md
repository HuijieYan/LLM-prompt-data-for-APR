The error occurs in the function `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy`. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the shape of the input to the `in_top_k` function.

The bug in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function is that it is using the `in_top_k` function incorrectly. The `in_top_k` function requires the `targets` parameter to be a 1D tensor, but in the current implementation, it is being passed a 2D tensor. This causes the error related to the shape mismatch.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `y_true` parameter, which corresponds to the `targets` in the `in_top_k` function, is a 1D tensor.

Here's the corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32'), k))
```

In the corrected code:
- We use `K.argmax` to get the indices of the maximum value along the last dimension of `y_true`, resulting in a 1D tensor representing the class indices.
- We pass this 1D tensor to the `in_top_k` function as the `targets` parameter.
- We then calculate the mean of the top-k categorical accuracy using `K.mean`.

This correction ensures that the `in_top_k` function receives the correct input shapes and resolves the issue.
