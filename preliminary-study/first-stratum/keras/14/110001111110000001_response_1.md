The error message indicates that there is an issue with the shapes of the input tensors to the `in_top_k` function. The test case is trying to use the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function to evaluate the accuracy, but it's encountering an error related to the shapes of the input tensors. It seems that the error is related to the dimensions of `y_true` and `y_pred` tensors.

Upon reviewing the code, it appears that the bug is in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function. The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of the `max` function on `y_true`, leading to shape mismatch when using it as an input to `in_top_k`.

To fix this bug, the correct approach is to first find the indices of the maximum values in `y_true`, and then use those indices to compute the top-k accuracy. This can be achieved using TensorFlow's functions.

Below is the corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true_indices = tf.argmax(y_true, axis=-1)
    return K.mean(tf.nn.in_top_k(y_pred, y_true_indices, k), axis=-1)
```

In this corrected code, `tf.argmax` is used to find the indices of the maximum values in `y_true`, and then these indices are used to calculate the top-k accuracy using `tf.nn.in_top_k`. This approach ensures that the shapes of the input tensors are used correctly and should resolve the issue encountered in the test case.
