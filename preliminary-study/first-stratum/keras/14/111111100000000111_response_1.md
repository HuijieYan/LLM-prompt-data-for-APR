The bug in the provided code seems to be caused by the use of `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` which incorrectly calculates the maximum value along the last axis of `y_true`. This is causing the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function to produce incorrect results. 

To fix this bug, the code should directly compare `y_pred` with `y_true` instead of taking the maximum value along the last axis of `y_true`. 

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32'), k),
                  axis=-1)
```

This corrected code will directly compare `y_pred` with `y_true` as expected, and should resolve the issue of incorrect results being produced by the original function.

In addition, the function `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` should also be updated with the same correction to ensure consistency.

The proposed changes have been submitted in the associated GitHub issues as the potential bug fix.
