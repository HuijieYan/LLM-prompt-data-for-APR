Potential error location: 
The potential error in the code is with the use of K.max(y_true, axis=-1), which is not the correct way to calculate the maximum value across the categories for one-hot encoded labels.

Reason for the bug:
The bug occurs because K.max(y_true, axis=-1) is trying to find the maximum value along axis -1, but it is not the correct way to find the maximum value across the categories.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to calculate the maximum value across the categories for the one-hot encoded labels using K.argmax instead of K.max.

Corrected code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/keras_14/keras/metrics.py

from keras import backend as K

def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32'), k),
                  axis=-1)
```
