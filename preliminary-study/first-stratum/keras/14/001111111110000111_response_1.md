The error occurs because the existing code assumes the shape of y_true is (num_samples, 1), and always reduces in the last dimension which leads to the incorrect output. It should actually check the shape of y_true and squeeze if applicable.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy function to handle the shape of y_true correctly.

The corrected function should look like this:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    if K.ndim(y_true) == K.ndim(y_pred):
        y_true = K.squeeze(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), -1)

    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, y_true, k))
```

In this corrected version, we check the dimensions of y_true and y_pred. If they have the same dimension, we squeeze the y_true tensor to handle the case where the shape of y_true is (num_samples, 1). Then, we use the in_top_k function to calculate the top_k categorical accuracy.

Once this corrected function is applied, the test case should pass without any errors.
