Potential error location: The potential error is within the K.in_top_k() function and the use of K.max(y_true, axis=-1).

Reason for the bug: The bug occurs because the function K.max(y_true, axis=-1) is being used incorrectly, which leads to the incorrect calculation of the top k categorical accuracy.

Approach for fixing the bug: We need to use the K.argmax() function to get the indices of the maximum values in y_true, and then compare those indices with the top k values in y_pred to calculate the top k categorical accuracy.

Corrected code:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), k))
```
