Potential Error Location: 

The potential error lies in the use of `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` inside the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:

The bug occurs because `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` is used to find the maximum value along the last axis of `y_true`, which is not the correct way to obtain the maximum value for categorical accuracy calculation.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

We need to find the indices of the top-k predictions and compare them with the true labels. The correct approach is to use `K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)` to obtain the indices of the maximum values in `y_pred`.

Corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/keras_14/keras/metrics.py

# corrected function
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), k), axis=-1)
```
