The error message indicates that there is an issue with the shapes of the input tensors in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function. The error message specifically mentions that the shape must be rank 1 but is rank 0, and it shows the input shapes as [2,3], [], [].

The potential error location within the function is the following line:
```python
return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(K.max(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```

The issue occurs because the function assumes the shape of `y_true` to be (num_samples, 1) and attempts to reduce it in the last dimension, which leads to incorrect output. The function should check the shape of `y_true` and squeeze it if applicable.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to first check the shape of `y_true` and then apply the necessary modifications to handle both shapes of `y_true` appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    if K.int_shape(y_true)[-1] == 1:  # Check if the shape of y_true is (num_samples, 1)
        y_true = K.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)  # Squeeze y_true to shape (num_samples,)
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```

In this corrected code, we first check the shape of `y_true`, and if its last dimension is 1, we squeeze it to handle both shapes of `y_true` appropriately.
