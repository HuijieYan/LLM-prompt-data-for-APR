Potential error location: The potential error lies in the K.max(y_true, axis=-1) function call, which is not the correct way to find the maximum value along the last axis of y_true.

Reasons behind the bug: The K.max(y_true, axis=-1) function call is incorrect as it does not find the maximum value along the last axis of y_true as intended. This leads to incorrect results when trying to calculate the top k categorical accuracy.

Approaches for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, we need to use K.argmax instead of K.max to find the indices of the maximum value along the last axis of y_true. This will ensure that we are comparing the correct indices when calculating the top k categorical accuracy.

Corrected code:
```python
from keras import backend as K

def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32'), k),
                  axis=-1)
```
