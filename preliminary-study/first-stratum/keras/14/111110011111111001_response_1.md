The error message suggests that there is an issue with the shapes of the input tensors to the function `in_top_k` within the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function. The error specifically states, "Shape must be rank 1 but is rank 0".

The bug is likely to occur due to the disagreement in the shapes of the input tensors passed to the `in_top_k` function. The `in_top_k` function requires the `predictions` and `targets` tensors to have specific shapes based on the documentation. It seems that the shapes of the `y_pred` and `y_true` tensors do not match the expected shape for the function to work correctly.

To fix this bug, the shapes of the `y_pred` and `y_true` tensors need to be adjusted to match the expected input shapes of the `in_top_k` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from keras import backend as K

def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true_indices = K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1)
    return K.mean(K.cast(tf.nn.in_top_k(y_pred, y_true_indices, k), K.floatx()))
```

In the corrected code:
- We extract the indices of the maximum value in `y_true` using `K.argmax` to get the index of the true class label.
- Then we use `tf.nn.in_top_k` to compute the top-k accuracy by comparing the predicted values `y_pred` with the true indices.
- Finally, we use `K.mean` to compute the mean of the top-k accuracy for all samples.
