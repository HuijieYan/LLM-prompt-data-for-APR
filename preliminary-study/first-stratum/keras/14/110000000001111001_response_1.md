Potential Error:
The potential error in the code is the use of the K.in_top_k function, which is not being used correctly. 

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the parameters of the K.in_top_k function are not being used properly. The function expects the predicted values and the true values to be passed as the first and second arguments respectively, but the order is inverted in the original code.

Approach to Fix the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to swap the positions of y_true and y_pred when calling the K.in_top_k function.

Corrected Code:

```python
# corrected function
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_true, K.cast(K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1), 'int32'), k),
                  axis=-1)
```
