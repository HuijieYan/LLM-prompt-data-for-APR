Issue:
The error message suggests that there is an issue with the shape of the input when using the function `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy`. The function is assuming the shape of `y_true` to be `(num_samples, 1)`, which is leading to incorrect output. Additionally, the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` also has the same issue.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` is not handling the different shapes of `y_true` properly. It assumes the shape to be `(num_samples, 1)` and does not handle the case when the shape is `(num_samples,)`.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the shape of `y_true` and handle both cases where the shape is `(num_samples, 1)` or `(num_samples,)`.
2. If the shape is `(num_samples, 1)`, squeeze the array to make it one-dimensional. This will ensure that the function works correctly for both cases.

Corrected Code:
```python
# Corrected sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy function
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true_shape = K.int_shape(y_true)
    if len(y_true_shape) > 1 and y_true_shape[1] > 1:
        y_true = K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1)
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, y_true, k))
```

By checking the shape of `y_true` and handling the cases where the shape is `(num_samples, 1)` or `(num_samples,)`, the corrected function will ensure that `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` produces the correct output.
