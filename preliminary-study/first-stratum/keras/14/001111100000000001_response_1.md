The potential error in the provided function is that the K.max function is being used with the axis parameter within the K.cast function, which is not valid syntax.

The error is occurring because the K.cast function is used incorrectly. The K.cast function is used to cast a tensor to a different data type, but it is being used to cast the result of the K.max function, which is not the correct usage.

To fix this bug, we need to first calculate the indices of the top k elements in y_pred using the K.nn.top_k function, and then compare these indices with the indices of the maximum values in y_true using the K.equal function. Finally, we can calculate the mean of the result.

Here is the corrected code for the sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true_indices = K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1)
    y_pred_top_k_indices = K.tf.nn.top_k(y_pred, k=k).indices
    result = K.equal(K.expand_dims(y_true_indices, axis=-1), y_pred_top_k_indices)
    result = K.cast(result, K.floatx())
    result = K.any(result, axis=-1)
    return K.mean(result)
```
