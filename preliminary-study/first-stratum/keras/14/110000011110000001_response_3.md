The error occurs in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function due to the misuse of the backend function `K.in_top_k`. The `K.in_top_k` function expects the `targets` parameter to be 1D tensor, but in the current implementation, it's receiving a 2D tensor. This causes the error because the shape of the `targets` doesn't match the expected shape.

To fix this issue, the `y_true` tensor needs to be flattened before being passed to the `K.in_top_k` function. This will ensure that the `targets` parameter is a 1D tensor as expected.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true_flat = tf.reshape(y_true, [-1])  # Flatten y_true tensor
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(K.max(y_true_flat, axis=-1), 'int32'), k),
                  axis=-1)
```

By flattening the `y_true` tensor, the issue with the mismatched shapes is resolved and the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function should now work as expected.
