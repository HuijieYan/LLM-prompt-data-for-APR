The potential error in the given function `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` is that it is using `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` to find the maximum value along the last axis of y_true, assuming the shape is (num_samples, 1). However, as mentioned in the associated issue description, the shape of y_true can be (num_samples, 1) or (num_samples), and this assumption might lead to incorrect output.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to dynamically determine the shape of y_true and adjust the computation accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    # Determine the rank of y_true
    rank = K.ndim(y_true)
    
    if rank > 1:
        # Squeeze y_true to ensure its shape is (num_samples,)
        y_true = K.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)
    
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k))
```

This corrected code first determines the rank of y_true using `K.ndim()`. If the rank is greater than 1, it squeezes y_true to ensure its shape is (num_samples,). Then it calculates the `K.in_top_k` metric using the modified y_true and returns the mean of the result.

This fix addresses the issue by handling the different shapes of y_true and appropriately adjusting the computation based on the determined shape.
