The issue with the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function is that it is incorrectly using `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` to find the maximum value in `y_true`. This approach is incorrect because `y_true` can have a shape of (num_samples, 1) or (num_samples,), and using `K.max` to find the maximum value in `y_true` will not give the expected results.

To fix the bug, we need to determine the shape of `y_true` and adjust the calculation accordingly. If the shape of `y_true` is (num_samples, 1), we should squeeze it to have a shape of (num_samples,). Then we can correctly compare it with `y_pred` to calculate the top-k categorical accuracy.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    if y_true.shape[-1] == 1:
        y_true = K.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```

In this corrected function, we first check the shape of `y_true` and squeeze it if necessary. Then we proceed with the calculation of the top-k categorical accuracy.

By making these adjustments, the function should now correctly calculate the top-k categorical accuracy for the given input parameters.
