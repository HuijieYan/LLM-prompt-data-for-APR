The error message indicates that the shape of the input to the 'in_top_k' operation is causing an issue. The error specifically mentions that the shape must be rank 1 but is currently rank 0. This means that the input shapes are not compatible with the operation, leading to the ValueError.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of K.max(y_true, axis=-1). This may be causing the shape mismatch when trying to perform the 'in_top_k' operation.

The bug occurred because the function 'sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy' is not handling the input shapes correctly. The operation 'K.max(y_true, axis=-1)' may be reducing the shape in an unexpected way, leading to the rank 0 shape.

To fix the bug, the 'sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy' function should first convert the 'y_true' input to a one-hot encoding, and then use the 'in_top_k' function. This will ensure that the input shapes are compatible with the 'in_top_k' operation.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true = K.one_hot(K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), K.int_shape(y_pred)[-1])
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, y_true, k), axis=-1)
```

In this corrected function, the 'y_true' input is first converted to one-hot encoding using 'K.one_hot', ensuring that the shapes are compatible with the 'in_top_k' function. This should resolve the ValueError and provide the expected results.
