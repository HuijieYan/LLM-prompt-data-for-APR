Potential Error:
The potential error in the function is the use of `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)`. This line is attempting to find the maximum value along the last axis of `y_true`, but it is being used in a way that doesn't make sense in the context of finding the top k values.

Reason for the Bug:
The function likely intends to find the top k values from `y_pred` and compare them with `y_true`, but the implementation is incorrect.

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to find the top k values from `y_pred` and then compare them with `y_true` to determine the accuracy.

Corrected Code:
```python
from keras import backend as K

def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), k))
```
