The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(K.max(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32'), k), axis=-1)`. This line is attempting to calculate the top-k categorical accuracy for sparse categorical data, but it is using `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` to find the maximum value in `y_true`, which is incorrect.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the line is incorrectly using `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` to find the maximum value in `y_true`, which is not necessary for calculating sparse top-k categorical accuracy.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to directly compare `y_true` with the top-k values in `y_pred` to calculate sparse top-k categorical accuracy.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
import tensorflow.keras.backend as K

def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(K.flatten(y_true), 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```
