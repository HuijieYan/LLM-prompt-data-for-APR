Potential Error location: 
The potential error is in the line where the K.max function is being used. It seems like the function should be K.argmax instead of K.max.

Reason for the bug:
The K.max function returns the maximum value along a given axis, but it does not return the index of the maximum value. In this case, we need the index of the maximum value, which is why using K.max is causing the bug.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
We need to use the K.argmax function to get the index of the maximum value along the specified axis in y_true.

Corrected code:
```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32'), k),
                  axis=-1)
```
