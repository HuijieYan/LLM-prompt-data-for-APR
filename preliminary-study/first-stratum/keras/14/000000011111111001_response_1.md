The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(K.max(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32'), k)`.

The error message indicates that there is an issue with the input shapes being used in the `in_top_k` operation. The error specifically states: "Shape must be rank 1 but is rank 0 for 'in_top_k/InTopKV2' (op: 'InTopKV2') with input shapes: [2,3], [], []".

This error occurs because the `in_top_k` function expects the input shapes to be [batch_size, num_classes] for both `y_pred` and `y_true`. However, in the provided function, `y_true` is being processed with `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)`, which would reduce the shape to [batch_size] instead of [batch_size, num_classes]. This results in a shape mismatch error.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the `K.max` operation from processing `y_true`. We need to ensure that both `y_pred` and `y_true` are in the shape [batch_size, num_classes] when passed to the `in_top_k` function.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```
