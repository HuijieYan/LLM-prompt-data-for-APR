Potential error location: 
The error is likely occurring in the line `K.cast(K.max(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32')`. It seems that `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` is trying to find the maximum value along the last axis of `y_true`, but it should be finding the maximum value along the second axis instead (axis=1). Also, the result of `K.max(y_true, axis=1)` should be cast to 'int32' for comparing with the indices in `y_pred`.

Reasons behind the bug:
The bug is likely occurring because the function is incorrectly manipulating the `y_true` tensor to find the maximum value along the wrong axis and not casting the result to 'int32' for comparison with the indices in `y_pred`.

Approach for fixing the bug:
1. Find the maximum value along the second axis of `y_true` and cast the result to 'int32' for comparison with the indices in `y_pred'.
2. Use `K.max(y_true, axis=1)` and `K.cast(..., 'int32')` to achieve this.

Corrected code:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(K.argmax(y_true, axis=1), 'int32'), k),
                  axis=-1)
```
