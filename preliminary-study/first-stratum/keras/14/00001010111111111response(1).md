The bug is likely located in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function, specifically in the calculation where the maximum of `y_true` is used with the `K.cast` function. The error message indicates an issue with the shape of the input tensors, which suggests that the function is not handling the input shapes correctly.

The bug appears to occur because the function assumes the shape of `y_true` to be `(num_samples, 1)` and always reduces in the last dimension, which leads to an incorrect output when the shape is different.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated to check the shape of `y_true` and squeeze it if the shape is `(num_samples, 1)`. This will ensure that the function handles both shapes correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    if K.int_shape(y_true)[-1] == 1:
        y_true = K.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```

In this corrected code, we first check if the last dimension of `y_true` is 1, and if so, we squeeze the tensor to remove that dimension. Then we proceed with the calculations as before. This should properly handle both shapes of `y_true` and fix the bug.
