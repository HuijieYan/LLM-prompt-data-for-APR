The error message indicates that there is an issue with the shape of the inputs to the `in_top_k` function. It specifically mentions that the shape must be rank 1 but it is rank 0.

The bug is located in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function, specifically in the line:
```python
return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(K.max(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```

The bug occurs because the shape of `y_true` is not being handled properly, resulting in the incorrect shape being passed to the `in_top_k` function. This leads to a shape mismatch error.

To fix this bug, the shape of `y_true` needs to be correctly handled before passing it to the `in_top_k` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true = K.cast(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32')
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, y_true, k), axis=-1)
```

In this corrected code, the `K.argmax` function is used to properly handle the shape of `y_true` before passing it to the `in_top_k` function. This ensures that the input shapes are correct and resolves the bug.
