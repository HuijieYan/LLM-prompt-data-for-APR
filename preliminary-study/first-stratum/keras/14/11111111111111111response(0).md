The error occurs in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function where the utilization of `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` is causing the issue. This code assumes that the shape of `y_true` is (num_samples, 1), but it should also handle the case when the shape of `y_true` is (num_samples,).

The bug is happening because in the function `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy`, the code assumes that the shape of `y_true` is always (num_samples, 1). However, in some cases, the shape of `y_true` can be (num_samples,). The use of `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` is causing a shape mismatch, leading to the error.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle cases where the shape of `y_true` is (num_samples,). We can add a check to see if the shape of `y_true` is (num_samples,) and then convert it to (num_samples, 1) using `K.expand_dims`. This will ensure that the function works for both cases.

Here's the corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    if y_true.shape.ndims == y_pred.shape.ndims:
        y_true = K.expand_dims(y_true, axis=-1)
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(K.max(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```
