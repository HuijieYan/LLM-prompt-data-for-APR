Potential error location: The potential error is in the usage of `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)`. This may not be achieving the intended result of finding the maximum value in the y_true tensor.

Reasons behind the bug:
1. The `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` is used to find the maximum value along the last axis of the y_true tensor. However, the intended behavior is to find the index of the maximum value, not the maximum value itself.
2. The use of `K.cast(K.max(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32')` may result in incorrect casting of the maximum value to 'int32' data type.

Approach for fixing the bug:
1. Use `K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1)` instead of `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` to find the index of the maximum value along the last axis of the y_true tensor.
2. Use `K.cast` to cast the result of `K.argmax` to the appropriate data type.

Corrected code:

```python
# corrected function
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32'), k),
                  axis=-1)
```
