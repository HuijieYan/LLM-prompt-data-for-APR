The error message indicates that the bug is likely in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function, specifically in the line `K.cast(K.max(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32')`. This is causing issues with the input shape of `y_true` and the operation `K.in_top_k`, as it expects a different shape.

The bug occurs because the existing code assumes the shape of `y_true` is `(num_samples, 1)`, and always reduces in the last dimension, which leads to incorrect output. The code should check the shape of `y_true` and squeeze if applicable. 

To fix the bug, it is necessary to update the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function to consider the shape of `y_true` and to adjust the operation accordingly. The fix should involve checking the shape of `y_true` and squeezing it if its shape is `(num_samples, 1)`.

Here's a corrected version of the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true = K.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)  # Squeeze y_true if its shape is (num_samples, 1)
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```

In this corrected version, `K.squeeze` is used to remove the last dimension from `y_true` if its shape is `(num_samples, 1)`. This ensures that the operation works correctly, regardless of the shape of `y_true`.

This fix addresses the issue described in the error message and the associated GitHub issue.
