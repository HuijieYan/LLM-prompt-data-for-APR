The error message indicates that the function `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` is using `K.in_top_k` with incorrect input shapes. The error message specifies that the shape must be rank 1, but it is rank 0 for the 'in_top_k/InTopKV2' operation. The input shapes are [2,3], [], [], but they should be compatible for the in_top_k operation. This is causing a ValueError.

The potential error location is within the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function where it uses the `K.in_top_k` method.

The bug occurs because the input shapes provided to `K.in_top_k` are not compatible with the requirements of the method. The shapes need to be adjusted to meet the rank 1 shape requirement.

To fix the bug, the shapes of `y_pred` and `y_true` need to be modified to ensure that they are compatible with the `K.in_top_k` method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), k), axis=-1)
```
