The potential error location within the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function is the incorrect usage of `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)`. This code is trying to find the maximum value along the last dimension of `y_true` which is incorrect for the function's purpose.

The bug occurred because the function is incorrectly comparing the predicted values with the maximum value of `y_true` instead of directly comparing with `y_true`.

To fix the bug, the function should directly compare the predicted values with `y_true`. Additionally, it should handle the case where `y_true` has a shape of (num_samples, 1) or (num_samples) and adjust accordingly.

The corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function is as follows:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true = tf.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1) # handle the case where y_true has shape (num_samples, 1)
    return tf.keras.metrics.top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k)
```
