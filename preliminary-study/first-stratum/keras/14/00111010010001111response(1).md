The error seems to be occurring in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function when trying to use `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` to find the maximum value in the `y_true` variable. However, based on the input type information provided, it appears that `y_true` is a two-dimensional tensor, which might indicate an invalid operation. 

This is happening because the function is assuming that the shape of y_true is (num_samples, 1), while it can also be (num_samples,). This is leading to an error in the calculation of the sparse top k categorical accuracy.

To fix this issue, the function needs to be updated to handle both cases - (num_samples, 1) and (num_samples,) for the shape of y_true. If the shape is (num_samples, 1), it does not need to be squeezed, but if the shape is (num_samples,), it needs to be squeezed to have a shape of (num_samples, 1).

Here's the corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    if K.int_shape(y_true)[-1] == 1:  # Checking if the shape is (num_samples, 1)
        y_true = K.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)  # Squeezing to have a shape of (num_samples,)
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```

In this corrected function, we first check if the shape of `y_true` is (num_samples, 1) using `K.int_shape(y_true)[-1]`. If it is, then no squeezing is necessary. If the shape is (num_samples,), then we squeeze it using `K.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)` to have a shape of (num_samples, 1). Then, the function continues as before to calculate the sparse top k categorical accuracy.

This approach handles both cases of the shape of `y_true` and should resolve the issue with the function.
