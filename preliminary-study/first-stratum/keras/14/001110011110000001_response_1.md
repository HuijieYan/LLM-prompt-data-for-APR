The error message indicates that there is a mismatch between the expected shape of the input and the actual shape. This suggests that the issue might be in the function `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` with the usage of the `K.max` function. 

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `K.max` function is being used with the `axis=-1`, which should result in the maximum value being computed along the last axis of the tensor. However, it seems that the shape of the tensor `y_true` is causing an issue when casting it to `int32`, and it results in the error when using it in the `K.in_top_k` function.

To fix this bug, we should modify the logic to compute the indices of the true maximum value along the last axis of `y_true`, and then use those indices as targets in `K.in_top_k`. This should solve the shape mismatch issue.

Here's the corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    # Compute the indices of the true maximum values along the last axis
    y_true_indices = K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1)
    # Use the indices as targets in K.in_top_k
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, y_true_indices, k), axis=-1)
```
