The potential error in the code is that it is using K.max(y_true, axis=-1) to find the maximum value along the last axis of y_true. This may not give the correct maximum value if y_true is a sparse representation.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code assumes the shape of y_true to always be (num_samples, 1), leading to an incorrect output when the shape is different.

To fix the bug, we should check the shape of y_true and squeeze it if applicable before finding the maximum value.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true = tf.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)
    return tf.keras.metrics.sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k)
```
