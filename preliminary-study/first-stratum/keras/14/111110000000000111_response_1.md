The potential error in the provided function `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` is in the line:

```python
K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(K.max(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32'), k),
                  axis=-1)
```

The error occurs because `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` assumes the shape of `y_true` to be (num_samples, 1), but it can also be (num_samples,), leading to an incorrect output. The code should check the shape of `y_true` and squeeze if applicable.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to accommodate both shapes of `y_true` and adjust the calculation accordingly.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    if y_true.shape[-1] == 1:
        y_true = K.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```

This fix checks for the shape of `y_true` and squeezes the array if the last dimension is 1. This will ensure that the function can handle both shapes of `y_true` and provide the correct output for sparse top k categorical accuracy.
