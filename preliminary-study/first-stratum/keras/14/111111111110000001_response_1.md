The error message indicates that there is a shape mismatch occurring within the `in_top_k` function of the `tensorflow_backend.py` file. The error suggests that the shape of the input tensors is not compatible with the operation being performed.

The potential error location within the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function is the line that invokes the `in_top_k` function:

```python
return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(K.max(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```

The reasons for the occurrence of the bug are:
1. The shape of the input tensors `y_pred` and `y_true` may not be compatible with the `in_top_k` function.
2. The use of `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` may not be yielding the expected result, leading to a shape mismatch.

To fix the bug, the code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function can be corrected as follows:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true = K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1)  # Convert one-hot y_true to class indices
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, y_true, k), axis=-1)
```

In the corrected code:
1. `K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1)` is used to convert one-hot encoded `y_true` to class indices, ensuring that the shapes are compatible for the `in_top_k` function.
2. The modified function then returns the mean of the results obtained from the `in_top_k` function.
