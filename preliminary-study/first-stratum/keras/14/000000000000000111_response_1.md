The bug in the provided function `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` seems to be caused by the incorrect usage of `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` and `K.cast` functions in the return statement.

The function `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` seems to be attempting to find the maximum value along the last axis, but it should actually be comparing the predicted values `y_pred` with the true values `y_true`. Additionally, the usage of `K.cast` seems unnecessary and may be contributing to the incorrect output.

To fix this bug, the function should compare the predicted values with the true values directly, rather than using `K.max` and `K.cast`.

Here's the corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    return tf.keras.metrics.sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k)
```

This corrected code uses the `tf.keras.metrics.sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function, which is specifically designed to calculate the top k categorical accuracy for sparse labels. This should resolve the bug and produce the expected behavior for the function.
