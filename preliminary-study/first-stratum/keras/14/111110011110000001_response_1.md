The error message indicates an issue with the input shape for the 'in_top_k/InTopKV2' operation, specifically mentioning that the shape must be rank 1 but is rank 0. This suggests that the input shapes provided to the operation are incorrect, resulting in the error.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the way the inputs are being used with the 'in_top_k' function. It could be that the shapes of 'y_true' and 'y_pred' are not aligning with the expected input shape for the 'in_top_k' function.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely related to the incorrect usage or interpretation of input shapes for the 'in_top_k' function.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that the input shapes provided to the 'in_top_k' function are correctly aligned with the expected input shapes. This may involve reshaping or transforming the input data to match the requirements of the 'in_top_k' function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import keras.backend as K

def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    return K.mean(K.cast(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), k), dtype='float32'))
```

In the corrected code, the input to the `in_top_k` function is reshaped using `K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1)` to ensure that the input shapes are compatible with the function's requirements. The result is also cast to 'float32' to ensure the output is of the correct data type.
