The error message suggests that the bug is related to the shape of the input being fed into the function `in_top_k` which is called in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function. The error is specifically related to the shape of the input tensors.

The bug occurs because the `y_true` tensor is being used in a way that doesn't align with the expected input shape for the `in_top_k` function. The `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` operation on `y_true` is attempting to calculate the maximum value along the last dimension, but the result is not compatible with the `in_top_k` function.

To resolve this issue, the `y_true` tensor should be reshaped or transformed to align with the expected input shape for the `in_top_k` function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true = K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1)  # Convert one-hot encoded y_true to class labels
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, y_true, k), axis=-1)
```

In the corrected code, we first use `K.argmax` to convert the one-hot encoded `y_true` into class labels, which will align with the expected input shape for the `in_top_k` function. Then, we calculate the top-k categorical accuracy as intended.
