The error message indicates that the `in_top_k` function is receiving incorrect input shapes. This suggests that the bug is likely located in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function, specifically in the way the inputs are processed before being passed to `in_top_k`.

The bug is occurring because the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function is not handling the input shapes properly. The function is using `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` without considering that `y_true` might have different shapes based on its input, leading to the issue with `in_top_k`.

To fix this bug, the function needs to handle the input shapes of `y_true` and `y_pred` properly before passing them to `in_top_k`. This can be achieved by reshaping the input tensors appropriately to ensure that they have compatible shapes.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    reshape_y_true = K.reshape(y_true, (-1,))
    reshape_y_pred = K.reshape(y_pred, (-1, K.int_shape(y_pred)[-1]))
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(reshape_y_pred, K.cast(K.max(reshape_y_true, axis=-1), 'int32'), k))
```
