The error occurs in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function. The error message indicates that the shape of the input is causing issues in the `in_top_k` function, which is a part of the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function.

The bug is caused by assuming the shape of y_true to be (num_samples, 1) and always reducing in the last dimension, which leads to incorrect output. The correct approach is to check the shape of y_true and squeeze if applicable.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true = tf.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)  # Squeeze if the shape is (num_samples, 1)
    return tf.reduce_mean(tf.cast(tf.nn.in_top_k(y_pred, y_true, k), tf.float32), axis=-1)
```

In this corrected function:
1. We use `tf.squeeze` to remove dimensions of size 1 from the shape of `y_true`.
2. We then calculate the top k categorical accuracy using `tf.nn.in_top_k`.
3. Finally, we take the mean using `tf.reduce_mean` to get the accuracy.

This correction should address the issues mentioned in the error message and fix the bug in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function.
