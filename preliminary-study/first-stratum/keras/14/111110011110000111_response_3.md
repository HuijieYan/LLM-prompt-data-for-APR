The bug in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function arises from the assumption about the shape of `y_true`. The existing code assumes that the shape of `y_true` is `(num_samples, 1)`, and always reduces in the last dimension, which leads to incorrect output. However, the shape of `y_true` can be `(num_samples, 1)` or `(num_samples)`.

To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Check the shape of `y_true` and squeeze if applicable to handle both `(num_samples, 1)` and `(num_samples)` cases.
2. Modify the code to handle both cases of `y_true` shapes.

Here's the corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
import keras.backend as K
import tensorflow as tf

def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true = K.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)  # Squeeze if y_true shape is (num_samples, 1)
    return K.mean(tf.math.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```

The issue has been resolved by adding a line to squeeze `y_true` if its shape is `(num_samples, 1)`, ensuring that the function handles both cases of `y_true` shapes. This should resolve the bug reported in the test case.
