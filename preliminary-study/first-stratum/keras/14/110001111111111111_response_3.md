The issue seems to be with the calculation inside the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function. The error message indicates that the shape of the `y_true` variable is causing the problem, specifically when it has a shape of (num_samples,) rather than (num_samples, 1).

The bug occurs because the current code fails to account for different shapes of `y_true`. The function assumes that the shape is always (num_samples, 1) and attempts to reduce the last dimension, causing the incorrect output.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function to check the shape of `y_true` and then squeeze it if applicable. This ensures that the shape is consistent and handled correctly in the rest of the function.

Based on this approach, the corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function would be:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    # Check shape of y_true and squeeze if applicable
    if len(K.int_shape(y_true)) > 1:
        y_true = K.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)
    
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```
