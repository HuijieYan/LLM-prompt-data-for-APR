The error is caused by the function `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` when it is used with `tf.data` inputs. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the shape of the input tensors.

The potential error location within the function is in the line:
```python
return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(K.max(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```
This line tries to calculate the sparse top k categorical accuracy, but it seems to be using K.max with the wrong arguments, causing issues with the shapes of the input tensors.

The bug occurs because the function assumes the shape of y_true to be (num_samples, 1) and always reduces in the last dimension, leading to incorrect output. However, the shape of y_true can also be (num_samples,).

To fix the bug, we need to check the shape of y_true and squeeze it if applicable.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    if y_true.shape[-1] == 1:
        y_true = tf.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```

This function checks the shape of y_true and squeezes it if the last dimension is 1. Then, it calculates the sparse top k categorical accuracy using the corrected input tensors.
