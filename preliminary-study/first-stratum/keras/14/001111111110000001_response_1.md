The error message is related to the shape of the inputs to the `in_top_k` function. The error message indicates that the shape of the inputs does not match the expected shape.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(K.max(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32'), k)`. This is where the input shapes are used, and the error message suggests that the shapes are not compatible with the operation.

The bug occurs because the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function is not handling the input shapes correctly. It seems to expect the shape of `y_true` to be (num_samples,) or (num_samples, 1), and the shape of `y_pred` to be (num_samples, num_classes). However, the current implementation does not account for these expected shapes, leading to the error.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the inputs to the `in_top_k` function have the correct shapes. This involves reshaping the inputs if necessary to match the expected shapes.

Here's the corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true = K.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)  # Ensure y_true has shape (num_samples,)
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```

In this corrected code, we use `K.squeeze` to ensure that the shape of `y_true` is (num_samples,) regardless of whether it was originally (num_samples,) or (num_samples, 1). This aligns with the expected shape for `y_true`.
