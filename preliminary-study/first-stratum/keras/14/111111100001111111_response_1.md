The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` as this is causing the issue with the sparse categorical accuracy calculation.

The bug occurs because `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` is squeezing the shape of `y_true` to (num_samples,), leading to incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we can modify the code to check the shape of `y_true` and squeeze if applicable.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true = K.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)  # Squeeze the shape of y_true if applicable
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```
