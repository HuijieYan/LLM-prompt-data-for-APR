The error occurs in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function, which is used to calculate the top k categorical accuracy.

The current implementation assumes the shape of `y_true` to be `(num_samples, 1)`, but it can also be `(num_samples,)`. This assumption is leading to the incorrect output.

The function uses `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` to calculate the maximum value, but this operation is causing the error because it is not handling the different shapes of `y_true`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to handle both cases of `y_true` shape. If the shape is `(num_samples, 1)`, we should squeeze the dimensions to make it `(num_samples,)`.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true = K.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)  # Squeeze the dimensions if the shape is (num_samples, 1)
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```

In the corrected function, we added `K.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)` to handle the case where the shape of `y_true` is `(num_samples, 1)`. This change ensures that the function can handle both shapes of `y_true` correctly.
