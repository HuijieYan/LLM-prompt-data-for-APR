Potential error location: 
The potential error is in the line `K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(K.max(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32'), k),axis=-1)`. This line is trying to calculate the top k categorical accuracy but is using the max value of y_true as the index for the in_top_k function, which is incorrect.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: 
The bug occurred because the function does not correctly calculate the top k categorical accuracy. It is using the maximum value in y_true as the index for the in_top_k function, which is not the correct approach.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: 
To fix the bug, we need to calculate the top k categorical accuracy using y_pred and y_true directly, without using the maximum value of y_true.

Corrected code:
```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), k), axis=-1)
```
