The error message indicates that the `in_top_k` function is expecting input shapes that are not being provided. This is likely due to incorrect processing of the input shapes or improper casting. 

The bug is occurring in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function where the Keras backend operations are not being handled properly. The `K.max` operation with the argument `axis=-1` to find the maximum value of `y_true` with respect to the last dimension is not being handled correctly, leading to the invalid input shapes error.

To fix the bug, the input shapes should be handled properly, and the `K.max` operation should be replaced with `K.argmax` to get the indices of the maximum values along the desired axis. Additionally, the proper casting and reshaping of the tensors should be done to ensure that the input shapes are compatible with the `in_top_k` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true_indices = K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1)  # Get the indices of the maximum values in y_true
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, y_true_indices, k))
```
