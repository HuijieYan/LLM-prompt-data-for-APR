The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of `K.max` on the `y_true` tensor, which might be causing the error because it assumes the shape of y_true is (num_samples, 1), always reducing in the last dimension which leads to incorrect output. 

The bug is occurring because the existing code incorrectly assumes the shape of y_true as (num_samples, 1), and always reduces in the last dimension. This results in an incorrect output. Additionally, the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function seems to have the same issue.

One approach to fix the bug is to check the shape of y_true and squeeze if applicable to ensure that it is consistent before using it in the calculations.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    axis = -1
    if K.int_shape(y_true)[-1] == 1:
      axis = -2
      y_true = K.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)
      
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(K.max(y_true, axis=axis), 'int32'), k),
                  axis=-1)
```
This updated code includes a check for the shape of `y_true` and a squeeze operation if the shape is (num_samples, 1), ensuring consistency and correct calculation of the top k categorical accuracy.
