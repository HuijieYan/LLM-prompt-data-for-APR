The bug occurs when the function `process_list_block` processes the `docstring`. It fails to correctly manipulate and modify the `docstring` as well as the `block` of text it is supposed to process.

The bug is likely caused by incorrect handling of indices and slicing operations while modifying the `docstring` and `block`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the indices and slicing operations are correctly used when manipulating the `docstring` and `block`. Additionally, we need to ensure that the replacements and regex patterns are correctly applied to the lines within the `block`.

Here is the corrected code for the `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else
                                      ending_point)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    lines = [line[leading_spaces:] for line in lines]
    lines = [re.sub(r'^-\s+(\S+):(.*)', r'- __\1__:\2', line) for line in lines]
    lines = [re.sub(r'^\s{4}', '', line) for line in lines]
    indent = 0
    text_block = False
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        if line.startswith('-'):
            if len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) > indent:
                text_block = False
                lines[i] = '\n' + line
            else:
                text_block = True
                indent = len(line) - len(line.lstrip())
                lines[i] = '\n' + line
        else:
            text_block = False
            indent = 0
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
```

This corrected code ensures that the indices and slicing operations are handled correctly, and the replacements and regex patterns are applied as intended.
