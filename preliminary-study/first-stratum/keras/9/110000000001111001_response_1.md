The bug occurs in the code where the `block` variable is defined. The ending index for slicing the `docstring` is calculated incorrectly, leading to an incorrect `block` string. Additionally, the `docstring_slice` is also not defined correctly.

The `ending_point` should be assigned the value of `len(docstring)` if there is no `\n\n` sequence found after the `starting_point`. The `block` should be assigned the portion of `docstring` from `starting_point` to `ending_point`. The `docstring_slice` should be assigned the `block` with the `marker` replaced.

The corrected code is as follows:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    
    if ending_point == -1:
        ending_point = len(docstring)
        
    block = docstring[starting_point:ending_point]
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point] + docstring_slice + docstring[section_end:])
    
    lines = block.split('\n')
    
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)', r'- __\1__:\2', line) for line in lines]
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ', '', line) for line in lines]
    
    indent = 0
    text_block = False
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        spaces = re.search(r'\S', line)
        if spaces:
            if line[spaces.start()] == '-':
                indent = spaces.start() + 1
                if text_block:
                    text_block = False
                    lines[i] = '\n' + line
            elif spaces.start() < indent:
                text_block = True
                indent = spaces.start()
                lines[i] = '\n' + line
        else:
            text_block = False
            indent = 0
            
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    
    return docstring, block
```
