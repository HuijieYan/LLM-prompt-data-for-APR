Potential error location: 

The potential error is in the section where the `docstring` is being modified. 

Reasons for the bug: 

The ending_point value is being subtracted by 1, which might lead to incorrect slicing of the `docstring` when creating `docstring_slice`. This could potentially cause an index out of range error.

Approaches for fixing the bug:

1. Check if `ending_point` is not equal to -1 before subtracting 1 from it.
2. Update the slicing of `docstring` to ensure that the correct block is replaced with the marker.

Corrected code:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    if ending_point != -1:
      block = docstring[starting_point:ending_point]
    else:
      block = docstring[starting_point:]
    
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    # Usually lines have at least 4 additional leading spaces.
    # These have to be removed, but first the list roots have to be detected.
    top_level_regex = r'^    ([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)'
    top_level_replacement = r'- __\1__:\2'
    lines = [re.sub(top_level_regex, top_level_replacement, line) for line in lines]
    # All the other lines get simply the 4 leading space (if present) removed
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ', '', line) for line in lines]
    # Fix text lines after lists
    indent = 0
    text_block = False
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        spaces = re.search(r'\S', line)
        if spaces:
            # If it is a list element
            if line[spaces.start()] == '-':
                indent = spaces.start() + 1
                if text_block:
                    text_block = False
                    lines[i] = '\n' + line
            elif spaces.start() < indent:
                text_block = True
                indent = spaces.start()
                lines[i] = '\n' + line
        else:
            text_block = False
            indent = 0
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
