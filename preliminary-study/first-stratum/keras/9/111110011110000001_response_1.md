The error message is showing an assertion error related to the comparison of two strings. The test is comparing the expected markdown output with the actual markdown output of the `docstring` obtained from the `process_docstring` function. The error suggests differences in the list formatting in the markdown output.

The potential error location in the `process_list_block` function is the handling of list formatting and the removal of leading spaces.

The bug is occurring because the function is not properly handling the conversion of list elements into markdown format. This results in discrepancies between the expected and actual markdown outputs.

To fix this bug, the function needs to properly convert the list elements into markdown format and ensure that the leading spaces are removed appropriately.

Here's the corrected `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else ending_point - 1)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    
    # Convert list elements into markdown format
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        if lines[i].startswith('- '):
            lines[i] = '- ' + lines[i][2:]
    
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
```
