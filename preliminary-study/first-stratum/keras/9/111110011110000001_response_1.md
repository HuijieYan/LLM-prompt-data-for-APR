The error seems to be related to the format of a list block in the docstring. The test case is expecting a list format in the docstring, but it's not being generated correctly.

The potential error location in the function is the code that manipulates the lines to create the list block. It seems that the function is not correctly identifying and processing list elements.

The bug seems to occur because the function is not properly detecting and converting list elements into the correct markdown format. This results in the assertion error in the test case.

To fix the bug, the function should properly identify list elements, remove leading spaces, and convert them into the correct markdown format. This might involve fixing the regular expressions used to detect list elements and adjusting the logic for processing them.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else ending_point - 1)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point] + docstring_slice + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    # Convert list elements to markdown format
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    (- .*):', r'<li><strong>\1</strong>:', line) for line in lines]
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    - ', r'<li>', line) for line in lines]
    lines = [re.sub(r'^(- |    )', r'', line) for line in lines]
    lines = ['<ul>' if i == 0 else line for i, line in enumerate(lines)]
    lines = ['</ul>' if i == len(lines) - 1 else line for i, line in enumerate(lines)]

    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
```

This corrected code includes adjustments to properly convert list elements into the correct markdown format, using regular expressions and logic for handling list markup. This should resolve the issue and pass the test case.
