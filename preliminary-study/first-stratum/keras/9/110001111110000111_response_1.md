Certainly! Here's the full code of the fixed `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

# Corrected process_list_block function
def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else ending_point - 1)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point] + docstring_slice + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]  # Remove leading spaces
    lines = [re.sub(r'^- ', '- ', line) for line in lines]  # Fix list formatting
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
```

This corrected code ensures that the list elements are properly formatted, addressing the issue with the incorrect representation of the markdown in the test case.
