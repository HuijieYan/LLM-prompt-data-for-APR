The bug seems to be in the `process_list_block` function, particularly in the processing of the `docstring` and the `block` variable. The function is not processing the `docstring` and `block` as expected based on the context from the provided input parameter values and the expected output.

The reason for the bug is likely due to incorrect manipulation of the `docstring` and `block` variables while reformatting the lines. Additionally, the logic related to indentation removal for the base list elements might not be functioning as expected.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to refine the logic for processing the `docstring` and the `block` variable. A potential solution could involve adjusting the manipulation steps for `docstring` and `block` to correctly apply the replacements and remove unnecessary spaces or newlines. Additionally, the logic related to handling list indentation needs to be reviewed and potentially updated.

Below is the corrected code for the `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(ending_point if ending_point != -1 else len(docstring))]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point] + docstring_slice + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')

    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]

    # Usually lines have at least 4 additional leading spaces. These have to be removed, but first the list roots have to be detected.
    top_level_regex = r'^    (\S+):(.*)'
    top_level_replacement = r'- __\1__:\2'
    lines = [re.sub(top_level_regex, top_level_replacement, line) for line in lines]

    # All the other lines get simply the 4 leading space (if present) removed
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ', '', line) for line in lines]

    # Fix text lines after lists
    processed_lines = []
    for line in lines:
        if line.startswith('- '):
            processed_lines.append(line)
        else:
            # Indent subsequent text after list
            processed_lines[-1] += '\n' + line if processed_lines else line

    block = '\n'.join(processed_lines)
    return docstring, block
``` 

This corrected code addresses the issues present in the previous implementation and is expected to produce the correct output for the given input parameter values and the expected case 1.
