The error in the provided function seems to be related to the processing of the docstring and the block within the function. The function is intended to process a docstring, extract a block of text, modify it, and then return the modified docstring along with the modified block.

The issue seems to stem from the computation of the ending_point, where the calculation might be incorrect for extracting the block of text. Also, there are some inconsistencies in how the block of text is being processed and modified, leading to incorrect output.

To fix the bug, the computation of ending_point needs to be revised to correctly extract the block of text. Additionally, the processing of the block to remove leading spaces and fix text lines after lists needs to be revised for accurate results.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point: (None if ending_point == -1 else ending_point)]
    
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = docstring[:starting_point] + docstring_slice + docstring[section_end:]
    
    lines = block.split('\n')
    lines = [re.sub(' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    
    top_level_regex = r'^([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)'
    top_level_replacement = r'- __\1__:\2'
    lines = [re.sub(top_level_regex, top_level_replacement, line) for line in lines]
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ', '', line) for line in lines]
    
    indent = 0
    text_block = False
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        spaces = re.search(r'\S', line)
        if spaces:
            if line[spaces.start()] == '-':
                indent = spaces.start() + 1
                if text_block:
                    text_block = False
                    lines[i] = '\n' + line
            elif spaces.start() < indent:
                text_block = True
                indent = spaces.start()
                lines[i] = '\n' + line
        else:
            text_block = False
            indent = 0
    
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    
    return docstring, block
```

This corrected code should address the issues observed in the provided function and produce the expected output.
