The potential error location within the problematic function is in the block where the leading spaces are removed from each line in the "block" variable. It seems that the calculation for the ending point of the block might be incorrect, which is causing the "block" variable to have extra characters at the end.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is the incorrect calculation of the ending point of the block, resulting in an incorrect substring.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Recalculate the ending point of the block to ensure that the correct substring is extracted.
2. Verify the logic for removing leading spaces from each line to ensure it is working as expected.
3. Use a regular expression to identify and remove the leading spaces from each line more accurately.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else ending_point)]
    
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    
    lines = block.split('\n')
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]

    # Regex for handling list roots
    regex = r'^([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)'
    replacement = r'- __\1__:\2'
    lines = [re.sub(regex, replacement, line) for line in lines]
    
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ', '', line) for line in lines]

    # Fix text lines after lists
    indent = 0
    text_block = False
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        spaces = re.search(r'\S', line)
        if spaces:
            if line[spaces.start()] == '-':
                indent = spaces.start() + 1
                if text_block:
                    text_block = False
                    lines[i] = '\n' + line
            elif spaces.start() < indent:
                text_block = True
                indent = spaces.start()
                lines[i] = '\n' + line
        else:
            text_block = False
            indent = 0
    
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
```
