The bug in the `process_list_block` function seems to be related to incorrectly processing the text blocks and bullet points in the docstring. This results in the incorrect formatting of the documentation for various models and callbacks in Keras.

The potential error location is in the code that handles the processing of bullet points and text blocks in the docstring. It seems like the code is not correctly identifying and formatting the bullet points within the docstring, leading to the incorrect formatting of the documentation.

The bug occurred because the function is not correctly handling the indentation and formatting of the text blocks and bullet points within the docstrings. This leads to the incorrect display of the documentation on the Keras website.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to rewrite the code that processes the text blocks and bullet points within the docstring. This may involve correctly identifying and formatting the bullet points and text blocks based on the indentation and formatting conventions used in the docstrings.

Here's the corrected version of the `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else
                                      ending_point)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    # Update the regex to correctly identify and format list elements
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    - ([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)', r'- __\1__:\2', line) for line in lines]
    # Fix text lines after lists
    indent = 0
    text_block = False
    new_lines = []
    for line in lines:
        spaces = re.search(r'\S', line)
        if spaces and line[spaces.start()] == '-':
            indent = spaces.start() + 1
            if text_block:
                text_block = False
                new_lines.append('\n' + line)
        elif spaces and spaces.start() < indent:
            text_block = True
            indent = spaces.start()
            new_lines.append('\n' + line)
        else:
            text_block = False
            indent = 0
            new_lines.append(line)
    block = '\n'.join(new_lines)
    return docstring, block
```

In the corrected code, I updated the regex pattern to correctly identify and format the list elements in the docstring. I also modified the logic for handling text lines after lists to correctly identify and format the text blocks. These changes should address the bug and ensure that the bullet points and text blocks are correctly processed and formatted in the docstrings.
