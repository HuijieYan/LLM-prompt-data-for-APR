The main issue with the provided function `process_list_block` is that it incorrectly handles the `ending_point` calculation. When `ending_point` is -1, it should not be altered during assignment. 

Furthermore, the slicing logic for `docstring` and `docstring_slice` seems incorrect, as it may lead to incorrect replacement and issues with subsequent operations. 

The buggy function is also expected to perform regex replacement on the strings, and it should handle the list elements and indentation correctly, which may not be happening as expected.

To fix the bug, the correction should include:
1. Storing `ending_point` in a temporary variable and only modifying the `ending_point` if it's not equal to -1.
2. Adjusting the slicing logic for both `docstring` and `docstring_slice` to ensure the correct replacements and avoid any slicing issues.
3. Reviewing the regex replacement logic and list element handling to ensure the correct indentation and processing.

Below is the corrected code for the `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    if ending_point != -1:
        block = docstring[starting_point:ending_point - 1]
    else:
        block = docstring[starting_point:]

    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[:starting_point] + marker + docstring[section_end:]
    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub(r'^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]

    top_level_regex = r'^    ([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)'
    top_level_replacement = r'- __\1__:\2'
    lines = [re.sub(top_level_regex, top_level_replacement, line) for line in lines]

    # All the other lines get simply the 4 leading space (if present) removed
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ', '', line) for line in lines]

    # Fix text lines after lists
    indent = 0
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        spaces = re.search(r'\S', line)
        if spaces:
            # If it is a list element
            if line[spaces.start()] == '-':
                indent = spaces.start() + 1
            elif spaces.start() < indent:
                indent = spaces.start()

        lines[i] = ' ' * indent + line

    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring_slice, block
```

The changes made to the function include correcting the slicing logic, ensuring proper regex replacements, and correcting the list indentation logic. These changes should address the issues outlined in the bug report.
