The buggy function is intended to process a block of text within a larger document string. However, there are several issues that need to be addressed.

The first issue is with the variable `block`. The string slice operation is not correctly including the last character of the `ending_point` due to the use of `- 1`. This causes the last character of the block to be omitted.

The second issue is with the replacement of the `block` within the `docstring_slice`. The position of `block` within `docstring` is identified and replaced with `marker`, but the replacement is not retaining the correct leading spaces.

The third issue is with the handling of the lines within the block. The logic for removing leading spaces and replacing list roots is not functioning as expected.

To fix these issues, the following corrections can be made to the function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:ending_point]  # Correct the string slice operation
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[:starting_point] + docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)  # Correct the replacement logic
    docstring = docstring_slice + docstring[section_end:]

    lines = block.split('\n')

    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]

    # Replace list roots with proper formatting
    lines = [re.sub(r'^- ([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)', r'- __\1__:\2', line) for line in lines]

    # Remove remaining leading spaces
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ', '', line) for line in lines]

    # Fix text lines after lists
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        if line.strip().startswith('-'):
            lines[i] = '\n' + line

    block = '\n'.join(lines)

    return docstring, block
```

These corrections address the issues with string slicing, replacements, and list root formatting in the original function. The revised function should now process the list block correctly.
