The bug in the function `process_list_block` is likely causing issues with formatting lists in the documentation. The function is meant to process a block of text, but it seems to have issues with handling lists and indentation.

The bug likely occurs in the section that processes the indentation of the text and the removal of leading spaces. It seems to be incorrectly handling the formatting of lists and text blocks.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to properly handle list formatting and indentation. This can be achieved by revisiting the logic for handling lists, detecting list roots, and removing white spaces and indentation.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else ending_point - 1)]
    
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point] + docstring_slice + docstring[section_end:])
    
    lines = block.split('\n')
    
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    
    # Process list formatting
    indent = 4
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        # Detect list root and add formatting
        lines[i] = re.sub(r'^    ([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)', r'- __\1__:\2', lines[i])
        
        # Remove 4 leading spaces from each line
        lines[i] = re.sub(r'^    ', '', lines[i])
    
    # Fix text lines after lists
    for i in range(1, len(lines)):
        # Add new line after list element
        if lines[i].strip().startswith('-'):
            lines[i] = '\n' + lines[i]
        # Remove excess spaces
        else:
            lines[i] = lines[i].lstrip()

    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    
    return docstring, block
```

The corrected code includes a revised logic for processing list formatting and indentation. This should address the bug related to incorrect display of bullet points and lists in the documentation.
