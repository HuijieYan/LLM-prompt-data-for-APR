Potential error location: The error may be occurring in the 'process_list_block' function in the lines that handle replacing and removing leading spaces from the lines.

Reason for the bug: The error may be occurring due to the incorrect manipulation of the 'docstring' and 'lines' variables in the function. The handling of the 'block' variable and the manipulation of leading spaces within the 'lines' list may not be done correctly.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: It seems that the function is trying to process a list block within a docstring, so the correction should focus on properly handling the list items and their indentation.

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else
                                      ending_point - 1)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    
    # Process list items
    processed_lines = []
    for line in lines:
        if line.strip().startswith('-'):
            processed_lines.append(f'- __{line.strip()[2:]}__')
        else:
            processed_lines.append(line)
    
    block = '\n'.join(processed_lines)
    return docstring, block
```
