The bug in the `process_list_block` function seems to be related to the handling of the `docstring` and the `block`. The `docstring` and `block` seem to be manipulated incorrectly and not producing the expected output.

The function seems to be incorrectly replacing the `block` in the `docstring` with the `marker` and then replacing the entire section between `starting_point` and `section_end` with the manipulated `docstring_slice`. This might be causing the incorrect output.

The function also splits the `block` into lines and performs various operations on the lines, including removing leading spaces and adding markers. These operations might be incorrectly manipulating the contents of the `block`.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly reconstruct the `docstring` after manipulating the `block`. Additionally, the operations on the `block` need to be revised to produce the expected output.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else ending_point)]
    
    lines = block.split('\n')
    lines = [re.sub(r'^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    
    # Usually lines have at least 4 additional leading spaces.
    # These have to be removed, but first the list roots have to be detected.
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ([^\s\\\\\(]+):(.*)', r'- __\1__:\2', line) for line in lines]
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ', '', line) for line in lines]
    
    indent = 0
    text_block = False
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        spaces = re.search(r'\S', line)
        if spaces:
            if line[spaces.start()] == '-':
                indent = spaces.start() + 1
                if text_block:
                    text_block = False
                    lines[i] = '\n' + line
            elif spaces.start() < indent:
                text_block = True
                indent = spaces.start()
                lines[i] = '\n' + line
        else:
            text_block = False
            indent = 0
    
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    docstring = docstring[:starting_point] + marker + docstring[section_end:]
    return docstring, block
```

The corrected function ensures the correct handling of the `docstring` and `block`. It also performs the necessary operations on the `block` to produce the expected output.

This should resolve the formatting issues related to the bullet points and ensure that the test case `test_doc_lists` passes without any assertion errors.
