Sure, here's the full code of the fixed `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else
                                      ending_point - 1)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub(r'^\s*-\s__(.+?)__:(.*)', r'- __\1__:\2', line) for line in lines]

    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
```

This updated code includes the necessary modifications to accurately process and manipulate the `block` variable, ensuring that the formatting and structure of the docstring are maintained during the processing.
