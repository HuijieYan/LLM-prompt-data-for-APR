The bug in the given function `process_list_block` is that it is not correctly extracting and replacing the block of text from the `docstring`. The ending point is calculated as `starting_point - 1` if `ending_point` is equal to -1 which results in incorrect extraction of the block.

Additionally, the regular expressions used to remove leading spaces and add list markers are not correctly handling the list items and text blocks.

To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Ensure the correct extraction of the block by checking if `ending_point` is not equal to -1 and then extracting the block.
2. Update the regular expressions to correctly handle the list items and text blocks.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point : ending_point if ending_point != -1 else len(docstring)]

    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])

    lines = block.split('\n')
    lines = [re.sub(r'^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]

    lines = [
        re.sub(r'^(\s*)- ([^:\n]+):(.*?)(\n\n|\n\s+|$)', r'\1- __\2__:\3', line)
        for line in lines
    ]

    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ', '', line) for line in lines]

    lines = [
        '\n'.join(re.sub(r'^(\s*)- ', r'\1- ', text).strip() for text in line.split('\n'))
        if line.lstrip().startswith('- ')
        else line
        for line in lines
    ]

    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
```

With these corrections, we ensure that the block of text is correctly extracted and replaced within the `docstring`, and the regular expressions properly handle the leading spaces and list marker additions.
