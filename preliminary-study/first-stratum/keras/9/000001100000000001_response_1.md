The potential error in the `process_list_block` function is that the ending_point is not being correctly handled. If the ending_point is -1, the code is subtracting 1 from it, which causes issues when slicing the `docstring`. Additionally, the regex patterns used to identify list elements and remove leading spaces are not correctly implemented.

The bug occurs because the code does not handle the case where `ending_point` is equal to -1, which happens when `'\n\n'` is not found (i.e., when there is no newline between `starting_point` and `section_end`).

To fix the bug, we should first handle the case when `ending_point` is -1 by setting `None` as the second parameter in the `docstring` slice. Additionally, we should correct the regex patterns used to identify list elements and remove leading spaces.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point: (None if ending_point == -1 else ending_point)]
    
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    # Usually lines have at least 4 additional leading spaces.
    # These have to be removed, but first the list roots have to be detected.
    top_level_regex = r'^([ ]{4})([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)'  # corrected regex pattern
    top_level_replacement = r'- __\2__:\3'  # corrected replacement pattern
    lines = [re.sub(top_level_regex, top_level_replacement, line) for line in lines]
    # All the other lines get simply the 4 leading space (if present) removed
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ', '', line) for line in lines]
    # Fix text lines after lists
    indent = 0
    text_block = False
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        spaces = re.search(r'^\s*', line)  # use '\s*' to match any whitespace
        if spaces:
            # If it is a list element
            if line[spaces.end()] == '-':  # corrected condition
                indent = spaces.end() + 1  # corrected index
                if text_block:
                    text_block = False
                    lines[i] = '\n' + line
            elif spaces.end() < indent:  # corrected condition
                text_block = True
                indent = spaces.end()
                lines[i] = '\n' + line
        else:
            text_block = False
            indent = 0
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
```
