The error is occurring when comparing the expected markdown output with the actual markdown output from the `docstring` variable. The bug is likely in the `process_list_block` function, as it is responsible for modifying the `docstring`.

The bug is likely caused by the incorrect block extraction logic, indentation handling, and list formatting. This resulted in an incorrect `block` and `docstring_slice`, hence leading to incorrect output when comparing the markdown with the expected result.

To fix the bug, the block extraction logic should correctly handle the block and indentation for lists. Additionally, the formatting for the `docstring_slice` should match the expected markdown representation.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else ending_point)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (
        docstring[:starting_point]
        + docstring_slice
        + docstring[section_end:]
    )
    lines = block.strip().split('\n')
    lines = [re.sub(rf'^\s{{{leading_spaces}}}', '', line) for line in lines]
    
    i = 0
    while i < len(lines):
        line = lines[i]
        if line.strip().startswith('-'):
            lines[i] = f'- {line.lstrip("-")}'
        i += 1
          
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    
    return docstring, block
```

The corrected function now applies proper indentation handling for list elements and creates the correct `docstring_slice`. Once this fix is applied, the function should produce the expected markdown output, resolving the error seen in the test case.
