The bug in the provided function seems to be related to processing a docstring and correcting the formatting of a list block within the docstring.

The potential error location within the function is likely the manipulation of the `docstring` variable, particularly when replacing the `block` with `marker`.

The bug may be occurring because the ending point for the block is calculated incorrectly, leading to incorrect slicing of the `docstring`. This can cause issues with replacing the `block` with `marker` and result in incorrect formatting of the list block.

To fix the bug, the calculations for the `ending_point` should be adjusted to accurately capture the end of the block. Additionally, the slicing of the `docstring` to replace the `block` with `marker` needs to be corrected.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point) if docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point) != -1 else section_end - 1
    block = docstring[starting_point:ending_point]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point] +
                 docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker) +
                 docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    
    # Usually lines have at least 4 additional leading spaces.
    # These have to be removed, but first the list roots have to be detected.
    top_level_regex = r'^    ([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)'
    top_level_replacement = r'- __\1__:\2'
    lines = [re.sub(top_level_regex, top_level_replacement, line) for line in lines]
    
    # All the other lines get simply the 4 leading space (if present) removed
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ', '', line) for line in lines]
    
    # Fix text lines after lists
    indent = 0
    text_block = False
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        spaces = re.search(r'\S', line)
        if spaces:
            # If it is a list element
            if line[spaces.start()] == '-':
                indent = spaces.start() + 1
                if text_block:
                    text_block = False
                    lines[i] = '\n' + line
            elif spaces.start() < indent:
                text_block = True
                indent = spaces.start()
                lines[i] = '\n' + line
        else:
            text_block = False
            indent = 0
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    
    return docstring, block
```
