This function `process_list_block` seems to be responsible for processing a block of text, such as a docstring, and modifying it according to certain rules. The bug in this function seems to be related to the incorrect manipulation of the `ending_point` and `section_end` variables. This is likely causing issues in how the block of text is being split and modified.

The bug in this function seems to be causing incorrect splitting and formatting of the text. This could lead to issues with how the documentation is presented in certain cases, such as the incorrect formatting of bullet points in the documentation.

To fix the bug, the function `process_list_block` needs to properly handle the `ending_point` and `section_end` variables. It also needs to ensure that the modifications to the text block are done correctly to maintain the formatting of bullet points and indentation.

Here's the corrected version of the `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else
                                      ending_point)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')

    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]

    # Usually lines have at least 4 additional leading spaces.
    # These have to be removed, but first the list roots have to be detected.
    top_level_regex = r'^    ([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)'
    top_level_replacement = r'- __\1__:\2'
    lines = [re.sub(top_level_regex, top_level_replacement, line) for line in lines]

    # All the other lines get simply the 4 leading space (if present) removed
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ', '', line) for line in lines]

    # Fix text lines after lists
    indent = 0
    text_block = False
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        spaces = re.search(r'\S', line)
        if spaces:
            # If it is a list element
            if line[spaces.start()] == '-':
                indent = spaces.start() + 1
                if text_block:
                    text_block = False
                    lines[i] = '\n' + line
            elif spaces.start() < indent:
                text_block = True
                indent = spaces.start()
                lines[i] = '\n' + line
        else:
            text_block = False
            indent = 0

    block = '\n'.join(lines)

    return docstring, block
```

This corrected version should properly handle the text block processing, leading to the correct formatting of bullet points and indentation in the documentation.
