The issue seems to be related to the formatting of list items in the `block`, which is a part of the `docstring` being processed. The function `process_list_block` is responsible for handling the formatting of the `docstring` and seems to be encountering issues while processing the list items.

The bug occurs because the function is not handling the list items formatting correctly as per the expected output. The list items are not being correctly reformatted and modified.

To fix the bug, the function `process_list_block` needs to be modified to correctly handle the list items and their formatting within the `block` of the `docstring`. This can be achieved by appropriately identifying and reformatting the list items, removing leading spaces, and maintaining the correct structure of the `docstring`.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else
                                      ending_point - 1)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    # Reformat list items as per the expected format
    lines = [re.sub(r'^([ ]*)- __([^:]+): (.+)$', r'\1- <strong>\2</strong>: \3', line) for line in lines]
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
```

In the corrected function, after removing leading spaces from each line, a new step is added to reformat the list items. The new step uses regular expressions to correctly format the list items to have a `<strong>` tag for the list item key and maintains the original value. This should align the list items with the expected output format.

After applying the fix, re-run the test function to verify that the issue has been resolved.
