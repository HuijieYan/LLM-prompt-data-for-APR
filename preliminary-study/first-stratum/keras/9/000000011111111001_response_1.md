The bug is likely caused by the incorrect processing of the `block` variable in the `process_list_block` function, resulting in an incorrect `docstring` and `block`. This is reflected in the assertion error in the test function, where the expected markdown differs from the actual markdown generated from the `docstring`.

The bug may be occurring due to incorrect slicing, replacement, and manipulation of `block`. As a result, the `docstring`, `docstring_slice`, and `lines` variables are being assigned incorrect values.

To fix this bug, the function should accurately slice, replace, and manipulate the `block` to generate the expected `docstring`, `docstring_slice`, and `lines` values.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:section_end]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[:starting_point] + marker + docstring[section_end:]
    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    # Usually lines have at least 4 additional leading spaces.
    # These have to be removed, but first the list roots have to be detected.
    top_level_regex = r'^    ([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)'
    top_level_replacement = r'- __\1__:\2'
    lines = [re.sub(top_level_regex, top_level_replacement, line) for line in lines]
    # All the other lines get simply the 4 leading space (if present) removed
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ', '', line) for line in lines]
    # Fix text lines after lists
    indent = 0
    text_block = False
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        spaces = re.search(r'\S', line)
        if spaces:
            # If it is a list element
            if line[spaces.start()] == '-':
                indent = spaces.start() + 1
                if text_block:
                    text_block = False
                    lines[i] = '\n' + line
            elif spaces.start() < indent:
                text_block = True
                indent = spaces.start()
                lines[i] = '\n' + line
        else:
            text_block = False
            indent = 0
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring_slice, block
```

This corrected function accurately slices the `block` and generates the expected `docstring_slice` and `lines` values. Further testing is recommended to ensure that the function works as expected in all cases.
