The problem occurs when the function `process_list_block` tries to extract and process a block of text from a docstring. It then attempts to modify the docstring and return the processed block of text.

The issue seems to be with the computation of the `ending_point`. When `ending_point` is -1, it is used to slice the `docstring` without adjusting for the specific condition. This leads to incorrect slicing and affects the subsequent processing of the block.

To fix the bug, we should adjust the slicing of the `docstring` based on the condition when `ending_point` is -1. Additionally, the handling of the block of text and the modification of the docstring should be reviewed to ensure the correct manipulation of the text block.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    if ending_point == -1:
        block = docstring[starting_point:]
    else:
        block = docstring[starting_point:ending_point - 1]

    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    
    lines = block.split('\n')
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    top_level_regex = r'^    ([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)'
    top_level_replacement = r'- __\1__:\2'
    lines = [re.sub(top_level_regex, top_level_replacement, line) for line in lines]
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ', '', line) for line in lines]

    indent = 0
    text_block = False
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        spaces = re.search(r'\S', line)
        if spaces:
            if line[spaces.start()] == '-':
                indent = spaces.start() + 1
                if text_block:
                    text_block = False
                    lines[i] = '\n' + line
            elif spaces.start() < indent:
                text_block = True
                indent = spaces.start()
                lines[i] = '\n' + line
        else:
            text_block = False
            indent = 0
    
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
```
