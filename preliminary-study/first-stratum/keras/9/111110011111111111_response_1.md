The issue here seems to be related to the incorrect formatting of the "Arguments" section in the documentation. The function `process_list_block` is likely responsible for processing this section, and it seems to have a number of issues which could lead to incorrect formatting.

One potential issue could be the calculation of `ending_point`. If the 'arguments' section doesn't have a double newline after it, the value of `ending_point` will be -1, which can lead to incorrect processing of the block.

Another issue could be with the `block` variable, which appears to be the content of the 'Arguments' section. The manipulation of this variable may not be done correctly, leading to incorrect formatting.

There are also issues with the processing of the 'lines' variable, where the transformation of the text doesn't seem to be accurate.

To fix this issue, the following steps can be considered:
1. Check the calculation of `ending_point` and ensure that it correctly identifies the end of the 'Arguments' section.
2. Review the manipulation of the `block` variable and ensure that it captures the content of the 'Arguments' section accurately.
3. Verify the processing of the `lines` variable and make sure that the transformations are correct.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else ending_point)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ([^\s\(\)]+):(.*)', r'- __\1__:\2', line) for line in lines]
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ', '', line) for line in lines]
    
    # Fix text lines after lists
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        if line.strip().startswith('-'):
            lines[i] = '\n' + line
        else:
            lines[i] = re.sub(r'^\s{4}', '', line)

    block = '\n'.join(lines)

    return docstring, block
```

With these corrections, the function should now properly process the "Arguments" section in the documentation and provide the expected formatting.
