The bug is likely occurring in the `process_list_block` function, specifically in the part of the code where it handles the text after lists and tries to transform them into HTML-friendly format. The error message from the test function indicates a mismatch in the expected and actual HTML outputs of the processed `docstring`.

The reason behind this bug could be related to the regular expressions used to identify list elements and format them as HTML lists. It seems that the transformation from list elements to HTML list items is not handled correctly due to incorrect regular expressions or logic.

To fix this bug, you should review and update the regular expressions used for list element identification and transformation into HTML list items. Additionally, ensure that the transformation from list elements to HTML list items occurs accurately to match the expected output.

The corrected code for the `process_list_block` function is provided below:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else ending_point)]

    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point] + docstring_slice + docstring[section_end:])

    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]

    # Format list elements as HTML list items
    lines = [re.sub(r'^- (.*)', r'<li>\1</li>', line) for line in lines]

    # Wrap the list with an HTML unordered list tag
    block = '<ul>\n' + '\n'.join(lines) + '\n</ul>'
    return docstring, block
```

In the corrected code, the regular expressions used to format list elements into HTML list items have been updated to accurately identify and transform list elements. Additionally, the list of HTML list items is wrapped with the `<ul>` and `</ul>` tags to represent an unordered list.
