The error message indicates that there is a mismatch between the expected HTML structure and the actual HTML structure. This suggests that there might be an issue with how the function `process_list_block` is modifying the docstring.

The problem might lie within the block where the function processes the list elements and modifies the indentation and formatting of the lines.

One potential reason for the bug could be the mishandling of the list items and their indentation during the processing of the docstring.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to carefully review and test the logic for modifying the list elements within the docstring. This includes handling the indentation, list markers (e.g., '-'), and the corresponding HTML structure.

Based on the analysis, the corrected code for the problematic function `process_list_block` is as follows:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else
                                      ending_point - 1)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    
    # Process list elements
    formatted_lines = []
    for line in lines:
        if line.lstrip().startswith('-'):
            formatted_lines.append(f'<li>{line.lstrip() }</li>')
        else:
            formatted_lines.append(line)
    
    new_block = '<ul>\n' + '\n'.join(formatted_lines) + '\n</ul>'
    return docstring, new_block
```

In the corrected code, a new processing block is added to create a list structure from the given lines of text. Each list item is wrapped in `<li>` tags, and then the resulting list is wrapped in `<ul>` tags to ensure proper HTML structure.
