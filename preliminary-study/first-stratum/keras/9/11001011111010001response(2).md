The error is occurring because the function `process_list_block` is not correctly processing the `docstring` and `block` variables. The function is meant to split a docstring into a description part and a parameter section, but due to incorrect handling of string manipulations, the resulting markdown formatting is incorrect.

The bug is likely occurring because the function does not handle the slicing of the docstring and the block correctly. The logic for capturing the docstring slice and replacing it with a marker seems to be incorrect, leading to issues with the subsequent processing of the lines and indentation.

To fix this bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly capture the docstring slice, remove the leading spaces, detect list roots, and fix text lines after lists. Once these steps are performed correctly, the `docstring` and `block` should be correctly generated to be used in the markdown formatting.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:ending_point]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    # Usually lines have at least 4 additional leading spaces.
    # These have to be removed, but first the list roots have to be detected.
    top_level_regex = r'^    ([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)'
    top_level_replacement = r'- __\1__:\2'
    lines = [re.sub(top_level_regex, top_level_replacement, line) for line in lines]
    # All the other lines get simply the 4 leading space (if present) removed
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ', '', line) for line in lines]
    # Fix text lines after lists
    indent = 0
    text_block = False
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        spaces = re.search(r'\S', line)
        if spaces:
            # If it is a list element
            if line[spaces.start()] == '-':
                indent = spaces.start() + 1
                if text_block:
                    text_block = False
                    lines[i] = '\n' + line
            elif spaces.start() < indent:
                text_block = True
                indent = spaces.start()
                lines[i] = '\n' + line
        else:
            text_block = False
            indent = 0
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
```

This corrected code properly slices the docstring and block, processes the lines by removing leading spaces and fixing text lines after lists, and then returns the corrected docstring and block.
