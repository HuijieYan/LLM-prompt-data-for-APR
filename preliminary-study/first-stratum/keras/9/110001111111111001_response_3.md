The issue seems to be with the `process_list_block` function that is supposed to process a list block in the docstring, apply modifications, and return the updated docstring along with the modified block.

Looking at the expected and actual outputs, it seems like the bug could be caused by incorrect manipulation of the `docstring`, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual values.

The bug occurs because the ending_point calculation is incorrect, leading to an incorrect block being extracted from the docstring. Additionally, the replacement logic and manipulation of lines may not be correct, leading to discrepancies in the expected and actual values.

To fix the bug:
1. Adjust the calculation of `ending_point` to find the correct location for splitting the docstring and extracting the block.
2. Verify the logic for replacing the block in `docstring` using the `marker`.
3. Check the manipulation of `lines` and ensure that the modifications are accurately applied.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    # Adjust ending_point calculation
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n', starting_point)  # Find the next new line character instead of '\n\n'
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else ending_point)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    top_level_regex = r'^    ([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)'
    top_level_replacement = r'- __\1__:\2'
    lines = [re.sub(top_level_regex, top_level_replacement, line) for line in lines]
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ', '', line) for line in lines]
    indent = 0
    text_block = False
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        spaces = re.search(r'\S', line)
        if spaces:
            if line[spaces.start()] == '-':
                indent = spaces.start() + 1
                if text_block:
                    text_block = False
                    lines[i] = '\n' + line
            elif spaces.start() < indent:
                text_block = True
                indent = spaces.start()
                lines[i] = '\n' + line
        else:
            text_block = False
            indent = 0
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
```

With these corrections, the `process_list_block` function should now produce the expected output when called with the provided input values.
