Potential Error Location: 
The issue seems to be occurring in the `process_list_block` function when it tries to slice the `docstring` using the `starting_point` and `section_end` variables. It also seems to have some issues with manipulating the `block` variable and the `docstring` itself.

Reasons for the Bug: 
1. There seems to be a problem in slicing the `docstring` using the `starting_point` and `section_end` variables, as it might be slicing more or less than intended.
2. The manipulation of the `docstring` using string replacement might not be accurate, leading to incorrect positioning of the `marker` in the `docstring`.
3. The handling of the `block`, including the removal of leading spaces and list elements, seems to be error-prone.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the slicing of the `docstring` using `starting_point` and `section_end` is accurate and captures the correct section to be replaced with the `marker`.
2. Revise the manipulation of the `docstring` slice to accurately insert the `marker` at the intended position.
3. Improve the handling of the `block` variable, including the removal of leading spaces and proper list element detection and manipulation.

Corrected Code:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else ending_point)]
    
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = docstring[:starting_point] + docstring_slice + docstring[section_end:]
    
    lines = block.split('\n')
    
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    
    # Usually lines have at least 4 additional leading spaces.
    # These have to be removed, but first the list roots have to be detected.
    top_level_regex = r'^    ([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)'
    top_level_replacement = r'- __\1__:\2'
    lines = [re.sub(top_level_regex, top_level_replacement, line) for line in lines]
    
    # All the other lines get simply the 4 leading space (if present) removed
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ', '', line) for line in lines]
    
    # Fix text lines after lists
    indent = 0
    text_block = False
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        spaces = re.search(r'\S', line)
        if spaces:
            # If it is a list element
            if line[spaces.start()] == '-':
                indent = spaces.start() + 1
                if text_block:
                    text_block = False
                    lines[i] = '\n' + line
            elif spaces.start() < indent:
                text_block = True
                indent = spaces.start()
                lines[i] = '\n' + line
        else:
            text_block = False
            indent = 0
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    
    return docstring, block
