The error message indicates that there is a formatting mismatch between the expected and actual output of the `process_docstring` function when used in the test case `test_doc_lists`.

Upon reviewing the function `process_list_block`, it appears that there are multiple issues with string manipulation and list handling. The bug seems to be occurring due to incorrect handling of list items and formatting when processing the input `docstring`.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to properly handle list items and their corresponding formatting.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else
                                      ending_point - 1)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]

    # Fix text lines after lists
    indent = 0
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        spaces = re.search(r'\S', line)
        if spaces:
            # If it is a list element
            if line[spaces.start()] == '-':
                if spaces.start() > 0:
                    lines[i] = '- ' + lines[i][spaces.start():]
        else:
            lines[i] = ''  # Remove empty lines
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
```

In the corrected code:
- The code responsible for handling list item formatting has been updated to properly identify and format list items.
- Empty lines are removed to ensure proper formatting and display of the processed docstring.
