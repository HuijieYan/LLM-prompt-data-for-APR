The bug is likely located in the `process_list_block` function, particularly in the section where it's modifying the docstring content. The error message from the test function indicates a discrepancy in the HTML output, specifically related to list elements.

The bug seems to be related to the transition from plain text to a list element in the generated HTML output. It appears that the list elements are not being properly converted from plain text to bullet points in the HTML format.

To fix this bug, you should modify the code to correctly handle the transformation of plain text to list elements in the generated HTML output.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else
                                      ending_point - 1)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring = docstring[:starting_point] + docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker) + docstring[section_end:]
    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    # Usually lines have at least 4 additional leading spaces.
    # These have to be removed, but first the list roots have to be detected.
    top_level_regex = r'^    ([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)'
    top_level_replacement = r'- __\1__:\2'
    lines = [re.sub(top_level_regex, top_level_replacement, line) for line in lines]
    # All the other lines get simply the 4 leading space (if present) removed
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ', '', line) for line in lines]
    # Fix text lines after lists
    indent = 0
    text_block = False
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        spaces = re.search(r'\S', line)
        if spaces:
            # If it is a list element
            if line[spaces.start()] == '-':
                indent = spaces.start() + 1
                if text_block:
                    text_block = False
                    lines[i] = '\n' + line
            elif spaces.start() < indent:
                text_block = True
                indent = spaces.start()
                lines[i] = '\n' + line
        else:
            text_block = False
            indent = 0
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, '<ul>\n<li>' + '</li>\n<li>'.join(block.split('\n')) + '</li>\n</ul>'
```

In the corrected code, after processing the block and modifying the docstring, the list elements are wrapped with `<ul>` tags and each item is enclosed within `<li>` tags to ensure the correct conversion to an HTML list.
