The error is occurring because the function `process_list_block` is not correctly formatting the input `docstring`. The function is intended to process a block of text and format it with markdown, but it is not doing this correctly.

The potential error location is in the formatting and manipulation of the `docstring` variable within the `process_list_block` function. The function is trying to process a block of text and format it with markdown, but the processing is not being done correctly.

The bug is likely occurring due to incorrect manipulation of the input `docstring` and incorrect regex matching and replacements.

To fix this bug, we need to correct the regex patterns and replacements, ensure proper indentation handling, and correct the slicing and re-injection of the processed `docstring`.

Here's the corrected version of the `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else ending_point - 1)]

    # Correct formatting
    lines = block.split('\n')
    lines = [line.lstrip() for line in lines]

    # Fix text lines after lists and replace special characters
    indent = 0
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        spaces = re.search(r'\S', line)
        if spaces:
            if line[spaces.start()] == '-':
                indent = spaces.start() + 1
            if spaces.start() < indent:
                indent = spaces.start()
        else:
            indent = 0

        # Replace special characters with markdown
        lines[i] = re.sub(r'^\s*- ', '- ', lines[i])
        lines[i] = re.sub(r'^\s+', '', lines[i])

    block = '\n'.join(lines)

    # Place marker for later reinjection
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point] + docstring_slice + docstring[section_end:])

    return docstring, block
```

This corrected version uses correct regex patterns and replacements, better handling of line indentation, and proper re-injection of the processed `docstring`.
