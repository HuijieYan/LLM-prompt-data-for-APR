The bug occurs in the function because the mean and std variables are calculated differently based on the mode, but their usage is the same regardless of the mode. This results in incorrect preprocessing for mode values other than 'tf' and 'torch'. 

To fix the bug, we need to move the calculation of mean and std outside of the mode-specific conditions and calculate them for all cases. Then, we can perform the preprocessing based on the data_format regardless of the mode value.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        x = np.moveaxis(x, -1, 1)

    mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
    std = [1., 1., 1.]

    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]

    x -= mean
    x /= std
    return x
```
In the corrected function, we first check for the data format and perform the necessary adjustments. Then, we calculate the mean and std values based on the mode and apply preprocessing independent of the mode. This ensures that the function provides the correct preprocessed Numpy array for the input image, regardless of the mode and data format.
