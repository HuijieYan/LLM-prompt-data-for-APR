The error message indicates a problem with the data types being used in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function. Specifically, the error occurs when trying to subtract a mean value from the input array `x`. The error is due to the data type mismatch between the mean value (float64) and the input array `x` (int32).

The bug occurs because the function does not handle different data types properly. It assumes that the input array `x` will always be of the same data type as the mean values, which leads to a data type mismatch and the subsequent error.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the mean values have the same data type as the input array `x`. One way to achieve this is by casting the mean values to the dtype of the input array `x` before performing the subtraction.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.
    
    # Arguments
    x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
    data_format: Data format of the image array.
    mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
    - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
    then will zero-center each color channel with
    respect to the ImageNet dataset,
    without scaling.
    - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
    sample-wise.
    - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
    will normalize each channel with respect to the
    ImageNet dataset.

    Preprocessed Numpy array.
