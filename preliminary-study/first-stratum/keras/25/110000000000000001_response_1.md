Potential error location: The error may occur in the calculation of the preprocessed numpy array based on the mode and data_format provided.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: 
1. In the 'tf' mode, the calculation of x /= 127.5 and x -= 1. is not considering the data_format, which may lead to incorrect preprocessing for 'channels_first' data_format.
2. In the 'torch' mode, the calculation of mean and std is not considering the data_format, which may result in incorrect normalization for 'channels_first' data_format.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Consider the data_format while performing preprocessing operations such as mean subtraction, std division, and color channel swapping.
2. Update the preprocessing calculations based on the given mode and data_format to ensure correct preprocessing for different scenarios.

Corrected code:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x = (x / 127.5) - 1.
        else:
            x = (x / 127.5) - 1.
        return x
    if mode == 'torch':
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x = x / 255.
            mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
            std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        else:
            x = x / 255.
            mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
            std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None
    if std is not None:
        x = (x - mean) / std
    else:
        x = x - mean
    return x
