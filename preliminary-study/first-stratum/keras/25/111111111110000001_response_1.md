The error message indicates a "UFuncTypeError" in the subtract operation specifically with regard to the data type mismatch between "float64" and "int32".

Upon analyzing the code, the possible error location is identified in the block where the "mean" value is subtracted from the input "x" array. The "mean" array holds floating point values, and when these are subtracted from the "x" array which holds integers, it results in the "UFuncTypeError" due to the mismatch in data types.

The bug occurred because the "mean" array values are defined as floating point numbers, and they are directly subtracted from the input array "x" without converting them to integers, creating a data type mismatch.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to convert the "mean" array values to integer data type if the input array "x" is of integer data type. This will ensure that the data type consistency is maintained during the subtraction operation.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """
    Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.
    
    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.
