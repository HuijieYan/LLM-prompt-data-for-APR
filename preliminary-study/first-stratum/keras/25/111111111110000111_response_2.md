The error occurred at line 82 in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function, within the `else` block where `data_format` is neither 'tf' nor 'torch'. Here, the error states that there is a 'UFuncTypeError' when trying to subtract a float dtype value from an integer dtype array.

This error occurred because the input array `x` was of type 'int32'. When trying to perform the subtraction operation `x[..., 0] -= mean[0]`, where `mean` is a list of float values, a UFuncTypeError was raised since the operation was trying to subtract a float value from an integer type array.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the input array `x` is of type float before performing the subtraction operation. This can be achieved by converting the input array to a float type using `x = x.astype('float64')`.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.
