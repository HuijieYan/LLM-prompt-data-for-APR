The error message indicates that there is an issue with data type conversion when subtracting the mean from each color channel for the 'channels_last' data format.

The potential error location within the problematic function is identified where it performs the following operation: `x[..., 0] -= mean[0]`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `x` variable is of integer data type (int32), while the values in the `mean` array are float64. When performing the subtraction, there is a conflict with data type casting, leading to the error.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that all the variables involved in the operations are of compatible data types. In this case, it is best to ensure that the `x` variable is also of float data type.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.
