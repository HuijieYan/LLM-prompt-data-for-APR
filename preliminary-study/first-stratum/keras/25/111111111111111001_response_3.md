The error occurs in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function, particularly in the `else` block where `data_format` is not 'channels_first'. The error message indicates an issue with casting a ufunc output from dtype('float64') to dtype('int32') during the subtraction operation.

The bug occurs because when `data_format` is not 'channels_first', the function performs an in-place subtraction of the mean values from the image array `x`, and the mean values are of type `float`, while `x` is of type `int32`. This causes a conflict in data types leading to the error.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the data types are compatible before performing these operations. One approach is to convert the data type of `x` to `float` before performing the mean subtraction and subsequent operations.

Here's the corrected code for the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert to float before operations
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert to float before operations
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert to float before operations
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert to float before operations
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert to float before operations
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    if std is not None:
        x -= mean
        x /= std
    else:
        x -= mean

    return x
``` 

With these changes, the function should correctly preprocess the input array without causing the type casting error encountered in the test case.
