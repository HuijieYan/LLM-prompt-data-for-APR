The bug in the provided function is in the calculation of the pre-processing values for the input array 'x'. The bug occurs when the mode is 'torch', as the mean and std values are being assigned but not used in the subsequent calculations.

To fix the bug, we need to use the mean and std values to properly pre-process the input array 'x' when the mode is 'torch'.

Here's the corrected code for the 'preprocess_numpy_input' function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
