The test case is checking the output shape of the `utils.preprocess_input` function. The error occurs when `utils.preprocess_input(xint).shape` is compared with `xint.shape`. The error message indicates that the subtraction operation involving arrays of different types (floats and integers) caused a type mismatch.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the block of code that performs pixel-wise normalization and standardization. In the `else` block of the function `_preprocess_numpy_input`, there is a subtract operation (`x[..., 0] -= mean[0]`) that is applied to the input `x`, which is of type `float`, and `mean`, which is an array of type `int`. This type mismatch leads to the error described in the error message.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is the mismatch in data types between the input array `x` and the mean array `mean`. The `x` array is of type `float`, and the `mean` array is of type `int`. This causes a type mismatch when trying to perform math operations between them.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that the `mean` array has the same data type as the input array `x`. This can be achieved by casting the `mean` array to the same data type as `x` before performing the subtraction operation.

Here's the corrected code for the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.
