Potential error location: One key issue in the function is that it does not handle the 'caffe' mode correctly for the channels_first data format.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. The function does not handle the 'caffe' mode correctly for both channels_last and channels_first data formats.
2. When the data format is 'channels_first', the function does not apply the necessary transformations for the 'caffe' mode.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Create a conditional block for the 'caffe' mode that handles both channels_last and channels_first data formats separately.
2. Apply the required RGB to BGR conversion, mean subtraction, and scaling based on the data format and mode.

        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.

            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.
