The bug occurs in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function. When the `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch', it should convert the images from RGB to BGR and zero-center each color channel with respect to the ImageNet dataset, without scaling. However, the function does not handle these cases correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly handle the cases when the `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch'.

Here's the corrected code for the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 4:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[..., ::-1]
            mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]

    # Zero-center by mean pixel and standardize if std is not None
    if std is not None:
        x = (x - np.array(mean)) / np.array(std)
    else:
        x -= np.array(mean)

    return x
