The error message indicates that there is an issue with casting the output of a subtraction operation from 'float64' to 'int32'. This points to a potential issue with data types and arithmetic operations.

The bug occurs because the input to the function is of type 'int32', but the computation within the function leads to a mixed data type operation, resulting in a cast error.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the operations are performed using consistent data types throughout the function, and the final output should be of the same data type as the input.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):

    if mode == 'tf':
        x = np.array(x, dtype=np.float32)
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x = np.array(x, dtype=np.float32)
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        x = np.array(x, dtype=np.float32)
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
```

In the corrected code:
- We ensure that the input 'x' is converted to a NumPy array with data type 'float32' at the beginning of each conditional block to carry out consistent arithmetic operations.
- This ensures that the output 'x' retains the 'float32' data type, consistent with the input, which resolves the cast error.
