The error occurred when the function tried to subtract a mean value from the input array 'x', which was of integer type. This operation caused a type mismatch, leading to the 'UFuncTypeError' due to the inability to subtract a float value from an integer value.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the input array 'x' is converted to a float type before performing arithmetic operations involving floating-point numbers.

Below is the corrected code for the 'preprocess_numpy_input' function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert x to float
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert x to float
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert x to float
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert x to float
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert x to float
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
```

In the corrected code, before performing arithmetic operations or modifying the array 'x', it is first converted to a float type using the `astype('float32')` method. This ensures that the operations involving float numbers are performed correctly, preventing the 'UFuncTypeError' encountered in the original code.
