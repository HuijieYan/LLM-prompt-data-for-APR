The potential error location within the function is in the `if mode == 'torch'` block. The code calculates the mean and std values, but it does not apply any scaling to x based on these values.

The bug occurs because in the 'torch' mode, the function calculates the mean and standard deviation values but does not apply them to the input array 'x'. As a result, the preprocessing for the 'torch' mode is incomplete and needs to be adjusted to correctly preprocess the input in this mode.

To fix the bug, we need to apply the mean and standard deviation values to the input array 'x' in the 'torch' mode.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        # Scale pixels between 0 and 1
        x /= 255.
        
        # Normalize each channel with respect to the ImageNet dataset
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        
        # Apply normalization
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        
        x[..., 0] /= std[0]
        x[..., 1] /= std[1]
        x[..., 2] /= std[2]
        
        return x

    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

        # Zero-center by mean pixel
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
                x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
                x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
                if std is not None:
                    x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                    x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                    x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
            else:
                x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
                if std is not None:
                    x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                    x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                    x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
            x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
            x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[..., 0] /= std[0]
                x[..., 1] /= std[1]
                x[..., 2] /= std[2]
        return x
```
