The bug occurs in the `elif` block of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function, specifically in the part where the mean pixel is subtracted. The bug occurs because the variable `x` is modified in place, leading to unexpected changes in the input array.

To fix this, we can create a copy of the input array `x` before performing any arithmetic operations on it. This will ensure that the original input array is not modified.

Here's the corrected code for the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    x = x.astype('float32')

    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x = np.flip(x, axis=1)
        else:
            x = np.flip(x, axis=-1)
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    x -= mean
    if std is not None:
        x /= std
    return x
```

In the corrected code, we first convert the input array `x` to float32. Then, based on the mode and data format, we perform the preprocessing operations on a copy of the input array `x`. Modifying the array `x` in place has been avoided.
