The bug is located in the `if` statement where the `mode` variable is checked. When `mode` is not equal to 'tf' or 'torch', the variables `mean` and `std` are assigned based on `data_format`, but they are not being used afterwards.

The issue occurs because `mean` and `std` are assigned values based on the condition of `mode`, but the assignment is not conditional on `mode` being 'tf' or 'torch'. This causes an incorrect assignment of `mean` and `std` variables when `mode` is neither 'tf' nor 'torch'.

To fix the issue, the assignments of `mean` and `std` should be separated from the `mode` check and the calculations based on these values should be conditional based on the `data_format`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
    
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        # 'RGB'->'BGR'
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x = x[::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None
    else:
        # 'RGB'->'BGR'
        x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None
    
    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
```
