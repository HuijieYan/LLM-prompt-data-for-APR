The bug occurs when the input parameter `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch', and the `data_format` is 'channels_first'. In this case, the function attempts to access the `x` array using slicing operations that are not valid when the input has 4 dimensions.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the cases where `data_format` is 'channels_first' and the `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch' separately to avoid accessing the `x` array incorrectly when it has 4 dimensions.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # Zero-center by mean pixel
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= 103.939
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= 116.779
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= 123.68
        else:
            mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
