Potential error location:
The error occurs in the calculation of the mean and standard deviation for the 'torch' mode. The mean and standard deviation are calculated and assigned values, but they are not being used to preprocess the input 'x' for the 'torch' mode.

Reason behind the bug:
The bug is occurring because the mean and standard deviation values are being calculated but not used to preprocess the input data for the 'torch' mode.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use the calculated mean and standard deviation values to preprocess the input 'x' for the 'torch' mode.
2. Add the preprocessing steps for the 'torch' mode.

Corrected code:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
            x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
            x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[..., 0] /= std[0]
                x[..., 1] /= std[1]
                x[..., 2] /= std[2]
        
        return x

    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        x -= mean
        std = None
        return x
