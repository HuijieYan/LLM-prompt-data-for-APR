Potential error location: The potential error is in the calculation of the mean and standard deviation for the 'torch' mode.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: 
1. In the 'torch' mode, the mean and standard deviation are calculated but not utilized to preprocess the input.
2. Additionally, there might be potential index out of range errors when applying the mean and standard deviation calculations.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use the calculated mean and standard deviation values to preprocess the input for the 'torch' mode.
2. Ensure that the calculations for mean and standard deviation are done in a way that does not cause index out of range errors.
