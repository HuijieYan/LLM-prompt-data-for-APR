The error message indicates that a ufunc error is occurring in the line `x[..., 0] -= mean[0]`. This is caused by trying to subtract a float (mean[0]) from an integer array (x[..., 0]). Therefore, the data type mismatch is causing this error.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the mean values are of the same data type as the input array `x`. This can be achieved by converting the mean values to the same data type as `x` before performing the subtraction operation.

One approach to fix the bug is to convert the `mean` array to the same data type as the input array `x` before performing the subtraction. This can be done using the `astype` method of NumPy arrays.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.0
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.0
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], dtype=x.dtype)
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225], dtype=x.dtype)
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68], dtype=x.dtype)
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0] -= mean[0]
            x[1] -= mean[1]
            x[2] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0] /= std[0]
                x[1] /= std[1]
                x[2] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[:, 0] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
``` 

With this correction, the function should now be able to handle different input data types without causing the ufunc error.
