Potential Error Location and Reasons:
- The error seems to be occurring when the `mode` is `'caffe'` and the `data_format` is either `'channels_last'` or `'channels_first'`. 
- Inside the `elif` block, regardless of the `data_format`, the same set of transformations are being applied and the function is returning `x`. 

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
- The if-elif-else structure of the function needs to be adjusted to ensure that correct transformations based on `mode` and `data_format` are applied.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """
    Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.
    
    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.
