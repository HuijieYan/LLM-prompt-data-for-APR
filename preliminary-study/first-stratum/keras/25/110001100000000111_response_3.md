Potential Error Location: The bug is likely occurring in the section of the code where the mean and standard deviation are being used to normalize the input array. 

Reason for Bug: The bug occurs because the function is not properly handling the input array when performing mean subtraction and division by the standard deviation.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check that the input array has the correct dimensions and shape for the operations being performed.
2. Ensure that the mean and standard deviation arrays are compatible with the input array and data format.

Corrected Code:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[..., ::-1]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    x -= mean
    if std is not None:
        x /= std
    return x
```
