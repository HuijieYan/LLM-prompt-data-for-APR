The error message indicates that there's an issue with casting the output of a subtraction operation from float64 to int32. This suggests that the variable 'x' is of integer type while the function is attempting to perform operations that require float values. The bug is likely to be in the line where subtraction is being performed: `x[..., 0] -= mean[0]`.

The bug occurs because the input 'x' is of integer type, and the operation attempt to subtract a float value from it. This causes a conflict in the data types which results in the error.

To fix this bug, the input 'x' should be explicitly casted to a float type before any operations that require float values.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = x.astype('float64')
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x = x.astype('float64')
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x.astype('float64')  # Cast to float
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x = x.astype('float64')  # Cast to float
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
