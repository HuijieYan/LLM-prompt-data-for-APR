The error message indicates that there is an issue with the data type casting in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function. It seems that the code is trying to subtract a value of type float64 from an array of type int32.

Upon inspecting the code, the issue can be attributed to the portion where the mean values are being subtracted from the input array `x`. The mean values are of type float, whereas `x` is of type int. This causes the data type casting issue.

To fix this issue, we can convert the mean values to the same data type as the input array before subtracting them from `x`.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = x / 127.5 - 1
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x = x / 255.0
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406])
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68])
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        mean = mean.astype(x.dtype)  # Convert to the same dtype as x
        x -= mean[:, None, None]

        if std is not None:
            std = std.astype(x.dtype)  # Convert to the same dtype as x
            x /= std[:, None, None]
    else:
        mean = mean.astype(x.dtype)  # Convert to the same dtype as x
        x -= mean

        if std is not None:
            std = std.astype(x.dtype)  # Convert to the same dtype as x
            x /= std

    return x
```

In this modified code, `mean` and `std` are converted to the same data type as `x` using the `astype` method before they are used in calculations. This ensures that the data types are compatible and prevents any data type casting issues.
