Potential error location: The potential error location is in the calculation of the mean and std values for the 'torch' mode, and the subsequent normalization process.

Reason for the bug: The bug occurs because the calculation of the mean and std values for the 'torch' mode is incomplete, and the normalization process is not applied correctly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Complete the calculation of the mean and std values for the 'torch' mode by dividing by 255, as well as assigning the calculated mean and std values to the 'mean' and 'std' variables.
2. Apply the normalization process based on the calculated mean and std values for the 'torch' mode.
