The error message indicates that there is an error when trying to subtract a float value from an integer array. This suggests that the incorrect data type is being used for the variable `x`. 

The bug is occurring because in the branch where `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch', and `data_format` is not 'channels_first', the mean values are being subtracted from the input array `x`. These mean values are of type float, but the input array `x` is of integer type. 

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the input array `x` is of the correct data type. We can cast the input array `x` to float before performing operations on it, ensuring that we avoid the mismatch in data type that caused the error.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    x = np.asarray(x, dtype=np.float32)  # Cast input to float

    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
