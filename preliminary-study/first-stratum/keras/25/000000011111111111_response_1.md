The error occurs because when the input array `x` is of type `int32`, the values are not compatible with the subtraction operation when using the `mean` values. The division of an `int32` array by a floating-point value results in a floating-point array, and when subtracting the `mean` values (which are floating-point), it causes the error mentioned in the traceback.

In order to fix the issue, we need to ensure that the `x` array is converted to a floating-point type before performing the operations involving `mean` values.

Here's the corrected code for the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert the input array to float32 type

    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.0
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.0
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], dtype='float32')
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225], dtype='float32')
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68], dtype='float32')
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
```

With this modification, the input array `x` will be converted to a floating-point type before the operations involving the `mean` values, preventing the error described in the test function traceback.
