Potential error location: The if-else logic for mode 'torch' is missing an indentation, causing it to be executed regardless of the mode value.

Reason for the bug: The bug is caused by the missing indentation in the if-else logic, which results in the 'torch' mode not being properly handled.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Indent the code block for mode 'torch' so that it is executed only when the mode is 'torch'.
2. Add handling for mode 'torch' to ensure that the preprocessing is done correctly for this mode.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.
