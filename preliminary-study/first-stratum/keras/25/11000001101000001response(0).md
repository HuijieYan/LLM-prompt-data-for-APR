The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is that it doesn't handle the case when the `mode` parameter is not `tf` or `torch`. In the case when `mode` is not `tf` or `torch`, it tries to access the `mean` list which has not been defined yet. This leads to a `NameError` when the function is executed.

To fix this bug, we can define the `mean` and `std` lists outside of the `if` statements, and then assign their values based on the mode.

Here's the corrected `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode='tf'):
    mean_tf = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
    std_tf = None

    mean_torch = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
    std_torch = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]

    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = mean_torch
        std = std_torch
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = mean_tf
        std = std_tf

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        for i in range(3):
            x[i, ...] -= mean[i]
            if std is not None:
                x[i, ...] /= std[i]
    else:
        for i in range(3):
            x[..., i] -= mean[i]
            if std is not None:
                x[..., i] /= std[i]
    return x
```

After making these changes, the function should work correctly for all modes and data formats. Additionally, the function now includes default values for the `mode` parameter, so it can be called without specifying the mode.
