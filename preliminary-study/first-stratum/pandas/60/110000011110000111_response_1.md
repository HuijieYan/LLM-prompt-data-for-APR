The test case is aiming to apply a custom function to a rolling window of a grouped DataFrame using the `apply` method. The issue arises from the unexpected output of the test due to the incorrect behavior of the `raw` parameter.

The potential error location within the `apply` method is at the condition where `engine` is "cython" and `engine_kwargs` is not None. The implementation currently raises a `ValueError` when `engine_kwargs` is not None, without considering the `raw` parameter.

The reason for the bug is that the `raw` parameter is not being considered when the `engine` is "cython", leading to unexpected behavior in the `apply` method.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to consider the `raw` parameter and its behavior with the "cython" engine. The corrected code for the `apply` method is as follows:

```python
from typing import Dict, Optional, Tuple
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

class YourClass:
    # Corrected apply function
    def apply(
        self,
        func,
        raw: bool = False,
        engine: str = "cython",
        engine_kwargs: Optional[Dict] = None,
        args: Optional[Tuple] = None,
        kwargs: Optional[Dict] = None,
    ):
        if args is None:
            args = ()
        if kwargs is None:
            kwargs = {}
        kwargs.pop("_level", None)
        kwargs.pop("floor", None)
        window = self._get_window()
        offset = calculate_center_offset(window) if self.center else 0
        if not isinstance(raw, bool):  # Check if raw is a boolean
            raise ValueError("raw parameter must be `True` or `False")

        if engine == "cython":
            if raw is True:  # Consider raw parameter for "cython" engine
                if engine_kwargs is not None:
                    raise ValueError("cython engine does not accept engine_kwargs")
                apply_func = self._generate_cython_apply_func(
                    args, kwargs, raw, offset, func
                )
            else:
                raise ValueError("raw must be `True` when using the cython engine")

        # The rest of the elif conditions and the final return statement remain the same
```

With this correction, the `apply` method now properly considers the `raw` parameter when the `engine` is "cython", avoiding the issue described in the bug report.
