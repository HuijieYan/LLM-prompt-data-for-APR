The issue is related to the behavior of the `raw=True` parameter not working as expected when using the `groupby().rolling().apply()` method in Pandas. The expected behavior is to allow the user to pass a numpy array to a rolling user-defined function when `raw=True`. However, the behavior changed in version 1.0.0, causing the `raw=True` parameter to no longer have the expected effect.

The potential error in the code is in the `apply` method of the `_Rolling_and_Expanding` class. Specifically, the issue seems to be related to how the `raw` parameter is handled and the logic for choosing the `engine` type.

The bug occurred due to a conditional statement that did not properly handle the `raw` parameter and the `engine` type. This leads to the functions not being applied appropriately based on the given parameters.

To fix the bug, it is recommended to modify the logic within the `apply` method to properly handle the `raw` parameter and choose the appropriate engine. The conditional statements need to be adjusted to ensure that the correct functions are selected based on the provided parameters.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply` method:

```python
def apply(
    self,
    func,
    raw: bool = False,
    engine: str = "cython",
    engine_kwargs: Optional[Dict] = None,
    args: Optional[Tuple] = None,
    kwargs: Optional[Dict] = None,
):
    if args is None:
        args = ()
    if kwargs is None:
        kwargs = {}
    kwargs.pop("_level", None)
    kwargs.pop("floor", None)
    window = self._get_window()
    offset = calculate_center_offset(window) if self.center else 0
    if engine == "cython":
        if engine_kwargs is not None:
            raise ValueError("cython engine does not accept engine_kwargs")
        apply_func = self._generate_cython_apply_func(
            args, kwargs, raw, offset, func
        )
    elif engine == "numba":
        if raw is False:
            raise ValueError("raw must be `True` when using the numba engine")
        if func in self._numba_func_cache:
            # Return an already compiled version of roll_apply if available
            apply_func = self._numba_func_cache[func]
        else:
            apply_func = generate_numba_apply_func(
                args, kwargs, func, engine_kwargs
            )
    else:
        raise ValueError("engine must be either 'numba' or 'cython'")
    return self._apply(
        apply_func,
        center=True,  # Change to True to ensure center offset is considered
        floor=0,
        name=func,
        use_numba_cache=engine == "numba",
    )
```

In the corrected code, the conditional checks for `engine` and `raw` have been adjusted to ensure that the correct functions are applied based on the parameters. Additionally, the `center` parameter in the `_apply` method has been modified to consider the center offset.
