The test case `test_groupby_rolling` uses the `rolling` function on a DataFrame to perform a rolling window calculation after a `groupby` operation. The error message indicates that the result obtained from the `apply` function in the `apply` method is not as expected.

The potential error location within the `apply` function is likely the conditional branches within the function that check for the `engine` parameter. Based on the error message, it seems that the calculations inside the conditional branches are not producing the expected results.

The bug occurs because the logic inside the `apply` function is not correctly handling the `engine` and `raw` parameters. Additionally, the logic to apply the function in both "cython" and "numba" engines is mismatched, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the conditional logic of the `apply` function needs to be thoroughly reviewed and updated to ensure that the `engine` and `raw` parameters are handled correctly. Additionally, the logic for applying the function in both "cython" and "numba" engines should be implemented in a consistent and dependable manner.

Below is the corrected code for the `apply` function:

```python
from typing import Dict, Tuple, Optional
import pandas as pd

def apply(
    self,
    func,
    raw: bool = False,
    engine: str = "cython",
    engine_kwargs: Optional[Dict] = None,
    args: Optional[Tuple] = None,
    kwargs: Optional[Dict] = None,
):
    if args is None:
        args = ()
    if kwargs is None:
        kwargs = {}
    kwargs.pop("_level", None)
    kwargs.pop("floor", None)
    window = self._get_window()
    offset = calculate_center_offset(window) if self.center else 0

    if engine == "cython":
        if engine_kwargs is not None:
            raise ValueError("cython engine does not accept engine_kwargs")
        apply_func = self._generate_cython_apply_func(
            args, kwargs, raw, offset, func
        )

    elif engine == "numba":
        if raw is False:
            raise ValueError("raw must be `True` when using the numba engine")
        if func in self._numba_func_cache:
            apply_func = self._numba_func_cache[func]
        else:
            apply_func = generate_numba_apply_func(
                args, kwargs, func, engine_kwargs
            )

    else:
        raise ValueError("engine must be either 'numba' or 'cython'")

    return self._apply(
        apply_func,
        center=self.center,  # changed to self.center from 'False' which was hard-coded
        floor=0,
        name=func,
        use_numba_cache=engine == "numba",
    )
```
