Potential error location: The for loop that iterates through the axes and keys may be causing the issue as it does not properly handle non-integer indexes or indexers.

Reasons behind the bug: The function is not handling different types of indexes properly, leading to errors when trying to perform indexing operations.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the type of index and indexer before comparing them.
2. Handle cases where the index and indexer types do not match.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index to avoid fallback.
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not ax.is_integer() and isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```

The corrected code properly checks the type of the index and indexer before performing comparisons and raises a ValueError if the types do not match. This should help in properly handling different types of indexes and indexers.
