Potential error location: 

The error is likely occurring in the for loop where it checks if the axes are integer or not, and then compares the type of the indexer with the type of axis.

Reasons behind the bug:

The bug occurs because the code is not properly handling the case where the key/indexer is not of the same type as the axis. This can lead to incorrect indexing and potentially cause errors.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

1. Use the dtype attribute or isinstance() function to compare types instead of is_integer().
2. Use try-except blocks to handle exceptions and errors when comparing the types of the axis and indexer.

Corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.is_integer():
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
        elif not isinstance(i, int) and ax.is_integer():
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
    
    return key
```
