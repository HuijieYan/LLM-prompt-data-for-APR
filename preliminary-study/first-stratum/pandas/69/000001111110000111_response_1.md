The error is occurring in the `_convert_key` function as it is raising a `ValueError` when it encounters a non-integer index but is provided with an integer indexer. The error message states that "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers."

The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where the index is non-integer and is provided with an integer indexer. As a result, it raises a `ValueError` for this scenario.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function to handle cases where the index is non-integer and is provided with an integer indexer. We can do this by checking the type of the index and the type of the indexer provided and then raising an error if the combination is invalid.

Here is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):  # Check if the index is an integer index
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers")
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int):  # Check if the indexer is an integer
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers")

    return key
```

In this corrected function, we first check the type of the index using `isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index)` and then check the type of the indexer using `isinstance(i, int)`. Based on these checks, we raise an error if the combination is invalid.

This correction ensures that the `_convert_key` function handles different scenarios where the index and indexer are of different types.
