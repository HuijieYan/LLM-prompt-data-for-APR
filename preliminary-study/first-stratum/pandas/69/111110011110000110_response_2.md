# Corrected function/method

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):
    # ... omitted code ...


    # this is the corrected function
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require the keys to be the same type as the index (so we don't fallback).
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not isinstance(i, int):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return key
```
The corrected function now has proper comments and checks for the type of keys based on the index. It also uses the `isinstance()` function to check if a key is an integer.
