The error occurs when trying to access a value in the series using `ser.at[4]` after setting the index to a Float64Index. This causes the `_convert_key` method to raise a ValueError due to the non-integer nature of the index. The issue arises because the `_convert_key` method is not handling the Float64Index properly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` method to handle Float64Index by allowing non-integer indexers for Float64Index.

Here's the corrected `_convert_key` method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not isinstance(i, (int, np.int64, np.float64)):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not ax.holds_integer() and not isinstance(i, (int, np.int64, np.float64)):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```

With this corrected method, it allows non-integer indexers for Float64Index while still ensuring that the keys are the same type as the index. This should resolve the issue with the Float64Index.
