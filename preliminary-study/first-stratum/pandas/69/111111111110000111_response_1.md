Potential error location: The bug is likely occurring within the `_convert_key` method of the `_AtIndexer` class due to the implementation logic.

Reason for the bug: The implementation logic for checking the type of the index and the keys is inconsistent, leading to a ValueError being raised incorrectly.

Approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Revise the logic for checking the type of the index and keys to ensure consistency.
2. Ensure that the appropriate checks are made for integer and non-integer indexes.

```python
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
        
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if pd.api.types.is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

The corrected code above revises the logic for checking the type of the index and the keys to ensure consistency. It also ensures that the appropriate checks are made for integer and non-integer indexes, addressing the bug related to the `ValueError` being raised incorrectly.
