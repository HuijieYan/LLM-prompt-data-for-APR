Potential Error:
The function is attempting to iterate through the self.obj.axes and validate the elements of the key, but it's not handling the case where the key is a single integer.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function assumes that the key is always a list or iterable, and does not handle the case where it's a single integer.

Possible Approach to Fix the Bug:
We can add a check to handle the case when the key is a single integer, and convert it to a list with a single element.

Corrected Code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    if is_setter:
        return list(key) if isinstance(key, (str, list, tuple, set)) else [key]

    if not isinstance(key, (str, list, tuple, set)):
        key = [key]

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
