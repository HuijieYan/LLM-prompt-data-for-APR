The bug occurs in the `_convert_key` function, specifically in the loop that iterates through the axes and checks whether the index type matches the key type.

The bug occurs because the function checks whether `ax` is integer or floating, but it should be checking whether the index type is integer or floating. This is evident from the error message related to "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers" and "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers".

To fix the bug, we need to modify the loop to check whether the index type is integer or floating, and then compare it with the type of the key element `i`. If they do not match, we should raise a ValueError.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """

    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax in self.obj.axes:
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
            if not isinstance(key[0], int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not isinstance(key[0], float):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code should handle the cases where the index is integer or floating point and ensure that the key type matches the index type appropriately, fixing the bug.
