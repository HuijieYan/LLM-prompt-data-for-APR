The error occurs in the `_convert_key` function, specifically in the section where it checks whether the index is an integer and then verifies the type of the key. The error is being raised when the key is not an integer. 

The reason for the error is that the function is not handling non-integer keys correctly for the Float64Index case, which leads to a ValueError being raised.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function to handle non-integer keys for the Float64Index case properly. This can be achieved by checking the type of the index and key, and then performing the necessary verification based on the index type.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """

    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):  # check if the index is of type Float64Index
            if not isinstance(i, (float, int)):  # verify if the key is of type float or int
                raise ValueError(
                    "At-based indexing on a Float64Index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At-based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At-based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                    )
    return key
```

With this correction, the function now properly handles the case for Float64Index and non-integer keys, addressing the error raised in the test function.
