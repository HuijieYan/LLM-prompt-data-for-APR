The error occurred in the `_convert_key` function in the `pandas/core/indexing.py` file. This function is designed to ensure that keys have the same type as the index. The error message indicates that the bug occurs when the input key is a non-integer and the corresponding index is an integer.

The bug occurs because the function is not handling cases where the index type and key type are different. The function should check if the index is non-integer and the key is an integer, and vice versa, and raise a ValueError in those cases.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function to properly handle different types of keys and indices, as described above.

Below is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """

    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At-based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if pd.api.types.is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At-based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )

    return key
```

This modified function properly handles cases where the index type and key type are different, and it now returns the correct key.
