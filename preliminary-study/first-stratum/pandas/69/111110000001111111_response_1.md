The issue seems to be related to checking whether the index is integer or not. In the given code, the function `_convert_key` is supposed to convert the key into a suitable format based on the index. However, it seems that the condition to check whether the index is an integer or not is not correctly handled.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is using the `is_integer` function directly on the index object, which might not be the correct way to determine if the index contains integers or not. Additionally, the condition to check for non-integer indexes is also incomplete.

To fix this bug, the function should be updated to correctly handle the checking whether the index contains integers or not. This can be achieved by using the `is_integer` property correctly and performing necessary checks. Additionally, the logic should be updated to handle non-integer indexes as well.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex):
            # checking if the index is a datetime index
            if not pd.api.types.is_list_like(i) or not all(pd.api.types.is_scalar(v) and isinstance(v, (int, np.integer)) for v in i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a datetime index can only have datetime-like indexers"
                )
        elif isinstance(ax, (pd.NumericIndex, pd.TimedeltaIndex)):
            # checking if the index is a numeric or timedelta index
            if not pd.api.types.is_list_like(i) or not all(pd.api.types.is_scalar(v) and isinstance(v, (float, np.floating)) for v in i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a numeric or timedelta index can only have numeric-like indexers"
                )

    return key
```

This corrected code introduces specific checks based on the type of the index and the type of the values in the key. It uses `isinstance` to check the type of the index and the key values, and raises appropriate errors if the conditions are not met. Additionally, it handles both integer and non-integer indexes.
