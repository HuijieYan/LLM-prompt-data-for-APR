The bug is occurring because the code is checking if the key is an integer by using the `is_integer()` method on the index object. However, in some cases, the key is being passed as a float type and the code is not handling this properly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function to handle float keys by checking for their type and handling them accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """

    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(i, float) and ax.is_integer():
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif isinstance(i, int) and not ax.is_integer():
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                "index can only have non-integer "
                "indexers"
            )
    return key
```

This modified function checks the type of the key and handles float and integer keys accordingly, which should resolve the bug.
