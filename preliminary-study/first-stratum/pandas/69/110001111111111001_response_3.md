The error message is originating from the `_convert_key` function in the `/Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/pandas_69/pandas/core/indexing.py` file.

The error is occurring because the function is trying to verify if the elements in the key are integers or non-integers based on the type of the index, but the implementation is not handling non-integer cases correctly.

The bug can be fixed by modifying the logic for handling non-integer cases. Instead of checking for integer and non-integer conditions separately, a more robust approach would be to check if the index is numeric or non-numeric and then perform validation based on that. Additionally, the condition for non-integer indexer needs to be refined.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, (pd.Float64Index, pd.Int64Index)):
            if not isinstance(i, (float, int)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a numeric index can only have numeric indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, (float, int)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-numeric index can only have non-numeric indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This modified function first checks if the index is numeric (float or integer) and validates the key elements accordingly. If the index is non-numeric, it validates the key elements as non-numeric. This ensures that the key is validated based on the type of the index, fixing the bug in the original implementation.
