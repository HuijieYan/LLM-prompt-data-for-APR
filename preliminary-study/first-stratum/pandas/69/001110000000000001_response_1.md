Potential error location: The error is occurring in the section of code that checks if the index is an integer or not, and then raises a ValueError based on certain conditions. 

Reason for the bug: The bug occurs because the function is checking if the index is an integer using the is_integer() method, which does not exist. It should be using the isinstance() method instead.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: The function should be modified to use isinstance() instead of is_integer() to check if the index is an integer or not.

Corrected code:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(i, int):
            if not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```
