The error occurs when invoking the function `at` on the `ser` object with key 4. The function `_convert_key` is raising a ValueError due to the mismatch of data types (integer and non-integer).

The issue arises from the `_convert_key` function's implementation, where it checks if the index is an integer or non-integer and then compares it with the key. However, the handling of this comparison is incorrect, leading to the ValueError.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function to correctly handle the comparison between the index and the key based on their data types.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):

    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(i, (int, np.integer)):
            if not ax.is_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if ax.is_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this correction, the function now correctly handles the comparison between the key and the index based on their data types, resolving the ValueError issue.
