The bug occurs in the `_convert_key` method of the `pandas.core.indexing._AtIndexer` class when the `At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers` ValueError is raised. This error is associated with the `if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():` condition within the for loop.

The bug occurs because the `is_integer` and `holds_integer` methods are being accessed as attributes and not being called as functions. 

To fix the bug, we need to call the `is_integer` and `holds_integer` methods as functions by adding parentheses after their names. 

Here's the corrected `_convert_key` method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
This fix should resolve the bug and prevent the ValueError from being raised.
