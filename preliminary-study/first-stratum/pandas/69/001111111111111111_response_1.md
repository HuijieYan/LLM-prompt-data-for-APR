The bug occurs in the `_convert_key` method of the `_AtIndexer` class. This method should handle the conversion of keys and enforce certain rules based on the type of index.

The error occurs because the code checks if the index is an integer within the loop that iterates over the index axes. However, it doesn't handle floating-point integer values properly, leading to an incorrect error being raised. Additionally, there is a typo in the error message "on an non-integer" which should be "on a non-integer".

To fix the bug, the code should explicitly handle floating-point integers separately from regular integers. It should also correct the typo in the error message.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not isinstance(i, int) and not i.is_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if not isinstance(i, int) and not i.is_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

This corrected code correctly checks if the index is an integer or a floating-point number and raises the appropriate error based on the type of the key. It also fixes the typo in the error message.
