Potential error location: 

The potential error in the buggy function _convert_key is in the "for" loop where it checks the type of the index for each axis. The conditions inside the "for" loop seem to be incorrect as they are checking if the index is an integer using the function is_integer which is not defined in the function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:

1. The condition `if ax.is_integer():` and `if not ax.holds_integer():` are trying to use undefined methods is_integer and holds_integer.
2. The code does not handle the case where the key is not a list when is_setter is True.

Potential approaches for fixing the bug:

1. Use the built-in function isinstance() to check the type of the key.
2. Handle the case when is_setter is True and the key is not a list.

Corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """

    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        if not isinstance(key, list):
            key = [key]
        return key

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index) and not isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index) and not isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```
In this corrected code, I have used isinstance() to check the type of the key and have handled the case when is_setter is True and the key is not a list. The conditions within the for loop have been modified to use isinstance() to check the type of the index and the key.
