Analysis:
The buggy function `_convert_key` seems to be intended to handle index key conversions and validations when setting and getting values based on the index. It appears to be causing errors given the provided input and output variable types.

Error:
The code is not correctly handling the index axis types, integer and non-integer. The condition checks and validations are incorrect, leading to inappropriate error messages.

Reasons:
The bug occurs due to incorrect type check on index axis elements and validation. Additionally, the condition checks for integer types with `is_integer` method is incorrect, leading to the wrong type validations.

Approach:
1. Validate the index axis type checks properly based on the input key and the type of the index axis.
2. Update the conditions for integer and floating-point element validations correctly.

Code Fix:

```python
from pandas.api.types import is_integer

def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_integer(i) and ax.is_integer():
            continue
        elif not is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
            continue
        else:
            raise ValueError(
                "Invalid value type for index"
            )
    return key
```
