The error occurs in the `_convert_key` function of the `_AtIndexer` class. This function is meant to require the keys to be the same type as the index so that fallback does not occur. However, the type checking and validation in the function is not appropriate, leading to the ValueError being raised.

The bug occurs because the condition for checking if the index is integer is incorrect. Additionally, the subsequent condition checking for non-integer indexes is also incorrect, leading to the ValueError being raised in cases where it should not be.

To fix the bug, the type checking conditions should be modified to correctly handle integer and non-integer indexes.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """

    # Allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a float index can only have float indexers"
                )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex):
            if not isinstance(i, pd.Timestamp):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a datetime index can only have datetime indexers"
                )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.TimedeltaIndex):
            if not isinstance(i, pd.Timedelta):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a timedelta index can only have timedelta indexers"
                )
        else:
            raise ValueError("Unsupported index type")

    return key
```

This corrected code includes proper type checking for different types of indexes (`Float64Index`, `DatetimeIndex`, and `TimedeltaIndex`) and appropriate error handling to ensure that the keys match the types of the index, preventing the ValueError from being raised incorrectly.

These changes should address the bugs identified in the test cases and error messages.
