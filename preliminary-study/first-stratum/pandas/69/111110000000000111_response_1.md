The bug is occurring in the `_convert_key` method of the `_AtIndexer` class. This method is supposed to ensure that the keys are the same type as the index, but it has issues with handling integer and non-integer indexes.

The potential error location is within the loop that iterates through the axes and corresponding keys. It is not properly checking for the type of index and key and is raising ValueError incorrectly.

The bug is occurring because the method is not correctly handling the cases where the index and key types do not match.

To fix the bug, we can modify the loop to properly check the types of index and key and raise ValueError if there is a mismatch. Additionally, we can simplify the code for handling the setter case.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` method:

```python
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """

        # handle arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
                if not isinstance(i, int):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if isinstance(i, int) and not isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

This corrected method now properly handles the integer and non-integer index cases and raises ValueError for mismatched types between index and key.
