It appears that the issue is with the `_convert_key` method inside the `_AtIndexer` class. This method is used for converting the key based on certain conditions and returning the converted key. The error message indicates that the issue lies within this method due to its inability to handle certain cases, specifically related to non-integer indexes and non-integer indexers.

The bug seems to be occurring because the `_convert_key` method is not able to handle the cases where the index is non-integer and the indexer is integer, or vice versa.

To fix this bug, it's important to modify the `_convert_key` method to correctly handle the cases where the index and indexer types differ. The method should be updated to determine the type of both the index and the indexer and then perform the required checks and conversions accordingly.

Here's the corrected `_convert_key` method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # Allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

By making these changes, the `_convert_key` method can handle the cases where the index and indexer types differ, thus preventing the ValueError from being raised.

This corrected version of the `_convert_key` method should resolve the issue and allow the test cases to pass without errors.
