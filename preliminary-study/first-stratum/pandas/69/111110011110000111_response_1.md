The error occurs in the `_convert_key` method of the `_AtIndexer` class. This method is used to convert the key before performing indexing operations. The error message indicates that there is a problem with non-integer indexers for the `At`-based indexing on a non-integer index.

The reason behind the bug is that the `_convert_key` method does not handle non-integer indexers properly, which leads to a `ValueError` being raised.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_convert_key` method to properly handle non-integer indexers.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index (so we don't fallback).
    """

    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if pd.api.types.is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )

    return key
```

In the corrected code, we use `pd.api.types.is_integer` to check if the indexer is an integer, and we also check if the axis holds integers as well. This should fix the issue with non-integer indexers causing `ValueError` in `At`-based indexing.
