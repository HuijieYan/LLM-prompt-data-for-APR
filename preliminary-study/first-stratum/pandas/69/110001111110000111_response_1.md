1. The test case is testing the behavior of the `get_value` method for `Float64Index`. It creates a `Series` with `DatetimeIndex` or `TimedeltaIndex` values and sets its index to `Float64Index`.

2. The error occurs in the `_convert_key` method of the `pandas.core.indexing` module.

3. The bug occurs because the `_convert_key` method is checking integer compatibility for keys when indexing on an index that is not of integer type. When the index is `Float64Index`, the key should be a float and not an integer. The condition `if ax.is_integer()` is causing the bug as it returns False for `Float64Index`, triggering the exception.

4. To fix the bug, the method should check if the index is of type `Float64Index` and ensure that the key is also a float. Additionally, it should handle the corner cases for `get_value` method when using a `Float64Index`.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index) and not isinstance(i, float):
            raise ValueError("At based indexing on a Float64 index can only have float indexers")
        elif ax.is_integer() and not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError("At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers")
        elif pd.api.types.is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
            raise ValueError("At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers")
    return key
```

This corrected code specifically handles the case where the index is of type `Float64Index` and ensures that the key is also a float. It also handles the integer and non-integer index cases for other index types.
