The function `_convert_key` has a bug where it doesn't properly handle the given input parameters and tries to compare integer and non-integer index types without appropriate checks. The bug causes incorrect error messages to be raised, resulting in incorrect behavior of the function.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the data type checks and comparisons using the following corrections:
1. Validate the type of the input parameters, especially the `key` which is a tuple.
2. Check if the index type matches the type of elements in the tuple key. If they don't match, raise an appropriate ValueError.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    # Allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an non-integer index "
                "can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
        elif not is_integer(i) and ax.holds_integer():
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```

With these corrections, the function should handle both integer and non-integer index types properly and raise appropriate error messages if the types do not match.
