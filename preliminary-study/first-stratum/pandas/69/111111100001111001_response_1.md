The `_convert_key` function checks whether an index is of integer type and whether the key/multi-index values are integers. If not, it raises a ValueError. 

The issue here is that when the function tries to compare the types of the index and the key values, it's using an incorrect condition (involving the `is_integer` method) and the comparison fails.

To fix this, we need to check for the presence of `is_integer` and `holds_integer` methods on the index, as well as the type of key values, and perform appropriate comparisons.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)
    
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if hasattr(ax, "is_integer"):
            if not isinstance(i, int) and not (isinstance(i, float) and i.is_integer()):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) or (isinstance(i, float) and i.is_integer()):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

In this corrected code:
- We check if the index (`ax`) has an `is_integer` method, and if it does, compare the type of key values accordingly.
- If it doesn't have an `is_integer` method, we assume it has an `holds_integer` method, and compare the key types as necessary.
- If the conditions are not met, a ValueError is raised.

This should fix the issue with the incorrect type comparison and solve the bug.
