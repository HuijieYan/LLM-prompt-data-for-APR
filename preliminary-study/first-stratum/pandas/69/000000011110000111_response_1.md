The error message indicates that there is an issue with the `_convert_key` function in the code. The function is not handling non-integer indexes correctly, which is resulting in a ValueError.

The error is occurring because the function is not correctly validating non-integer indexes when using at based indexing. This is causing the ValueError to be raised.

To fix this bug, the function `_convert_key` needs to be modified to handle non-integer indexes correctly when using at based indexing.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:  # Handling non-integer indexes
            if not is_integer(i) and ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

By making this modification, the function will correctly handle non-integer indexes when performing at based indexing, which should resolve the bug.
