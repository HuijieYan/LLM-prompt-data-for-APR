The error occurs in the `_convert_key` method when the unconventional format of input key triggers the condition to raise a `ValueError`.

The bug occurs because the `_convert_key` method does not handle the case where the input key is a non-integer index and the indexer is an integer.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` method to handle these cases by checking the types of the index and the indexer.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.is_integer():
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
        elif isinstance(i, float) and not ax.is_floating():
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-floating index can only have non-floating indexers"
            )
    return key
```

With these changes, we handle the cases where the input key and the indexer don't match the type of the index, avoiding the previous `ValueError` by checking the types and properties of the index and the indexer before raising any errors.
