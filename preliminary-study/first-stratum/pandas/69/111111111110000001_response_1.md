The error message is indicating that the function `_convert_key` is raising a `ValueError` when it encounters a non-integer index. The error is arising from the section of code that is checking the index type and raising a `ValueError` when it doesn't match the expected type.

The potential error location is within the for loop that iterates through `self.obj.axes` and checks the type of each index. This section of code is responsible for verifying if the index is of the expected type and raising an error if it doesn't match.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is a mismatch between the expected index type and the actual index type. The function is not handling non-integer index types properly, leading to the `ValueError` being raised.

To fix the bug, the function `_convert_key` needs to handle non-integer index types correctly. This can be achieved by modifying the code within the for loop to check for non-integer index types and handle them appropriately without raising an error.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if not is_integer(i) and not ax.is_integer():
                    # Handle non-integer index types here without raising an error
                    # For example, you can perform additional processing or return the key as is
                    pass
        return key
```
In the corrected code, when encountering a non-integer index type, the function now handles it without raising a `ValueError`. Depending on the specific behavior desired, additional processing can be performed to handle non-integer index types appropriately.
