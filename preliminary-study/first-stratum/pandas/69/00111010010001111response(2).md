The error is occurring in the `_convert_key` function within the `_AtIndexer` class. The function is intended to convert the key into a suitable format for indexing, but it contains a logic error that is causing it to raise a ValueError in certain cases.

The reason for the bug is that the `_convert_key` function is not correctly handling the cases when the index contains floating-point values, specifically with a Float64Index and a Series. In these cases, the function should allow non-integer indexers.

To fix this bug, the `_convert_key` function needs to be updated to properly handle non-integer indexers when the index contains floating-point values.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i) and not pd.api.types.is_floating(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This updated code checks if the indexer is not an integer and not a floating-point number when the index doesn't hold integers. It ensures that non-integer indexers are allowed in cases where the index contains floating-point values.
