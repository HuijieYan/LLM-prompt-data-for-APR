The buggy function in question is intended to convert a key for indexing in a pandas DataFrame. However, the function seems to be incorrectly implemented, primarily because it checks whether the elements of the key are integers, but it doesn't handle floating-point comparison correctly. 

In the buggy function, the code is checking whether the index elements are integer using the method `ax.is_integer()`. However, the issue arises when the key element is of type `float`. The comparison between the key and the index element will fail, leading to a potential error.

To fix this bug, a simple approach would be to convert the key elements to integers before performing comparisons with the index elements. This conversion is suitable because the index is usually of type `int` or `float`, so we need to ensure the comparison types match.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                if isinstance(i, float) and i.is_integer():
                    i = int(i)
                else:
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

By explicitly checking for `float` types and converting them to `int` where appropriate, we can ensure that the comparisons between the key elements and the index elements are performed correctly.
