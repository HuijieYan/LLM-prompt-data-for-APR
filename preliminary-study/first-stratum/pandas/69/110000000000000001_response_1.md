The bug in the provided function is that the function is attempting to call methods or access attributes that do not exist, such as `is_integer()` and `holds_integer()`.

Reason for the bug:
1. The function is attempting to call methods `is_integer()` and `holds_integer()` on the `ax` object, assuming that `ax` is an instance of some class that has these methods. However, these methods are not standard methods for any Python built-in class or common third-party library class.

2. Additionally, `is_integer(i)` is also a buggy line. It seems to be intended to check if the variable `i` is an integer, but there is no such built-in function in Python.

Approach for fixing the bug:
1. To check if a variable is an integer, we can use the `isinstance()` function. For example, `isinstance(i, int)` would return True if `i` is an integer.

2. If the intention was to check if the value is a float and has no decimal part, we can use `i.is_integer()` if `i` is a float. If `i` is a string representing a numeric value, we can first convert it to a float using `float(i)` and then use `is_integer()` method.

Additionally, the function could benefit from improved variable names and clearer comments.

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Requires the keys to be the same type as the index, so we don't fallback.
    """

    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for axis, value in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(value, int):
            if not isinstance(axis, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "Integer indexers can only be used with integer indexes."
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(value, float):
                if not axis.is_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "Non-integer indexers can only be used with non-integer indexes."
                    )
    return key
```
