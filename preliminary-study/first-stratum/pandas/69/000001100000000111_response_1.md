Potential Error Location: The error may be occurring in the for loop where it checks if the index is an integer or not.

Reasons for Bug Occurrence: The bug may be occurring because the comparison between the index and the value in the list may not be handled correctly, causing the ValueError to be raised incorrectly.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
- Check if the index and value type comparison is handled correctly.
- Ensure that the logic for checking integer or non-integer indexers is accurate.

Corrected Code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not ax.is_integer() and isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                "index can only have non-integer "
                "indexers"
            )
    return key
```
