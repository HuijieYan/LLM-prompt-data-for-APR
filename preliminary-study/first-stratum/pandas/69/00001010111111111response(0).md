The error is occurring in the `_convert_key` function. The code within this function is checking if the index is an integer, and if it is, it is checking if the key is an integer. If the index is not an integer, it is checking if the key is a non-integer.

The issue seems to be with the check inside the for loop. It is checking `is_integer(i)` and `ax.holds_integer()`. These checks are not correctly matching the data types and failing to handle cases where the key and index data types are not matching.

To fix this issue, we should check the type of the index (`ax`) and the type of the key (`i`) separately instead of using the `is_integer` and `holds_integer` methods. Based on the expected variable values, we should perform the following checks:

If the index type is an integer type and the key is of a different type, raise a ValueError indicating that the key should be of the same type as the index.

If the index type is not an integer type and the key is an integer type, raise a ValueError indicating that the key should not be an integer.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index) and not isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index) and isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```

This way, we handle the cases where the key and the index types do not match and raise appropriate ValueErrors for the same.
