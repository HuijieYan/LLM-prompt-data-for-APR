The bug occurs because the function is checking for integer and non-integer indexers using the `is_integer()` and `holds_integer()` methods on the index. However, the `is_integer` and `holds_integer` methods are not defined for the `Float64Index` class. This is causing the function to throw errors when it tries to call these methods.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to handle the `Float64Index` class differently. We can remove the `is_integer()` and `holds_integer()` checks and instead rely on the type of the index and the type of the key to determine the validity of the indexing.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(i, int) and not isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-datetime index "
                "can only have non-datetime indexers"
            )
    return key
```

In this corrected function, we are using the `isinstance` function to check if the indexer is an integer and if the index is not a `DatetimeIndex`. This approach ensures that we handle the `Float64Index` case correctly and avoids the errors encountered in the original function.
