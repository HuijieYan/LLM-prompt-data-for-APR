The issue seems to be related to the `_convert_key` method in the `pandas.core.indexing` module. The method attempts to convert the provided key into a specific format based on the index. The error message indicates that the issue arises from the key conversion process when performing a look-up operation.

The error message states that "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers." This suggests that there is a problem in the key conversion logic, leading to an error when trying to perform indexing on non-integer indexes with integer key values.

To fix this issue, the `_convert_key` method should be updated to handle both integer and non-integer indexes properly. It should check the type of the index and the type of the key before performing comparisons and raising errors. Additionally, it should address the specific cases mentioned in the error message.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code includes checks for the index type and the key type before raising any errors. It addresses the specific cases mentioned in the error message and aims to handle both integer and non-integer indexes properly.
