The error message indicates a ValueError being raised within the `_convert_key` method of the `_AtIndexer` class. Specifically, the error message mentions that "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers."

Upon analyzing the provided code, it appears that the issue lies in the logic of the `_convert_key` method. This method is responsible for converting the key used in indexing operations. It checks whether the index axes are integers and whether the provided key is also an integer. If the axis is not an integer, it checks whether the key is a non-integer.

The bug occurs because the logic for checking the non-integer key with a non-integer index is incorrect. It is currently raising a ValueError if the key is an integer and the index is non-integer. However, it should allow non-integer keys for non-integer indexes.

To fix this bug, the logic in the `else` block of the `_convert_key` method should be modified to allow non-integer keys for non-integer indexes.

Here is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_integer(i) and ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this correction, the `_convert_key` method should now correctly handle cases where the index is non-integer, allowing non-integer keys for non-integer indexes.
