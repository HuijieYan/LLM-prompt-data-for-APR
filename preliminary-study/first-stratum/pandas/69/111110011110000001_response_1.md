The error message indicates a ValueError raised at line 2128 in pandas/core/indexing.py, which is caused by the `key` being passed to the `_convert_key` method. The `_convert_key` method is trying to check whether the index is an integer and then comparing it with the input key. The error arises when the index is non-integer but the key is an integer.

The bug occurs because the `_convert_key` method is not properly handling the case where the index is non-integer but the key is an integer. This causes a ValueError to be raised, leading to the test failures.

To fix this bug, the `_convert_key` method needs to be modified to properly handle the case where the index is non-integer but the key is an integer. This can be done by checking the type of the index and key and raising an appropriate error message if they are mismatched.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not ax.is_integer() and is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )

    return key
```

This corrected method checks the type of the index and key and raises the appropriate ValueError based on the type mismatch.
