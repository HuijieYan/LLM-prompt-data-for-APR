Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the for loop where it iterates through the axes of the object and checks if the index is an integer or not.

Reasons behind the bug: It seems that the condition for checking whether the index is an integer or not is incorrect, leading to the inappropriate ValueError being raised.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: The condition for checking whether the index is an integer or not needs to be corrected based on the requirements of the function.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not isinstance(i, (int, np.integer)):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not ax.is_integer() and isinstance(i, (int, np.integer)):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                "index can only have non-integer "
                "indexers"
            )
    return key
```
