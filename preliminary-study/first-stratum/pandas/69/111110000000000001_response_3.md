Potential error: The function is not properly handling the checking of index types. It is not correctly validating whether the key is of the same type as the index.

Reason for the bug: The function is not properly checking if the key is of the same type as the index, leading to potential issues when accessing elements based on the index.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Modify the function to properly compare the type of the key with the type of the index, and raise appropriate ValueError messages when the types do not match.

Corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. 
    """

    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
