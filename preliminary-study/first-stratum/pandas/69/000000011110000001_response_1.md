The error message is a ValueError indicating that At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers. This error occurs when the function _convert_key is called with a non-integer key, and it fails to handle it correctly.

The potential error is within the _convert_key function where it checks the type of the index and key to ensure they are compatible for indexing. The function currently raises a ValueError when it encounters a non-integer key while validating that the index and key types match.

To fix this bug, we can modify the _convert_key function to handle non-integer keys more gracefully. One possible approach is to allow conversion of non-integer keys to match the type of the index if the index allows non-integer keys. This would prevent the ValueError from being raised and allow for consistent behavior when using non-integer keys for indexing.

Here's the corrected code for the _convert_key function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index (so we don't fallback).
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if ax.holds_integer() and not is_integer(i):
                # Convert non-integer keys to match the type of the index
                i = ax._convert_scalar_indexer(i, kind="loc")
        return key
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to convert non-integer keys to match the type of the index when the index allows non-integer keys. This should prevent the ValueError from being raised and handle non-integer keys gracefully.
