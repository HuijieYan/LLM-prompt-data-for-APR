The bug occurs in the if-else block where the function is checking whether the index is an integer type or a non-integer type.

The error message checks for two conditions:
1. If the index is an integer index, then the indexer should also be an integer.
2. If the index is a non-integer index, then the indexer should also be non-integer.

The bug occurs because the function is confusing the terms "integer" and "floating-point number". The check for integer or non-integer should actually be whether the index is an integer type or a non-integer type, and correspondingly, the indexer should be an integer or non-integer type, respectively.

To fix this bug, we need to update the conditions in the if-else block to check whether the index is an integer type or not, and then appropriately compare the indexer to the type of the index.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index) or isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, (int, np.int64, np.int32)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not isinstance(i, (float, np.float64, np.float32)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

In the corrected function, we use the `isinstance` method to check if the index is of type `pd.Int64Index` or `pd.Float64Index` (which includes integers and floating-point numbers). Depending on the type of the index, we check the type of the indexer and raise a ValueError if it does not match the expected type, as described in the error message.
