The error message indicates that the function `_convert_key` is raising a `ValueError` with the message "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers". This error occurs because the function is trying to compare the index type and the key type, and if the index contains non-integer values, it expects the key to also be non-integer.

The issue is likely with the condition in the `for` loop where the function is checking if the index is an integer type using `ax.is_integer()` and then comparing it with the key type. This condition seems to be incorrect, leading to the `ValueError` being raised incorrectly.

To fix this issue, the function should instead check if the index and the key share the same type, regardless of whether they are integer or non-integer types. This can be achieved by comparing the types directly without relying on the `is_integer()` method.

The corrected function is provided below:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/pandas_69/pandas/core/indexing.py

def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if type(ax) != type(i):
            if ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
            elif not ax.is_integer() and is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this correction, the function will compare the types of the index and the key, ensuring they are compatible regardless of whether they are integer or non-integer types.
