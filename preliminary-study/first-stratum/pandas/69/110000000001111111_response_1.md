The bug occurs in the `_convert_key` function, specifically in the code block where it checks for the type of the index and the type of the indexer. The function is intended to check if the index and indexer have matching types, but the type checking logic is incorrect and does not align with the expected behavior.

The bug occurs because the function mistakenly checks if the indexer is an integer using the `is_integer()` method, which does not exist. Instead, it should be using the `is_integer()` method of the `i` variable to check if it's an integer.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly check the type of the indexer and compare it with the type of the index. 

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index to avoid fallback.
    """

    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_type('integer'):
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        elif ax.is_type('floating'):
            if not isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            # non-numeric index
            if isinstance(i, (int, float)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-numeric index can only have non-numeric indexers"
                )
    return key
```

In the corrected code, the method `is_integer()` has been replaced with `is_type('integer')` and `is_type('floating')` for checking if the axis is of integer type or floating type. We also use `isinstance(i, int)` and `isinstance(i, float)` to check if the indexer is of the expected type.

This corrected code properly handles the different types of indexes and their corresponding indexers, ensuring that they match according to their types.
