The error message indicates that there is an issue with the `_convert_key` method in the `IndexingMixin` class. This issue occurs in certain corner cases when using `dti.get_value` and `Float64Index.get_value`.

The bug occurs when the `_convert_key` method tries to validate the data type of the keys against the index. The code contains checks to ensure that the key and index have compatible data types based on whether the index is an integer or not. However, these checks are not handling all cases correctly, resulting in the ValueError being raised.

To fix this bug, you can modify the `_convert_key` method to handle all possible cases where the keys may not match the index types correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """

    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if pd.api.types.is_integer(i) and not pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype(ax):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This modified code uses `pd.api.types.is_integer` and `pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype` to correctly check the data types of the keys and the index. This should address the corner cases where the bug is occurring.
