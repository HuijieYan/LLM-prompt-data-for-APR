The potential error in the given function lies in the condition checks for integer and non-integer indexers. It seems that the function is trying to validate the type of indexers based on the axis type. However, there are some issues with the condition checks and the usage of undefined functions.

The bug occurred because the function is_integer() and is_integer() are not defined within the function. Additionally, the condition checks for the type of indexers based on the axis type seem to be incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to use the isinstance() function to check the types of indexers and axes. We also need to handle the case when the index and key do not have the same length.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    if len(key) != len(self.obj.axes):
        raise ValueError("Key length does not match the number of axes")

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers")
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) or isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers")
    return key
```
