The bug in the function `_convert_key` seems to be related to checking whether the index is an integer or not. It is comparing the index to the axes of the object and raising a ValueError if the type does not match. The function is also supposed to allow arbitrary setting when `is_setter` is True, but it is not doing so effectively.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to handle arbitrary setting correctly and to check the type of the index against the type of the axis in a more effective way.

Here is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)
    
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if not isinstance(i, int) and ax.is_integer():
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif isinstance(i, int) and not ax.is_integer():
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```

In this corrected version, we first check if the operation is a setter, and if so, we simply return the key as a list. For the getter operation, we iterate through the axes and the key together, and for each pair, we check if the type of the index matches the type of the axis. If not, we raise a ValueError. This should resolve the bug in the function.
