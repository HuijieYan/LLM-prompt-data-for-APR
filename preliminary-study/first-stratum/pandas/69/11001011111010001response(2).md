The bug occurs due to the misuse of the `is_integer()` and `holds_integer()` methods which don't exist in the `Index` class of pandas. These methods should be replaced with the `is_floating()` method to check if the index values are floating-point numbers or not.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_floating():  # checking if the index is a floating-point number
            if not isinstance(i, float):  # checking if the indexer is also a floating-point number
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
        else:  # when the index is not a floating-point number
            if isinstance(i, float):  # checking if the indexer is a floating-point number
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this correction, the function should behave as expected and pass the provided test cases without raising the ValueError.
