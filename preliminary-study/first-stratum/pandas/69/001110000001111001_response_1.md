Potential bug location: 

The potential bug location is within the if-else conditions that compare the data types of the index and the key before returning the key. 

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:

The bug occurs because the function is not handling the cases where the index is a datetime or timedelta data type. The function currently only checks for float and integer data types, so it fails when the index type is not float or integer.

Approaches for fixing the bug:

We can fix the bug by adding conditions to check the data type of the index. If the index is datetime or timedelta, we can compare the type of the key to datetime or timedelta type respectively.

Corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, (pd.DatetimeIndex, pd.TimedeltaIndex)) and not isinstance(i, (pd.Timestamp, pd.Timedelta)):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a datetime or timedelta index can only have datetime or timedelta indexers"
            )
        elif ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```
This corrected function checks the data type of the index and the key, and raises a ValueError if they are not compatible. It includes conditions for datetime and timedelta types in addition to float and integer types.
