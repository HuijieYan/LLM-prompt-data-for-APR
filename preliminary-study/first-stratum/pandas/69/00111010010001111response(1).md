The problem occurs within the `_convert_key` function. The function is attempting to check if a given key is an integer, but it's not doing so correctly. It checks if the value is an integer using `is_integer(i)`, but it should be using `isinstance(i, int)` instead.

Additionally, there is a typo in the error message where "an non-integer" should be "a non-integer".

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This should fix the bug and ensure that the function correctly checks if a given key is an integer.
