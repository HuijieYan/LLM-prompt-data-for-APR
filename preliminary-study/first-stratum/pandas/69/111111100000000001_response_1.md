Potential error location: The potential error location within the problematic function is in the if-else statement where it checks if the index is an integer and if the indexer is an integer or not.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because of the incorrect logic in the if-else statement. The condition for checking if the indexer is an integer or not is not accurately implemented.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: The condition inside the loop for checking whether the indexer is an integer or not needs to be revised to accurately check the type and validity of the indexer.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not ax.is_integer() and isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                "index can only have non-integer "
                "indexers"
            )
    return key
```
