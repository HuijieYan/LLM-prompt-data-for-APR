The bug in the provided function is that it is unable to handle non-integer indexers properly. It checks if the index is an integer but fails to consider non-integer indexers. The function also tries to consider the type of index such as datetime or timedelta, but it doesn't handle the floating point indexers well.

To fix the bug, the function should first check the type of the index, whether it's integer, floating point, or other types. Then, it should handle the indexers accordingly.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers")
        elif ax.is_floating():
            if not isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on a floating point index can only have floating point indexers")
        else:
            if (isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer()) or (isinstance(i, float) and ax.is_floating()):
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers")
    return key
```

This corrected function now checks the type of index (integer, floating point, or other types), and then checks the type of indexers accordingly. The type checking has been modified to check if the indexers are of the expected type based on the index type.
