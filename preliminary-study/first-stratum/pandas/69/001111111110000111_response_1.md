Based on the error message, the issue occurs in the `_convert_key` method of the `_AtIndexer` class in the `pandas/core/indexing.py` file. The error is raised when an attempt is made to use `ser.at[4]`, indicating that the `key` parameter being passed to the `_convert_key` method might not be properly handled.

The reason for this bug is that the `_convert_key` method is not handling all possible cases of the `key` parameter properly. It assumes that `key` will always have the same format as the index and does not account for the case when `key` could be a single value rather than a list.

To fix this bug, the `_convert_key` method should first check if the `key` parameter is a list or a single value. If it's a single value, the method should convert it to a list before processing. Additionally, it should handle both integer and non-integer index cases properly, as per the error message.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index (so we don't fallback).
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return [key]  # Convert to list if is_setter is True and key is not a list
    
    if not isinstance(key, list):
        key = [key]  # If key is not a list, convert it to a list

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At-based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At-based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

By handling the `key` parameter as described above, the bug in the `_convert_key` method should be fixed. This should enable proper handling of different types of indexers when using `ser.at[]` and resolve the error encountered in the test cases.
