Please fix the function/method provided below and provide the corrected function/method as the output.


# Buggy function source code
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/pandas_69/pandas/core/indexing.py

# this is the buggy function you need to fix

    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)
