Potential error location: The potential error in the code lies in the if condition checks for integer index and non-integer index.

Reason for the bug: The bug occurs because the conditions in the if statements are incorrect and do not properly handle the checks for integer and non-integer indexes.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the index is an instance of an integer type.
2. Check if the index is an instance of a non-integer type.

Corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

In the corrected code, we use the `isinstance` method to check if the index is of type `pd.Int64Index` and if the indexer is of type `int`. This will properly handle the checks for integer and non-integer indexes and raise a ValueError if the conditions are not met.
