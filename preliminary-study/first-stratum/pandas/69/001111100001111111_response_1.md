Potential error location: The bug seems to be occurring in the "_convert_key" function. It is failing to correctly handle the different types of indexes, such as datetime64[ns] and timedelta64[ns].

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The function is not properly handling different types of indexes and their corresponding integer/floating values.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the type of the index and handle integer/floating values accordingly.
2. Update the function to handle both datetime64[ns] and timedelta64[ns] indexes separately.
3. Use isinstance() to determine the type of index and then handle the values based on the index type.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function "_convert_key":

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
        
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex):
                if not np.issubdtype(type(i), np.integer):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a datetime index can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            elif isinstance(ax, pd.TimedeltaIndex):
                if not np.issubdtype(type(i), np.floating):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a timedelta index can only have floating-point indexers"
                    )
            else:
                raise ValueError("Unsupported index type")
        return key
```
