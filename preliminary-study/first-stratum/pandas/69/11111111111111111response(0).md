The error occurs in the `_convert_key` method of the `_AtIndexer` class in the `pandas/core/indexing.py` file. This method is responsible for converting the key based on the index type.

The error occurs because the code incorrectly checks if the key should be an integer or a floating-point number. The correct approach should be to only allow integer keys for integer indexes and float keys for non-integer indexes. This is important to ensure that the key matches the type of the index.

To fix the bug, the `_convert_key` method should be modified to properly handle integer and non-integer indexes and their corresponding key types. It should involve checking the type of the index and converting the key accordingly to match the index type.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index (so we don't fallback).
    """

    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) or not is_float(i):  # Check if the key is not a float
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This updated code checks for both integer and non-integer indexes and ensures that the key type aligns with the index type, preventing the occurrence of the previous bug.
