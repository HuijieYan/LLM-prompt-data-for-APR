The error is occurring in the `_convert_key` method. The method is checking if the index type matches the input type, and if not, it is raising a ValueError. However, the logic for checking the input type against the index type seems to be incorrect.

The bug seems to be related to the comparison of the input key type with the index type. The method is using the `is_integer()` and `holds_integer()` methods to check the type of the index, but it is not correctly handling the non-integer index case.

To fix the bug, we should modify the logic for checking the input key type against the index type. We should also handle the cases when the index type is not of integer type.

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # corrected function
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex):
                if not isinstance(i, pd.Timestamp):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on datetime index can only have datetime indexers"
                    )
            elif isinstance(ax, pd.TimedeltaIndex):
                if not isinstance(i, pd.Timedelta):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on timedelta index can only have timedelta indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if not isinstance(i, (int, np.int64)):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

With this corrected code, we are checking the type of the index (`ax`) and the input key (`i`) separately for each case (datetime, timedelta, and integer). This ensures that the comparison between the index and input key is handled correctly for each scenario.
