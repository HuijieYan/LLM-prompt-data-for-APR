Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the function is the usage of the 'is_integer()' and 'holds_integer()' methods. These methods are not commonly used and might not be providing the functionality expected by the developer.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the 'is_integer()' and 'holds_integer()' methods are not standard methods in Python. It seems like these methods were custom methods added by the developer, but they are not functioning as intended.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we can replace the usage of 'is_integer()' and 'holds_integer()' methods with standard Python methods for checking the integer type, such as 'isinstance(i, int)'. This will ensure that the code checks for integer types in a standard and accurate way.

Corrected Code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/pandas_69/pandas/core/indexing.py

def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(i, int):
            if not isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not isinstance(i, int) and isinstance(ax, (pd.RangeIndex, pd.Float64Index)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
In the corrected code, the 'is_integer()' and 'holds_integer()' methods have been replaced with 'isinstance(i, int)' to check for integer types, and 'isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index)' and isinstance(ax, (pd.RangeIndex, pd.Float64Index)) to check for specific index types.
