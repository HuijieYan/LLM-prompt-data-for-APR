The error occurs in the `_convert_key` function. The function is not handling non-integer indexes correctly while performing a look-up operation. When the look-up key is non-integer, it raises a ValueError.

To solve this issue, the key comparison should be revised. The function should correctly check whether the key is an integer and whether the index holds integers.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)
    
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                    "can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

By using the `isinstance` function, we can accurately check whether the key is an integer. This will prevent the ValueError from being raised unnecessarily.
