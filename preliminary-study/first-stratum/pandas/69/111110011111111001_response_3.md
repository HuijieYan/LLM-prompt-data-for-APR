The bug occurs in the `_convert_key` method of the `_AtIndexer` class. In the error message, the code is trying to access an element by key `4` using the `.at` attribute of a series. This triggers the `_convert_key` method, which is intended to require keys to be the same type as the index.

The bug occurs because the original code does not handle the cases where the key is a float and the index is an integer (or vice versa) correctly. The function incorrectly raises a `ValueError` in these cases.

To fix the bug, the method should be modified to handle the cases where the key and the index are of different types. It should check if the key and index types are compatible and convert them if necessary.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index.
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int) and not (isinstance(i, float) and i.is_integer()):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not (isinstance(i, float) and not i.is_integer()):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code checks if the key and index types are compatible and raises a `ValueError` only if they are not compatible, handling both integer and float cases.
