The buggy function `_convert_key` is designed to check the type of keys against the type of the index. The function accepts two arguments: `key` and `is_setter`, and performs type validation on the `key` based on the types of the index.

The bug occurs because the function incorrectly compares the type of the key with the type of the index. It also checks for integer values in the keys even if the index type is not integer.

To fix the bug, we should modify the type checking logic and handle non-integer index types correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex) and not isinstance(i, pd.Timestamp):
            raise ValueError("At based indexing on a datetime index can only have datetime indexers")
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.TimedeltaIndex) and not isinstance(i, pd.Timedelta):
            raise ValueError("At based indexing on a timedelta index can only have timedelta indexers")
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.NumericIndex) and not np.issubdtype(type(i), np.number):
            raise ValueError("At based indexing on a numeric index can only have numeric indexers")

    return key
```

In this corrected code, we use the `isinstance` function to check if `ax` is a specific type of index and compare the type of `i` accordingly. This approach allows us to handle different index types and their corresponding key types correctly.
