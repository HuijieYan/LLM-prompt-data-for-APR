The bug occurs in the `_convert_key` method of the `_AtIndexer` class. This method is used to convert the key before performing an index-based operation. The bug arises from the validation logic within the method, where it checks if the key is an integer based on the index type.

The problem occurs because the current implementation does not account for non-integer keys when dealing with non-integer indexes, and vice versa. This leads to a mismatch and raises a `ValueError`.

To fix the bug, the validation logic needs to be adjusted to properly handle both integer and non-integer keys based on the index type.

Here's the corrected version of the `_convert_key` method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_type('int'):
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError("Indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers")
        else:
            if not isinstance(i, (float, np.float64)):
                raise ValueError("Indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers")
    return key
```

In this corrected version, the `is_type` function is used to check the type of the index, and the isinstance function is used to validate the type of the key based on the index type. This approach ensures that the key and index types are compatible and handles integer and non-integer keys appropriately.
