The issue is occurring in the `_convert_key` method, specifically in the loop where it checks if the index's axes are of integer type and then compares it with the key values. The issue is present in the validation condition for non-integer indexes, which should allow the integer values.

The bug is happening because the key is being compared with the `ax.holds_integer()` method, which is not correct. The `holds_integer` method does not represent whether the index holds an integer value. Instead, it checks if the index can efficiently store integers. Since it's misleading, the condition is throwing a ValueError exception.

To fix this bug, the condition checking if the index holds an integer should be replaced. Instead, it should check if the key value is non-integer when the related axis holds non-integer values.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) or not np.issubdtype(type(i), np.integer):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )

    return key
```

By using the `np.issubdtype` method, we can correctly verify if the key value is a non-integer and handle the scenario accurately.

This corrected code should resolve the ValueError exception occurring in the identified test scenarios.
