The buggy function `_convert_key` has an issue with the conditional checks. It should check if the index holds integers and if the indexer is an integer, but the current logic is checking the opposite. This results in the wrong error message being raised.

To fix this bug, the condition checks need to be reversed so that they check if the index holds integers and if the indexer is an integer. Additionally, the function should return a list if `is_setter` is true.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)
    
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_floating() and not is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                "can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
        elif ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```

This revised function correctly checks if the index holds integers and then compares the type of the indexer to determine if an error should be raised.
