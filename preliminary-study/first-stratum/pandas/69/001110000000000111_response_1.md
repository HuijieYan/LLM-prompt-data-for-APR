The buggy function `_convert_key` is used to convert index keys, and the bug is likely related to the logic used for handling integer and non-integer indexes.

The error messages suggest that there might be issues with how integer and non-integer indexes are handled in the function.

The potential error location within the function is the logic that checks whether the index is integer or non-integer.

The bug likely occurs because the logic for checking integer and non-integer indexes is not correctly implemented. There may be incorrect condition checks or comparisons that lead to inappropriate error messages or behavior.

To fix the bug, the logic for checking integer and non-integer indexes should be reviewed. The conditions and comparisons should be corrected to accurately handle the different types of indexes.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

In the corrected code, the `is_integer()` method is replaced with `isinstance(i, int)` for checking whether the index is an integer. This change ensures that the correct type comparison is used. Additionally, the condition for checking non-integer indexes is also adjusted to use `isinstance(i, int)` properly.
