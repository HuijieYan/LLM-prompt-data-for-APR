Sure, here's the full code of the fixed function:

```python
import pandas as pd

class _AtIndexer:
    def __init__(self, obj):
        self.obj = obj

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        if not is_setter:
            for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
                if i != int(i):
                    raise ValueError("Indexing can only have integer indexers")
                if not isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
                    raise ValueError("Indexing can only have Float64Index")
        return key
```

In this code, the `_convert_key` method has been included in the `_AtIndexer` class. The method now correctly handles the cases of integer and non-integer indexers, and also checks if the axis is a `Float64Index`. If any of these conditions are not met, a `ValueError` is raised.

This should resolve the bug and ensure the correct handling of different types of indexers.
