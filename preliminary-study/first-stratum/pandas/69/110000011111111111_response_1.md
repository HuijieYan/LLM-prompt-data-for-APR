The error occurs in the `_convert_key` function where it checks if the index is integer, and if the indexer is also integer. The bug is likely due to the combination of integer index and non-integer indexer (e.g., index=Float64Index and indexer=integer or index=TimedeltaIndex and indexer=float). This leads to the ValueError being raised.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for checking integer and non-integer indexers. We should only check for integer indexers if the index is of integer type, and similarly, for non-integer indexers.

Here's the corrected `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """

    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and isinstance(i, int):
            continue
        elif ax.is_integer() and not isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not ax.holds_integer() and not isinstance(i, float):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                "index can only have non-integer "
                "indexers"
            )
    return key
```

This updated code checks the type of the indexer based on the type of the index, and raises a ValueError if it's not of the expected type. This will ensure that the correct type of indexer is used for the specific type of index.
