The test cases are testing the behavior of different operations related to indexing, particularly focusing on the behavior while using the 'at' accessor.

The error message indicates that there is an issue with non-integer indexers in the 'at' based indexing. The error occurs in the '_convert_key' method of the '_AtIndexer' class in the 'pandas/core/indexing.py' file.

The error occurs because the code doesn't handle non-integer indexers correctly when using the 'at' based indexing. This results in a ValueError being raised when non-integer indexers are encountered.

To fix the bug, the code should be modified to handle non-integer indexers correctly when using the 'at' based indexing.

Here's the corrected code for the '_convert_key' method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for i, ax in enumerate(self.obj.axes):
        if isinstance(ax, ABCIndex):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not is_integer(key[i]):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if is_integer(key[i]) and not ax.holds_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
    return key
```
