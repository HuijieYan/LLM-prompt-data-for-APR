Based on the error message and the test case provided, the issue seems to occur in the `_convert_key` method of the `_AtIndexer` class in the `pandas/core/indexing.py` file. 

The error message indicates that when accessing an index with `.at[4]`, it raises a ValueError. The code is trying to check whether the given index is an integer or not, based on the type of the index and the value of the key. 

The issue may be occurring because there is no check for whether the series being accessed is actually a datetime or timedelta index and then handling the key accordingly.

To fix this issue, it would be better to directly handle the datetime or timedelta index cases separately within the `_convert_key` method. This can be achieved by checking the type of the index and handling the comparison logic accordingly.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):

    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    if isinstance(self.obj, pd.DatetimeIndex) or isinstance(self.obj, pd.TimedeltaIndex):
        key = pd.Timestamp(key).to_datetime64()
        return key
    else:
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
    return key
```

With this corrected code, the `_convert_key` method first checks if the index is a datetime or timedelta index. If it is, it converts the key to a `Timestamp` and then converts it to `datetime64`. If the index is not a datetime or timedelta index, it proceeds with the original logic of checking integer and non-integer indices.
