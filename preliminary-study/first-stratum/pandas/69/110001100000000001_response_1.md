Potential error location: The error may occur in the for loop where the function is checking the type of the index and key values.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: 
1. The function is not properly checking the type of the index and key values, leading to errors with integer and non-integer indexes.
2. The logic for checking whether the index is an integer or holds an integer is not implemented correctly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use isinstance() to check the type of the index and key values.
2. Implement separate logic for integer and non-integer index cases to correctly handle the type of indexers.

Corrected code:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index) or isinstance(ax, pd.UInt64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not (isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index) or isinstance(ax, pd.StringIndex)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
