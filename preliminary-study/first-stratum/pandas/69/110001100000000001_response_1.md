Potential Error Location: The error seems to occur in the loop that iterates through the object axes and checks the type of each index value.

Reason for the Bug: The bug occurs because the function is trying to compare the type of the index value with the type of the axis, but there are several issues with the logic and syntax of the comparisons.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug: We need to modify the logic of the loop to correctly check the type of the index value against the type of the axis. Additionally, we should use the `isinstance()` function to check the type of the index value.

Corrected Code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """

    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.is_integer():
            raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
        elif not isinstance(i, int) and ax.is_integer():
            raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

In the corrected code, we use the `isinstance()` function to check if the index value is an integer and then compare it with the axis type. We also corrected the error messages to reflect the correct type comparisons.
