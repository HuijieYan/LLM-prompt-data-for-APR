The bug in the provided code is that the function `_convert_key` does not have `self` as the first parameter. This function is inside a class, so it should have `self` as the first parameter.

Additionally, there are issues with the condition checks inside the function, and it is not clear what the intended functionality of the function is.

To fix the bug, the `_convert_key` method needs to have `self` as the first parameter. The condition checks and the logic inside the method also need to be reviewed and the intention of the method must be understood to make the necessary corrections. Without a clear definition of the purpose of the method, it's difficult to provide a specific fix.

Here is the corrected code with `self` added as the first parameter:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # add self as the first parameter
    
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
Please note that the logic and condition checks inside the function may need to be reviewed and adjusted based on the actual intended functionality of the method.
