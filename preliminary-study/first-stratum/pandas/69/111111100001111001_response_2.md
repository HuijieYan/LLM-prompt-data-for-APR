The buggy function `_convert_key` has a few issues. It is intended to enforce certain conditions on the input `key` based on the properties of the index, but it contains some logical errors. 

The function iterates over the axes of `self.obj` and attempts to compare the elements of `key` with the properties of each axis. However, it tries to invoke methods like `is_integer` and `holds_integer` directly on `ax`, which represents an axis in the loop. This approach is logically incorrect and will lead to errors.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to separately check the properties of the index and validate the `key` based on those properties. Additionally, the function should include guard clauses to handle cases where the types of `key` and the index types are not compatible.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    idx_type = type(self.obj.index)
    if not isinstance(key, idx_type):
        raise TypeError("Key type must match the type of the index")

    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    if isinstance(idx_type, pd.DatetimeIndex):
        if not isinstance(key, pd.DatetimeIndex):
            raise ValueError("At based indexing on a datetime index can only have datetime indexers")
    elif isinstance(idx_type, pd.TimedeltaIndex):
        if not isinstance(key, pd.TimedeltaIndex):
            raise ValueError("At based indexing on a timedelta index can only have timedelta indexers")
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Unsupported index type: {idx_type}")

    return key
```

In this corrected function, it first checks whether the type of `key` matches the type of the index. Then, based on the type of the index, it performs specific checks to ensure that the type of `key` matches the index type, raising appropriate errors when violations are detected.
