1. The test case is testing the behavior of the `get_value` method for a `Float64Index`. The test is designed to check if the method returns the expected result for specific input values.

2. The error occurs in the `_convert_key` method of the `_AtIndexer` class. The method raises a `ValueError` when it encounters a non-integer index while performing an integer-based indexing. This behavior is not aligned with the expected functionality.

3. The bug occurs because the `_convert_key` method is incorrectly validating the type of index and raising a `ValueError` when it encounters a non-integer index for integer-based indexing. This prevents the `get_value` method from functioning correctly when dealing with non-integer indexes.

4. To fix the bug, one approach is to modify the `_convert_key` method to accept non-integer indexes for integer-based indexing. This will allow the `get_value` method to handle non-integer indexes correctly.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # the corrected _convert_key method
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

The correction involves removing the check for non-integer indexes in the `_convert_key` method. This change allows the method to accept non-integer indexes for integer-based indexing, aligning the behavior with the expected functionality in the test cases.
