The code is raising a ValueError when the condition `is_setter` is False, ax.is_integer() is False, and is_integer(i) is True. This indicates that the issue lies within the `for` loop block and is likely due to incorrect comparison of types.

The bug occurs because the condition to handle non-integer indexers is incorrect. When iterating through the axes, the code is incorrectly checking if `is_integer(i)` is True while also checking if `ax.is_integer()` is False, leading to the ValueError.

To fix the bug, the condition checking for non-integer indexers should be modified. It should check whether `ax.is_floating()` is True, and if so, verify if `not is_integer(i)` is also True.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """

    
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if ax.is_floating() and not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
