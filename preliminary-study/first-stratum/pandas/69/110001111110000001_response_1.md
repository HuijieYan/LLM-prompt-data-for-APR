The error message indicates that there is a ValueError being raised in the `_convert_key` function of the `indexing.py` due to non-integer indexing on a non-integer index. This error occurs when using `ser.at[4]` in the test function.

The reason behind the bug is that the function is not handling non-integer indexes and non-integer indexers correctly, leading to the ValueError being raised.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function to handle non-integer indexes and non-integer indexers appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """

    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        # Check if the index is integer or not
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            # Check if the index is non-integer and handle non-integer indexers
            if pd.api.types.is_integer(i) and not pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype(ax):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this updated code, the `_convert_key` function should now properly handle non-integer indexes and non-integer indexers, resolving the ValueError that was occurring in the test function.
