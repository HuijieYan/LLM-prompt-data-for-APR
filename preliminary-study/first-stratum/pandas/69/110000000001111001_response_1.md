Potential error location: 
The error might be occurring between the comparison of the key values and the index values due to type mismatch.

Reason for the bug:
The bug seems to be occurring because the function is not handling the comparison between the key values and the index values properly, leading to errors when the types do not match.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
1. Validate the type of the index and key before the comparison.
2. If the index is an integer, ensure that the key is also an integer, and vice versa for non-integer indexes.
3. Handle the comparison based on the type of the index and key appropriately.

# Corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, (int, float)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.TimedeltaIndex):
            if not isinstance(i, (int, float)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
In the corrected code, the function checks the type of the index and key before performing the comparison. If the index is a Float64Index, it ensures that the key is either an int or a float. If the index is a TimedeltaIndex, it ensures that the key is also an int or a float. This approach ensures that the types are compatible before performing the comparison, preventing the errors that occurred previously.
