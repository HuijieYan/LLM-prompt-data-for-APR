Potential error location: 
The error seems to be occurring in the for loop where the function is iterating through the axes and checking if the index is an integer.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. The function is not handling the case where the key is not iterable when is_setter is false.
2. The function is not properly checking if the index is an integer for all axes.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add a condition to check if the key is not iterable when is_setter is false and return key as it is.
2. Include checks to ensure that the key is of the same length as the axes when is_setter is false.

Corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    if not hasattr(key, '__iter__'):
        return key

    if len(key) != len(self.obj.axes):
        raise ValueError("All axes must be included in the key")

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
