The error occurs in the `_convert_key` method. Specifically, the issue is with the validation of the key being used for indexing. The method is currently checking if the index is integer-based and if the key used for indexing is an integer. If the index is non-integer-based, it checks if the key used for indexing is a non-integer. 

The error message indicates that the validation is failing when performing "at" based indexing on a non-integer index, and it suggests that the check for non-integer key indexers is causing the issue.

To fix the bug, the validation logic needs to be adjusted. The correct approach would be to check if the index is integer-based and then ensure that the key indexer is an integer. If the index is non-integer-based, then the key should be of the same type as the index (e.g., non-integer) to avoid the ValueError.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be of the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if ax.is_numeric() and not is_numeric(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                    "can only have non-integer indexers"
                )

    return key
```
