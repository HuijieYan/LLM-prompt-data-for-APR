The issue seems to stem from the `_try_convert_to_date` method inside the Parser class. The method is attempting to convert data into a date column and is expected to return a boolean if parsing was successful. However, it is currently encountering errors and not returning the expected output in certain cases.

The bug occurs due to incorrect data type handling and the absence of proper error handling in the method. When the input data is of the RangeIndex type, the method attempts to coerce it into the int64 type, but it fails to handle the conversion correctly. Similarly, when the input data is of the bool type, the method encounters errors and does not handle them appropriately.

To fix the bug, the method should include proper error handling for the data type conversions and datetime parsing. Additionally, a proper conditional check and return statement should be added to ensure that the method returns the expected output in all cases.

Here's the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` method:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import to_datetime, isna, iNaT

class Parser():
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray-like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """

        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
                return new_data, True
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue

        return data, False
```

With these changes, the `_try_convert_to_date` method should now handle the input data correctly and return the expected output in all cases.
