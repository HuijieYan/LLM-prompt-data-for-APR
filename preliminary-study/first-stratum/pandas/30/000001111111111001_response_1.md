The problem occurs in the `_try_convert_to_date` function. The function is trying to convert boolean values to datetime objects, which is causing a TypeError. This is happening because the function is attempting to convert all data types to dates, including boolean values.

To fix this issue, we need to check the data type of the input before attempting to convert it to a datetime object. If the data is not of type `object`, we should return the data as is. However, if the data is of type `object`, we should only attempt to convert it to `int64` if it is convertible, and if not, we should return the data as is.

Here's the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
            date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
            for date_unit in date_units:
                try:
                    new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
                except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                    continue
            return new_data, True
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    return data, False
```

This code checks if the data type is equal to "object" and attempts to convert it to `int64` only if it is convertible. Then it tries to convert to datetime object only if the data is successfully converted to `int64` without any errors. Finally, it returns the converted data with a flag indicating the success of the conversion, or it returns the original data if no conversion took place.
