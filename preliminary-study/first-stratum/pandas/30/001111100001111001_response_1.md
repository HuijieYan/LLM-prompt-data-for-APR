The code provided checks whether a given input data can be converted to a date. There are several issues in the code that need to be addressed:

1. The condition `if not len(data)` checks if the data is empty. Instead, it should check if `data` is `None`, or if `data` is an empty array.

2. The line `new_data = data` just reassigns the `data` object to `new_data`. It should create a copy of the `data` instead, to avoid modifying the original `data` object.

3. The line `if new_data.dtype == "object":` tries to check the data type of the array. However, it's missing the import for `np` which is likely `numpy` and it also should be `str` instead of "object".

4. The use of `isna()`, `iNaT`, and `to_datetime` indicates that there is a dependency on other modules (e.g., numpy, pandas). These dependencies should be properly imported at the top of the file (`import numpy as np`, `import pandas as pd`) to resolve these references.

5. It's not clear how `self.date_unit` is defined. We need to ensure that it's properly passed to the class and its type/expected value are correct.

Given these issues, the corrected function is provided below:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

class Parser():
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):

        if data is None or len(data) == 0:
            return data, False

        new_data = data.copy()
        if new_data.dtype == np.dtype('object'):
            try:
                new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                pd.isna(new_data)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data == np.iinfo(np.int64).max)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

This corrected function addresses the issues mentioned and provides a more robust implementation for converting data to dates.
