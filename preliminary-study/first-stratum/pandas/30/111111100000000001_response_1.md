Potential error location: It seems like the error could be occurring in the condition `if not len(data):` as it is checking the length of the entire data array, not individual elements.

Reasons for the bug: The function is not handling individual elements of the data array appropriately, and is not considering the possibility of individual elements being in a different format.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the length of individual elements in the data array, rather than the length of the entire array.
2. Handle individual elements of the data array based on their data type, and convert them to datetime accordingly.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, to_datetime
from pandas._libs.tslibs.nattype import NaT as iNaT

class Parser():
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
        
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
