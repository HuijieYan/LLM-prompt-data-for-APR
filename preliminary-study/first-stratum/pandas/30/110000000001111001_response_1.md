The code is attempting to convert the data into a date column by parsing data in different formats. There are several issues with the code that need to be addressed to fix the buggy function.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the handling of the new_data variable, particularly in the conversion and type checking.

The bug occurs because the code attempts to convert 'object' dtype to 'int64', but fails to check for the correct dtype.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to properly handle the dtype conversion and type checking for the new_data variable. Additionally, it's important to ensure that the correct dtype comparison is performed and the try-except blocks are updated to handle the exceptions properly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """

    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_numeric(new_data, errors="raise")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            pd.isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True

    return data, False
```

In the corrected code, the issues with dtype checking and conversion have been addressed. The code now correctly handles dtype conversion and type checking for the new_data variable. Additionally, the try-except blocks have been updated to handle the exceptions properly.
