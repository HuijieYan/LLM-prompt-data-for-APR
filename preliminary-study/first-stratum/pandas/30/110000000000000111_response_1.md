The issue here seems to be related to the `pd.read_json` function when `typ="series"` is used. The expected output is a Pandas Series of booleans, but instead, it's resulting in a Series of timestamps or raising a TypeError in newer versions of Pandas.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `_try_convert_to_date` method. It seems to be incorrectly trying to convert bool values into datetime objects, resulting in the unexpected behavior.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `_try_convert_to_date` method is not handling bool values correctly and is instead trying to parse them as dates, leading to the unexpected output or TypeError.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the `_try_convert_to_date` method to handle bool values separately and return a Pandas Series of booleans as expected.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    elif new_data.dtype == "bool":
        # If the dtype is bool, return the data as is
        return data, True

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected `_try_convert_to_date` method now handles bool values separately and returns the data as is, along with a boolean indicating the parsing success. This should resolve the issue with `pd.read_json` returning unexpected outputs or raising a TypeError when `typ="series"`.
