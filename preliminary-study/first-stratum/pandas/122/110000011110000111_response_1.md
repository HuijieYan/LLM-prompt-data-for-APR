The test case is trying to check whether two dataframes `df1` and `df2` are equal using the `equals` method. However, the test is failing with an assertion error because `df1.equals(df2)` is returning `True` instead of `False`, which is the expected output.

The potential error in the function lies in the comparison of the blocks within the dataframes. It seems that the comparison of the blocks is not considering their order or type, leading to incorrect results.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is the incorrect comparison of blocks within the dataframes. The function does not properly consolidate and compare the blocks to determine the equality of the dataframes. Additionally, the canonicalization process based on block type and locations is not adequately implemented.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic should be modified to properly consider the type and order of the blocks within the dataframes.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())  # Updated to consider block type

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By considering the type of the block along with its locations for canonicalization, the comparison will be more accurate, and the bug should be fixed.
