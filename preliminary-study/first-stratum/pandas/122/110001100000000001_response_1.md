Potential Error Location: The problematic function is the `equals` method, which is comparing the equality of two objects based on their axes and blocks.

Reason for the Bug: The bug may occur due to the incomplete implementation of the `equals` method. The method does not consolidate the internal data structures before comparing, which may lead to incorrect results.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug: To fix the bug, the `equals` method should ensure that both `self` and `other` objects are consolidated before comparing their axes and blocks.

Corrected Code:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
