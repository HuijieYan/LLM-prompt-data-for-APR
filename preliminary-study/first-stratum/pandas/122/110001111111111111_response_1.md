The test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` is checking whether `df1` equals `df2` by using the `equals` method. The expected outcome is `False` since the dataframes have different values in their columns.

The potential error location within the `equals` method is the sorting of the dataframe blocks using the `canonicalize` function. This function is supposed to generate a tuple based on the block's datatype and location, but it seems the usage within the `equals` method is not correct.

The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function is used in a way that it may not correctly differentiate between blocks that have the same data type and different locations.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be modified to accurately distinguish between blocks with the same data type but different locations.

Here's the corrected `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtypes, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `canonicalize` function generates a tuple based on the data type of the block and its locations. This will ensure that blocks with the same data type but different locations are correctly distinguished, addressing the bug in the `equals` method.
