The `equals` function is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects and return True if they are equal. However, the current implementation has a bug that causes it to return True for identical blocks with different locations.

The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle the comparison of blocks with the same data but different locations. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort blocks based on their type and location, but it does not take into account the actual data within the blocks.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic needs to be updated to properly handle cases where the block data is the same but their locations are different.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare each block individually
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

With this corrected implementation, the `equals` function should now properly compare the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects and return True only if they are identical in terms of both data and location.
