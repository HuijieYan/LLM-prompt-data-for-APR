The test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` is checking whether `df1.equals(df2)` returns `False`, as expected. However, the test fails with the error message `assert True is False`, indicating that `df1.equals(df2)` is erroneously returning `True`.

The potential error location within the `equals` function is likely the comparison of blocks using the `canonicalize` function. It seems that this comparison may not handle the case where identical blocks have different locations, leading to an incorrect result when comparing the DataFrames.

The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function is used to order and compare the blocks. However, this function fails to take into account the possibility of identical blocks having different locations, resulting in the comparison incorrectly identifying them as unequal.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should take block locations into account when ordering the blocks for comparison. This modification will ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as equal.

The corrected code for the `equals` function is provided below:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())  # Modify canonicalize to include block locations
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected code, the `canonicalize` function now includes the block locations when ordering the blocks. This ensures that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as equal, addressing the bug where `df1.equals(df2)` erroneously returned `True`.
