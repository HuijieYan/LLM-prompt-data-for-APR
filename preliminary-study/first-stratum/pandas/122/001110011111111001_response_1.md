The test_dataframe_not_equal function is trying to verify that df1 does not equal df2. However, the test assertion fails because it is comparing True with False. This indicates that the equals function is returning True when it should return False.

The potential error in the equals method could be related to the way it compares the blocks within the DataFrames. It seems that the comparison logic is not working as expected.

The bug is occurring because the canonicalization of the blocks is not being performed correctly in the equals function. This is leading to incorrect comparisons of the blocks within the DataFrames.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to ensure that the blocks are properly canonized in both DataFrames before the comparison. This can be done by using a consistent method to order and compare the blocks.

Here's the corrected code for the equals method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order using a consistent method
    def canonicalize(blocks):
        return sorted(blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtypes.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    self_blocks = canonicalize(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = canonicalize(other.blocks)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code ensures that the blocks within the DataFrames are properly ordered and compared, which should fix the bug and make the test_dataframe_not_equal function pass.
