The potential error location in the given function is the `equals` method. It seems like this function is trying to compare two objects of the same type for equality. However, the implementation is flawed, and it seems to be related to the comparison of axes and blocks within the objects.

The reason for the bug could be that the comparison of `axes` and `blocks` is not being done correctly, leading to false negatives when comparing two objects for equality.

One possible approach to fixing this bug would be to ensure that the `equals` method for the `ax1` and `ax2` objects is implemented correctly. Additionally, the comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` should be verified to ensure that the equality comparison is accurate.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if len(self.axes) != len(other.axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self.axes, other.axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `axes` and `blocks` are directly compared, and the `equals` method is used to compare the individual elements within the axes and blocks. Additionally, the `_consolidate_inplace` method is called for both `self` and `other` objects before comparing the blocks.
