The bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class is that the method is trying to call `canonicalize` function, which is defined outside of the class, but it should actually be calling the `canonicalize` method that is defined within the class.

To fix this bug, we need to replace the call to the external `canonicalize` function with a call to the `canonicalize` method of the `BlockManager` class.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
# this is the corrected code for the equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # corrected call to the canonicalize method within the class
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
