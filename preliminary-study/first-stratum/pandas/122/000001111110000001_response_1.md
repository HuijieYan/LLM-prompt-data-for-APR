The error message is showing that the `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` statement is failing, indicating that the `equals` function is not working as expected. 

The potential error location is within the `equals` function provided. The `canonicalize` function is being defined twice within the `equals` function, which is unnecessary.

The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function is being defined twice within the `equals` function. This can lead to confusion and potential bugs as both functions have the same name.

To fix the bug, the duplicated `canonicalize` function definition should be removed from the `equals` function. Additionally, it is recommended to add import statements for the necessary libraries, e.g., `pandas` in the `as_array` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Additionally, it's important to ensure that the necessary import statements for pandas are included in the file where the function is used.
