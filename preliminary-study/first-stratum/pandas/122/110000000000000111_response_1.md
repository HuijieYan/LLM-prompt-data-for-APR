Analysis:
The test case creates two DataFrames with the same data but in a different order. When calling the equals() method, it is expected to return False because the dataframes have different column order.

Error Location:
The potential error location within the function is in the sorting of blocks using the canonicalize function. This function sorts the blocks based on the type name and mgr_locs, but it does not take into account the original order of the columns in the DataFrame.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug occurs because the sorting of blocks using the canonicalize function does not consider the original order of the columns in the DataFrame. As a result, identifying identical blocks with different locations becomes challenging.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
One possible approach to fix the bug is to modify the canonicalize function to consider the original order of the columns in the DataFrame. This can be achieved by incorporating the column names along with the type name and mgr_locs when sorting the blocks.

Corrected Code:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs and column names
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), list(block.columns))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
