Potential error location: The `equals` function is comparing two dataframes and returning `True` even when the blocks are identical but have different locations.

Reason behind the bug: The bug occurs because the `equals` function does not account for the possibility of identical blocks with different locations. The function only compares the axes and then the blocks without considering the block locations.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the comparison logic to account for the possibility of identical blocks with different locations.
2. Implement a mechanism to consider the block locations when comparing the dataframes.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Consolidate the dataframes inplace
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    # Check if the consolidated blocks are equal
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    for b1, b2 in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not b1.equals(b2):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected code addresses the bug by first consolidating the dataframes inplace before comparing the blocks. It ensures that identical blocks with different locations are properly accounted for when determining equality between the dataframes.
