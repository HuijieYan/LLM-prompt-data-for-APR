Potential error location: The error may be in the `equals` method for comparing two objects.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: 
1. The method is not considering the case when `other` is not of the same type as `self`.
2. The `equals` method is comparing the blocks without consolidating them, which can lead to false negatives in the comparison.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
1. Check if `other` is an instance of the same class as `self` before comparing.
2. Consolidate the blocks before comparing them to ensure accurate comparison.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, type(self)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
