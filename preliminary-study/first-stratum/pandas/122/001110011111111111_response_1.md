The error occurs when using the `equals` method of a DataFrame to compare two DataFrames `df1` and `df2`. The expected result is `False` since the values in the DataFrames are not the same, but the function incorrectly returns `True`.

Looking at the code, the issue seems to be within the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. It compares the axes and blocks of the two DataFrames but does not take into account the values themselves.

The bug occurs because the `equals` method only compares the axes and blocks of the DataFrames, and it does not consider the actual values of the DataFrames. This results in cases where two DataFrames with different values could still be considered equal if their axes and blocks are the same.

To fix this bug, the `equals` method should compare the values of the DataFrames along with their axes and blocks.

Here's the corrected `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self_values = self.values
    other_values = other.values
    
    if self_values.shape != other_values.shape or not np.array_equal(self_values, other_values):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected `equals` method now compares the values of the DataFrames in addition to comparing the axes and blocks. This should resolve the issue and return the correct result when comparing two DataFrames.
