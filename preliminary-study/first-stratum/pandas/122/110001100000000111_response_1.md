Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the `equals` function in the `pandas_122/pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. The function is not correctly comparing the content of the DataFrame and erroneously returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The issue arises because the function does not properly handle the comparison of identical blocks with different locations.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Create a function to compare blocks based on their values, rather than their locations.
2. Sort the blocks before comparison to ensure consistent ordering.
3. Use a robust method to distinguish between unconsolidated blocks, such as employing the type name and manager locations.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
  
    # Create a function to compare blocks based on their values
    def compare_blocks(block):
        return block.values
  
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=compare_blocks)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=compare_blocks)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
