Potential Error Location: The buggy function 'equals' compares the properties and values of two objects 'self' and 'other'. However, it seems to refer to the 'canonicalize' function twice, which can cause confusion and potential errors.

Reasons behind the Bug:
1. The 'canonicalize' function is declared twice, which can lead to ambiguity and potential errors.
2. The function does not handle potential errors or exceptions.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Remove the duplicate declaration of the 'canonicalize' function.
2. Add exception handling to address potential errors during comparison.

Corrected Code:

def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
