The bug in the given equals method is due to the comparison between self.blocks and other.blocks and the way they are sorted. It seems like the bug is due to the wrong handling of the comparison and consolidation of the blocks.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that we are comparing the blocks and their order correctly, and that consolidation is done in the right order.

Here's the fixed code for the equals method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if len(self.axes) != len(other.axes):
        return False
    
    for i in range(len(self.axes)):
        if not self.axes[i].equals(other.axes[i]):
            return False
        
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = [tuple(sorted(block.items) for block in self.blocks)]
    other_blocks = [tuple(sorted(block.items) for block in other.blocks)]
    
    return self_blocks == other_blocks
```

In this fixed code, we compare the axes between self and other to ensure that they are the same. Then, we consolidate them in place and compare the blocks after sorting them. By comparing the sorted blocks, we're ensuring that the comparison is not affected by the order. Finally, we return the result of the comparison.
