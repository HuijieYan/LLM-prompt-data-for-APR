The test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames, `df1` and `df2`, with different values in the columns. It then checks if `df1` is equal to `df2` using the `equals` method, expecting it to return `False`. However, the assert statement fails with the error message `E       assert True is False`.

The potential error location within the `equals` method is the comparison of the data blocks of `self` and `other`. The current implementation attempts to sort the data blocks and compares them based on their data type and manager locations, but this process is not functioning correctly.

The bug occurs because the current implementation of the `equals` method does not handle the case where the data frames have different values in their columns. It only concerns itself with the block structure and data type of the blocks.

To fix the bug, the `equals` method needs to compare the actual values within the blocks of `self` and `other` instead of just sorting and comparing the blocks based on data type and manager locations.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare blocks by their actual values
    for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected code compares the blocks based on their actual values, ensuring that it correctly determines if the DataFrames are equal.
