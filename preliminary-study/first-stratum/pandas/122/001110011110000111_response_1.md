1. The test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` is comparing two dataframes `df1` and `df2` using the `equals` method. The expected outcome is `False` because the two dataframes are not equal.

2. The potential error location within the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class is the comparison of blocks using the `equals` method. The issue may arise from the sorting and comparison of blocks.

3. The bug occurs because the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class is not correctly comparing the blocks in the dataframes. It is sorting the blocks using a custom `canonicalize` function and then comparing them. However, the sorting and comparison logic has a bug that leads to incorrect outcomes.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the sorting and comparison logic for the blocks is correct. This may involve modifying the `canonicalize` function or the sorting comparison process.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())  # corrected as_array method call

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected code includes a fix for the `as_array` method call, and the sorting and comparison process for the blocks is adjusted to ensure that correct outcomes are obtained.
