Potential Error Location:
The buggy function "equals" within the "BlockManager" class.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug occurs because the equals function in the BlockManager class is not properly comparing two DataFrames. The bug might be related to the comparison of the DataFrame axes, blocks, and the consolidation that is not handled correctly.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the comparison of axes is performed accurately to check for equality.
2. Properly consolidate the data before comparing the blocks to ensure a fair comparison.
3. Use suitable comparison and sorting methods to compare and sort the blocks and their contents.
4. Ensure that the comparison is done at the right level of granularity to avoid any discrepancies.

Corrected Code:
```python
# this is the corrected equals function
def equals(self, other):
    if not self.axes.equals(other.axes):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
With this corrected code, the equals function now properly compares the axes and the blocks of the two DataFrames to determine equality.
