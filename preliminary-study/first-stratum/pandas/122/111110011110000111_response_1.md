1. The test case uses the `equals` method to compare two DataFrames `df1` and `df2`. The expected result is `False` since the two dataframes have different values, but the actual result is `True`, leading to the assertion error.

2. The potential error location is within the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class, which compares if two instances of `BlockManager` are equal.

3. The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class is incorrectly implemented, causing the function to generate incorrect block order. This leads to the incorrect comparison of the two DataFrames, resulting in the wrong result.

4. To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should correctly identify and order the blocks, and the logic for comparison of blocks within the `equals` method needs to be revised.

5. Here is the corrected `equals` method:

```python
    # this is the corrected function
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # corrected canonicalize function
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtypes, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By applying these changes, the `canonicalize` function will correctly order the blocks, allowing for an accurate comparison of the DataFrames, thereby resolving the bug.
