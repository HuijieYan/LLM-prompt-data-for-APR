The bug in the equals() method of the BlockManager class is that canonicalize() is defined both as an instance method and as a separate function, and it is only being called as a separate function. This may lead to a NameError when canonicalize() is called inside the equals() method.

To fix this bug, the canonicalize() function should be removed from the class definition and should be defined as a separate function outside of the class. Then, the equals() method should call the canonicalize() function as a regular function.

Here's the corrected code for the equals() method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By removing the redundant definition of canonicalize() from the class and using it as a regular function, the bug has been fixed.
