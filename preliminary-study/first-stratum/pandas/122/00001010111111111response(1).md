The test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` with columns 'a' and 'b' having different data types. It then checks if they are not equal using the `equals` method, but the assertion fails.

The bug occurs in the `equals` method of the `DataFrame` class. The function compares two DataFrames element-wise and returns `False` if they are different. However, for this case, the function wrongly returns `True` for the given inputs. The bug is caused because the `equals` method does not account for differences in the location of identical blocks.

To fix the bug, the `equals` method needs to be modified to consider the locations of identical blocks. This can be achieved by modifying the comparison logic to account for the order of the blocks and their respective locations. After comparing the blocks, the `equals` method should return `False` if any differences in block orders or locations are found.

Below is the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    # Existing comparison logic for axes
    # ...

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    # Existing comparison logic for the number of blocks and their dtype
    # ...

    # Compare blocks and their locations
    self_blocks = list(self._data.blocks.items())
    other_blocks = list(other._data.blocks.items())
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        self_block = self_blocks[i]
        other_block = other_blocks[i]
        if self_block[0] != other_block[0] or self_block[1].mgr_locs != other_block[1].mgr_locs:
            return False

    return True
```

By considering the locations of identical blocks in the DataFrames, this corrected version of the `equals` method should resolve the issue and return the correct result for the test case.
