The potential error in the given function is that it is missing the `self` parameter in the `canonicalize` function, resulting in a NameError when it is called within the `equals` function.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the `canonicalize` function is defined without the `self` parameter, so when it is called within the `equals` function using `canonicalize(block)` and `canonicalize(oblock)`, it raises a NameError because it is not able to access the `canonicalize` function in the class scope.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be defined with the `self` parameter, and it should be called using `self.canonicalize(block)` and `self.canonicalize(oblock)` within the `equals` function.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # define canonicalize with self as parameter
    def canonicalize(self, block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    # call self.canonicalize instead of canonicalize
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: self.canonicalize(x))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: other.canonicalize(x))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
