Potential error location: The error may occur in the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` method.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug may be caused by the `canonicalize` function not being defined properly or being used incorrectly within the `equals` method.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: The `canonicalize` function should be properly defined within the class and should be used correctly within the `equals` method. Additionally, any typos or syntax errors within the `equals` method should be fixed.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # corrected definition of canonicalize function
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In the corrected code, the `canonicalize` function is properly defined and used within the `equals` method to sort the blocks before comparison. Any potential syntax errors or typos have also been addressed.
