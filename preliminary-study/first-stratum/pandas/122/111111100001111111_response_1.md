The issue is with the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class. The `equals` method is used to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. However, in the current implementation, it fails to correctly compare objects when they have identical blocks with different locations.

The problem occurs because the method does not account for the possibility of blocks having the same data but being located differently within the object. This results in the method incorrectly concluding that the two objects are not equal, leading to incorrect output.

To fix this issue, the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` method should be modified to include the locations of the blocks in addition to their data type. This will ensure that even if two blocks have the same data type, they will still be considered different if their locations are different.

Here's the corrected implementation of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the revised version, the `canonicalize` function incorporates the locations of the blocks, ensuring that blocks with identical data types but different locations are not incorrectly considered as equal. This fixes the bug in the `equals` method.
