The test case asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` should return False, but the error message shows that it returns True instead. This indicates that the `equals` method is not functioning correctly when comparing two DataFrames `df1` and `df2`.

Upon analyzing the code in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class, the issue seems to be with the logic for comparing blocks within the DataFrames. The bug appears to be related to the comparison of 'canonicalized' blocks to determine equality, which is currently not working as intended.

The bug occurs because the method for canonicalizing the blocks is defined twice, which may cause confusion and lead to incorrect sorting and comparison of blocks.

To fix this bug, the redundant method for canonicalizing blocks needs to be removed. Furthermore, the logic for comparing blocks in the `equals` method should be reviewed and modified to ensure correct comparison and equality checks between the blocks in the DataFrames.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    canonicalized_blocks_self = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda b: (b.dtype.name, b.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    canonicalized_blocks_other = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda b: (b.dtype.name, b.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(canonicalized_blocks_self, canonicalized_blocks_other)
    )
```

The above corrected `equals` method includes a single definition for canonicalizing the blocks. This should resolve the bug and ensure that the `equals` method works as intended for comparing DataFrames.
