1. The test case is testing the pandas DataFrame `equals` method, comparing two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` which have different data types in their columns. The test expects the `equals` method to return False, indicating that the DataFrames are not equal.

2. The potential error location within the `equals` method is the comparison between the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The code erroneously checks if the number of blocks in `self` and `other` are equal. This can lead to incorrect results when comparing DataFrames with different data types.

3. The bug occurs because the `equals` method incorrectly assumes that the number of blocks within each DataFrame is indicative of their equality. However, for DataFrames with different data types, the number of blocks may be the same, leading to the `equals` method erroneously returning True when the DataFrames are actually not equal.

4. To fix this issue, the comparison between `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` in the `equals` method should be revised. Instead of solely checking the number of blocks, the method should compare the content of the blocks to determine equality. Additionally, if the axes are not equal, the method should immediately return False.

5. Below is the corrected `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block._ref_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) and block._ref_locs.equals(oblock._ref_locs)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
