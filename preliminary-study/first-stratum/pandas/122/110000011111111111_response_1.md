The test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` is asserting that `df1.equals(df2)` should return `False`, since `df1` and `df2` have different values for the same column labels. However, the error message shows that the assertion fails, and the returned value is `True`, which is incorrect.

The potential error location within the `equals` function is the comparison of the blocks. It seems that the comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` does not yield the correct result.

The bug is occurring because the comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` is not implemented correctly. The code is trying to compare blocks using the `equals` method, but it's not ensuring that the order and arrangement of the blocks are the same in both dataframes.

To fix the bug, we need to sort the blocks in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on their type name and manager locations, and then compare them. This will ensure that the comparison is consistent and will yield the correct result.

Here's the corrected `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on their type name and manager locations, we ensure that the comparison is consistent and will yield the correct result.
