The test case provided creates two DataFrames `df3` and `df4` with columns `a` and `b` having different types of data. When calling the `equals` method on `df3` and `df4`, it is expected to return False because the data in the DataFrames is not the same.

The bug in the code seems to be in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. The issue can be identified in the comparison of blocks using the `equals` method. The comparison is not taking into account the data types and the locations of the blocks.

The bug occurs because the `equals` method is not checking for the data types and locations of the blocks before performing the comparison.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `equals` method to consider the data types and locations of the blocks when performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected `equals` method, I've added the data type of the block values to the tuple in the `canonicalize` function, and I'm using a comparison of block values and locations to ensure a more accurate equality check.

This modification should fix the bug and ensure that the `equals` method returns the correct result based on the data types and locations of the blocks.
