Analyzing the test case and the error message, we can see that the `DataFrame.equals()` method is returning True when comparing two DataFrames with the same data but different column order. 

The potential error location within the `equals` function is the sorting of the blocks using the `canonicalize` function. This function uses the block's data type name and manager locations to determine the order, but when comparing DataFrames with different column orders, this approach fails.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `canonicalize` function does not consider different column orders, causing the comparison to return True when it should be False.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the column order as well. We can concatenate the column names with the block's data type name and manager locations to create a unique identifier for each block.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (", ".join(self.columns) + "|" + block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected code, we modified the `canonicalize` function to include the column names in the sorting key by concatenating them with the block's data type name and manager locations. This change ensures that the comparison takes into account the column order and returns the correct result.
