Potential Error Location:
The error could be occurring in the comparison of the blocks using the `equals` method, as well as in the sorting of the blocks.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug could be due to the inconsistency in the sorting of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` and the comparison of the blocks using the `equals` method.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
We can fix the bug by ensuring that the blocks are sorted consistently and that the comparison using the `equals` method is done correctly.

Corrected Code:
```python
# corrected function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._type, tuple(block))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block._is_equal_to(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
