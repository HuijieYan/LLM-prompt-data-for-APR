The potential error in the given function is that the 'equals' method is being used for comparing axes and blocks, but it is not defined in the code provided. This could lead to a 'AttributeError' as the 'equals' method is not found for the objects being compared.

To fix this bug, we need to define the 'equals' method for the 'axes' and 'blocks' objects being compared. The corrected code is provided below:

```python
# corrected equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1 == ax2 for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
  
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block == oblock for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
