Potential error location: The issue lies in the `equals` method within the provided function. It fails to compare DataFrames `df3` and `df4` correctly and returns True instead of False.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the `equals` method does not properly handle the comparison between blocks with identical data but different locations.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Add code to handle the case when blocks have identical data but different locations.
2. Properly consolidate the blocks before comparison to ensure their equality.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In the corrected code, the `canonicalize` function has been modified to only consider the block values while sorting the blocks. This ensures that blocks with identical data but different locations will be compared correctly.
