The issue here seems to be with the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. When comparing two BlockManagers, it currently returns True even when the blocks have the same content but are in different locations. This is because the `canonicalize` function used to order the blocks doesn't take the block locations into account.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include block locations when ordering the blocks. This way, blocks with the same content but different locations will be considered different and the `equals` method will return False as expected.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This should fix the issue where the `equals` method was returning True for BlockManagers with identical blocks in different locations.
