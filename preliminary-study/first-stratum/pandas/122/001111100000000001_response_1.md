The potential error location within the `equals` function is at the line `def canonicalize(block):`. It seems that the `canonicalize` function is mistakenly defined within the `equals` function, but it should be a separate function, not nested inside another function.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `canonicalize` function should be a separate function but it is mistakenly defined within the `equals` function, leading to a syntax error.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be defined outside the `equals` function as a separate function.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# Define the canonicalize function as a separate function
def canonicalize(block):
    return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

# Update the equals function to use the standalone canonicalize function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By defining the `canonicalize` function separately and updating the `equals` function to use it as an external function, the bug should be fixed.
