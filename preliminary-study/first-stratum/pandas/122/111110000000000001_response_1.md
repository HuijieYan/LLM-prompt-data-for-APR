Potential Error:
The 'canonicalize' function is defined within the 'equals' function which can lead to confusion and potential errors.

Reason for the Bug:
The 'equals' function is trying to compare two BlockManager objects, and it uses the 'canonicalize' function to sort and compare the blocks. However, the 'canonicalize' function is re-defined within the 'equals' function, which can lead to confusion and potentially incorrect behavior.

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should define the 'canonicalize' function outside of the 'equals' function. This will prevent confusion and ensure that the 'equals' function can properly utilize the 'canonicalize' function.

Corrected Code:
```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other code) ...

    # this is the corrected function for equality comparison
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=self.canonicalize_blocks)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=self.canonicalize_blocks)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )

    # defining the canonicalize_blocks function outside of the equals function
    def canonicalize_blocks(self, block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
```
