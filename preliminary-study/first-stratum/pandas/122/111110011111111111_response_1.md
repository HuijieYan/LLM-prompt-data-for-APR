1. The test case `test_dataframe_not_equal()` is checking if two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` are not equal using the `equals()` method. It expects `False` but the test is failing with the error message `assert True is False`. This suggests that the `equals()` method is returning `True` incorrectly.

2. The potential error location is within the `equals()` method of the `BlockManager` class.

3. The bug occurs because within the `equals()` method, the comparison logic does not account for cases where identical blocks may have different locations. This results in incorrect evaluation of equality between the DataFrames.

4. To fix the bug, the comparison logic in the `equals()` method should be updated to account for identical blocks with different locations.

5. Corrected code for the `equals()` method:

```python
# this is the corrected equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes(), block.values.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
