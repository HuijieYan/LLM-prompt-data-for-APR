The buggy function `equals` is designed to check for equality between two instances of a class. The function compares the axes and blocks of both instances and returns False if any differences are found.

The bug in the code arises due to the improper comparison of the blocks in the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` within the `equals` function. Specifically, the function uses the `equals` method for comparison without doing any checks or handling for cases where this method might fail (or might be missing from the class definition).

To fix this bug, we should modify the method to handle the equality comparison more robustly. 

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes):
        if not ax1.equals(ax2):
            return False

    # Consolidate inplace
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Compare each block in the BlockManager
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False
    
    return True
```

In the corrected code, we iterate through the axes and explicitly check for equality, returning False at the first inequality detected. Then we consolidate the instances in place, followed by comparing each block in the BlockManager. If all the comparisons are successful, we return True to indicate the equality between the two instances.
