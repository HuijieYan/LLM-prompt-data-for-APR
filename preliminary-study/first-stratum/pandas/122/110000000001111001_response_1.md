Potential error location: The `self._consolidate_inplace()` and `other._consolidate_inplace()` lines are causing the bug because the function is trying to call a private method that may not exist.

Reasons for the occurrence of the bug: The `self._consolidate_inplace()` and `other._consolidate_inplace()` lines are attempting to call private methods from the `self` and `other` objects. If these methods do not exist or are not intended to be called in this context, it will result in a bug.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Remove the calls to `self._consolidate_inplace()` and `other._consolidate_inplace()` as it seems these private methods are not intended to be called in this context. If these methods are meant to be used, they should be made public or accessed differently.

```python
# Corrected function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
