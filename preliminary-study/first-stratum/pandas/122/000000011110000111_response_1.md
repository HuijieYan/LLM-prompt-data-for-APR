The test case is comparing two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` using the `equals` method, and the expectation is that the method should return False. However, the test is failing as the method is incorrectly returning True instead of False.

The potential error in the code lies in the `equals` method implementation. The method is comparing the DataFrames based on their axes and blocks, but it is not handling the comparison of the values within each block correctly.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `equals` method is not comparing the values within the blocks of the DataFrames, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the `equals` method should also compare the values within each block of the DataFrames. This comparison should be based on the location and the actual values of the data within each block.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = self._data.get_blocks()
    other_blocks = other._data.get_blocks()
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks.sort(key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks.sort(key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The changes made include comparing the values within each block using the `equals` method and sorting the blocks based on their canonical form before comparison to ensure consistent results.
