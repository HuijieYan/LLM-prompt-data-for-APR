Potential error location: The issue seems to be occurring in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The function is comparing the blocks of two DataFrames, but it fails to properly handle cases where the identical blocks might have different locations.

Reasons behind the bug: The `equals` function does not handle the case where identical blocks in two DataFrames may have different locations. As a result, it wrongly returns `True` instead of `False` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks in different locations.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: The `equals` function should first check if the blocks are identical in terms of content and then check if the block locations are also the same in both DataFrames.

Corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # Check for identical blocks with different locations
        def blocks_equal(block, oblock):
            return block.equals(oblock) and np.array_equal(block.items, oblock.items)
        
        return all(
            blocks_equal(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
        )
```

The updated `equals` function includes a new `blocks_equal` function that compares the content of blocks and also ensures that the block locations are the same in both DataFrames. This should fix the issue and make the `equals` function handle cases where identical blocks have different locations.
