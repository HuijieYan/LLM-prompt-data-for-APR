The test case provided is attempting to compare two dataframes `df3` and `df4` using the `equals` method. The expected result is `False` because the two dataframes have the same columns but in a different order. However, the `equals` method is mistakenly returning `True`.

The potential error in the code is with the canonicalization of block order using the `canonicalize` function. It sorts the blocks based on the combination of data type name and manager locations. This sorting does not take into account the order of columns in the dataframes, leading to incorrect comparison results.

The bug occurs because the method for comparing the dataframes relies on the sorted order of blocks, which may not accurately reflect the positional values within the actual dataframes.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be modified to consider the column order, and also the comparison should take into account the order of columns.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using both data type name and column order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), list(block))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the above changes, the `canonicalize` function now includes the column order as part of the sorting key, ensuring that the comparison takes into account the positional values within the dataframes. This should resolve the issue with the `equals` method returning incorrect results for identical blocks with different locations.
