The test case provided creates two DataFrames, df3 and df4, with columns 'a' and 'b' containing different data types. When the equals() method is called on df3 and df4, it incorrectly returns True instead of False, indicating that the two DataFrames are considered equal despite containing different data types.

The potential error in the equals() method lies in the comparison of blocks within the DataFrames. The method attempts to compare the blocks by their dtype.name and mgr_locs, but it does not take into account the possibility of identical blocks with different locations.

The bug is occurring because the canonicalization of blocks based solely on dtype.name and mgr_locs does not consider the actual content of the blocks. As a result, identical blocks with different locations are incorrectly considered unequal.

To fix this bug, the equals() method needs to compare the actual content of the blocks instead of just their dtype.name and mgr_locs.

Here's the corrected equals() method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self._data.blocks
    other_blocks = other._data.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the actual content of the blocks is compared using the equals() method, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are correctly recognized as equal.
