The error occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class in the pandas library. The `equals` function is not correctly comparing the blocks in two DataFrames, which can lead to it returning `True` even when the blocks have different locations.

The potential error location within the `equals` function is in the block comparison part where it attempts to canonicalize the blocks before comparing them. This step is necessary to handle unconsolidated blocks, but it seems to be incorrect in the current implementation.

The bug occurs because the `equals` function is not properly handling blocks that have the same content but different locations. It assumes that if the blocks have the same content, they are equal, which is not correct.

To fix this bug, the `equals` function needs to compare the blocks based on their content rather than their locations. Additionally, the function should handle unconsolidated blocks properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare blocks based on content
    self_block_values = [block.values for block in self.blocks]
    other_block_values = [block.values for block in other.blocks]
    return all(
        np.array_equal(self_val, other_val)
        for self_val, other_val in zip(self_block_values, other_block_values)
    )
```

In this corrected code, we first check if the axes of the DataFrames are the same. Then we consolidate both DataFrames. After that, we compare the blocks based on their content using `np.array_equal`. This ensures that the `equals` function returns the correct result even if the blocks have different locations.
