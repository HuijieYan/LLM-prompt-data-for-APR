The buggy function is comparing two instances of the BlockManager class, specifically their axes and blocks. It also calls the `_consolidate_inplace` method on both instances. The issue with the function seems to be the comparison of blocks between the two instances.

The function compares the blocks of both instances, and it is using the `equals` method for the comparison. The error in this implementation is that it does not account for the order of the blocks, which can result in incorrect comparisons.

To fix the bug, you can modify the canonicalize function to include the block's position and then use it for comparison. By sorting and comparing the blocks based on the calculated canonical representation, the function should be able to correctly compare the two BlockManager instances, accounting for the order of the blocks.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name, mgr_locs, and position
    def canonicalize(block, position):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), position)

    self_blocks = sorted([(block, idx) for idx, block in enumerate(self.blocks)], key=lambda x: canonicalize(x[0], x[1]))
    other_blocks = sorted([(block, idx) for idx, block in enumerate(other.blocks)], key=lambda x: canonicalize(x[0], x[1]))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for (block, _), (oblock, _) in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
