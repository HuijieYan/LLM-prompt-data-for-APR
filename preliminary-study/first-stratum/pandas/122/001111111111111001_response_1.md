The test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` is trying to compare two dataframes `df1` and `df2` and asserting that they are not equal. However, the error message is indicating that the comparison is evaluating to True instead of False.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. 

The bug occurs because the `equals` method is not correctly implemented. The implementation currently is comparing the dataframes directly, which is not the correct way to compare them. Additionally, there is a redundant `equals` method defined in the `BlockManager` class.

To fix the bug, the `equals` method should be updated to compare the underlying data blocks of the dataframes instead of the dataframes themselves.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the equals method
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected implementation, the `equals` method will compare the underlying data blocks of the dataframes, ensuring that they are correctly compared for equality.
