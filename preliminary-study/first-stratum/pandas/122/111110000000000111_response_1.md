The issue arises in the `equals` method of the BlockManager class. The problem is that the method incorrectly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations. This is due to the comparison of blocks without considering their locations.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` method to account for the block locations when comparing the blocks between two DataFrames.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
# corrected equals method
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, including block locations, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By considering the block locations in the comparison, the corrected `equals` method will now correctly identify cases where identical blocks exist in different locations and return the expected result.
