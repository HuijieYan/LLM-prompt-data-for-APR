The issue is occurring because the `equals` method is mistakenly identifying DataFrames with different block locations but identical content as equal. This is not the expected behavior, and the test case provided should return False instead.

The problem lies in the sorting of the blocks before comparison in the `equals` method. The `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks should take into account the locations of the blocks to avoid the issue of identical blocks with different locations being erroneously identified as equal.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should take both the dtype name and the mgr_locs (block locations) into account for sorting the blocks.

Here's the corrected `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `canonicalize` function now considers both the dtype name and the mgr_locs of the blocks for sorting, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are not erroneously identified as equal.
