The test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` is comparing two dataframes `df1` and `df2` using the `.equals` method, expecting it to return `False`. However, the error message shows that the assertion is failing, indicating that the `.equals` method is not working as expected.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. It seems that the code within the `equals` method is not correctly comparing the two dataframes `self` and `other`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `equals` method is not correctly comparing the two dataframes. It might be an issue with the logic used for comparison or the implementation of sorting and comparison for blocks.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to revise the logic for comparing the blocks within the `equals` method. This could involve inspecting the implementation of the `equals` method, identifying any incorrect comparisons, and adjusting the logic to accurately compare the two dataframes.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected code, the logic for comparison and sorting of blocks has been adjusted to accurately compare the two dataframes. This should resolve the issue with the `.equals` method.
