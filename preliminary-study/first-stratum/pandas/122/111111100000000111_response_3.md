The `equals` method is used to compare two DataFrames and determine if they contain the same elements. However, the current implementation does not handle identical blocks with different locations correctly. In the provided test case, `df3` and `df4` have the same elements but in a different order. The `equals` method should return False in this case, but it doesn't. 

The bug is most likely occurring due to the comparison of blocks without considering their locations. When comparing the blocks, the function needs to consider the block order and their locations to correctly determine equality.

To fix the bug, the `equals` method needs to be modified to properly handle identical blocks with different locations. This can be achieved by modifying the canonicalize function to include block locations when sorting the blocks. This way, blocks with different locations will not be mistakenly considered equal.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.T.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function includes block locations when sorting the blocks using `mgr_locs.as_array.T.tobytes()` to ensure that blocks with different locations are not mistakenly considered equal.
