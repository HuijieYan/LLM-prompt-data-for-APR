The test case provided creates two dataframes, df3 and df4, with the same data but in a different order. The expected output is for df3.equals(df4) to return False because the dataframes have different locations for the same data.

The potential error location in the function is the comparison of blocks in the 'equals' method. The function compares the blocks without taking into account their locations, which can lead to incorrect results when comparing dataframes with the same data in different locations.

The reason behind the bug is that the function does not consider the locations of the blocks when comparing them. This leads to the incorrect output when comparing dataframes with the same data but different block locations.

To fix the bug, the 'equals' method should consider the locations of the blocks when comparing them. This can be achieved by modifying the 'canonicalize' function to include block locations when creating the tuple for comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the 'equals' method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.to_numpy()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the 'canonicalize' function now uses 'block.mgr_locs.to_numpy()' to include block locations when creating the tuple. This ensures that the comparison takes into account the locations of the blocks, which fixes the bug in the 'equals' method.
