The test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` is trying to assert that two dataframes `df1` and `df2` are not equal.

The error message indicates that the assertion failed because it expected `True` to be `False`.

The potential error in the code is within the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. The equal comparison is not handling cases where the dataframes have the same columns and indices, but the data in the columns is not the same.

The reason for the bug is that the `equals` method is not properly checking for the equality of the data within the dataframes.

To fix the bug, the `equals` method needs to be updated to compare the data within the dataframes. This can be achieved using the `values` attribute of the dataframes.

Here's the corrected `equals` method for the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not np.array_equal(self.blocks[i].values, other.blocks[i].values):
            return False

    return True
```

This update ensures that the data within the dataframes is being compared for equality in addition to checking the axes. Now the `equals` method should work properly and fix the bug in the original code.
