The `equals` method is supposed to compare two DataFrames and return True if they are equal, and False if they are not. 

Looking at the error message from the test function, it seems that the `equals` method is returning True instead of False when comparing two DataFrames that should not be equal. This indicates that the bug is in the `equals` method.

The potential error location within the buggy function is likely the comparison of the values in the two DataFrames. It seems that the method is not correctly handling the comparison between the values of the DataFrames.

The reason behind this bug could be that the method is not properly comparing the values in the DataFrames. It could be an issue with how the values are being handled during the comparison.

To fix the bug, the `equals` method should be modified to correctly compare the values in the DataFrames and return the appropriate boolean result.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    for self_col, other_col in zip(self.values.T, other.values.T):
        if not np.array_equal(self_col, other_col):
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected code, the method now iterates through the columns of the DataFrames and uses `np.array_equal` to compare the values of the DataFrames. This will correctly handle the comparison of values and return the appropriate result.
