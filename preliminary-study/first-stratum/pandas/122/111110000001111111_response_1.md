The issue seems to be with the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class. This function is comparing the two instances of `BlockManager` based on their internal blocks, but it is not taking into account the ordering of the blocks.

The `equals` function first compares the axes of the two `BlockManager` instances, then consolidates the blocks in place for both instances, and finally checks if the blocks are equal.

The bug occurring in this case seems to be due to the inconsistent block ordering when comparing the two `BlockManager` instances. This leads to unequal blocks being compared as equal due to the order in which they are traversed.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to take into account the order of the blocks during comparison. Once the blocks are sorted based on a canonical key (dtype.name and mgr_locs), the comparison can be made, ensuring that the block ordering doesn't affect the result.

Here's the corrected `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Get canonical keys for each block
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, list(block.mgr_locs.as_array))

    # Sort the blocks based on the canonical key
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Compare the sorted blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected function addresses the issue of block ordering by sorting the blocks based on a canonical key before comparison.

This fix should resolve the bug and ensure that the `equals` function returns the expected result in the given test case.
