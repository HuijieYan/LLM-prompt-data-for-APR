The test case provided seems to be comparing two DataFrames `df3` and `df4` which have the same data but different column orders. It is expected that the `equals` function should return False in this case, but it is probably returning True due to the bug in the implementation of the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class.

The potential error location within the `equals` method is when sorting the blocks using the `canonicalize` function. This sorting is meant to ensure that even if the blocks are in different locations, as long as they contain the same data, the `equals` method should return True. However, the current implementation is not able to handle the scenario where the locations don't match.

The reason behind the bug is that the `canonicalize` function is not taking into account the block's locations, and only considers the type name and `mgr_locs`. This causes identical blocks with different locations to be wrongly treated as unequal.

To fix this bug, the `canonicalize` function should also include the locations of the blocks when creating the tuple for sorting.

Here is the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name, mgr_locs, and dtype, because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (
                block.dtype.name, 
                block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), 
                block.values.dtype
            )
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

The additional inclusion of `block.values.dtype` in the `canonicalize` function's return tuple will ensure that the blocks are also compared based on their data types, which could be essential for proper comparison.
