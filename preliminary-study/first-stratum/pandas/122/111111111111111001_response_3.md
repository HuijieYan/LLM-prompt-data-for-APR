The bug is occurring in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. The method is comparing two `BlockManager` objects `self` and `other` for equality. The code for the `equals` method is trying to compare the attributes and blocks of the two objects to determine their equality.

The bug occurs because the comparison logic within the method is incorrect. It is comparing the axes and blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects without proper ordering or canonicalization, leading to incorrect comparisons.

To fix the bug, we need to sort the blocks and then compare them to ensure that the comparison is in the correct order and the method produces the expected result.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` method should produce the expected result and pass the provided test case.
