The test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` is trying to compare two dataframes `df1` and `df2` using the `equals` method and expects the comparison to return `False`. However, the test fails and returns `True is False`, indicating that the `equals` method is incorrectly returning `True`.

The potential error location within the `equals` function is the sorting of the blocks using the `canonicalize` function. This sorting might lead to the incorrect comparison of dataframes.

The bug occurs because the original implementation of the `equals` function sorts the blocks of each dataframe using the `canonicalize` function, which may not produce the correct order for comparison.

One possible approach for fixing the bug would be to directly compare blocks in the `equals` function without sorting them. This would ensure that the comparison is done based on the original order of blocks in the dataframes.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected implementation, the bug causing the incorrect return of `True` in cases of identical blocks with different locations should be resolved.
