1. The test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` is attempting to assert that `df1.equals(df2)` is False. However, the error message shows that the assertion is failing because `True is False`.

2. The potential error location within the buggy function is in the `equals` method, where the comparison between blocks is being performed.

3. The bug occurs because the comparison of blocks inside the `equals` method does not take into account the order of elements within the block, leading to incorrect results when comparing DataFrames with the same elements but in a different order.

4. To fix the bug, we need to update the comparison logic in the `equals` method to consider the order of elements within the blocks. This can be achieved by sorting the blocks based on their content before comparing them.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, sorted(block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `canonicalize` function has been updated to sort the block's `mgr_locs` before creating the tuple for comparison. This ensures that the comparison considers the order of elements within the blocks, fixing the bug.
