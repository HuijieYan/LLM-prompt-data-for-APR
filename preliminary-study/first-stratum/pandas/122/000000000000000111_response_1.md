The test case provided is comparing two dataframes, df3 and df4, which have the same columns ('a' and 'b') but the data within each column are swapped. The expected output is False because the dataframes are not identical.

The potential error location within the function is the part where it checks if the blocks are equal using the 'equals' method. 

The bug occurs because the function incorrectly returns True for dataframes with identical blocks but different locations. This is because the function does not take into account the actual data within the blocks, but only their order and type.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison part of the function to compare the actual data within the blocks, instead of just their order and type.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self._get_numeric_data().values
    other_blocks = other._get_numeric_data().values
    return np.array_equal(self_blocks, other_blocks)
``` 

In the corrected code, we are comparing the actual data within the blocks using the `np.array_equal` method, which will correctly compare the data within the blocks regardless of their location. This should fix the bug and provide the expected output for the given test case.
