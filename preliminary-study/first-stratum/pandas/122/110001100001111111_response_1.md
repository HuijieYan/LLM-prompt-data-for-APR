Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the `equals` method in the given code. It compares the DataFrames `self` and `other` for equality.

Reason behind the bug: The bug occurs because the method does not properly handle identical blocks with different locations. It compares the blocks using their locations, which may lead to incorrect equality comparison.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Sort the blocks based on their content rather than their location.
2. Consider using the `iloc` method to compare the DataFrames more accurately.

Corrected code for the `equals` method:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block content
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block._fastpath)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
