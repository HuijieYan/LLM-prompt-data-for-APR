Potential error location:
The error might be occurring in the canonicalize function within the equals method. This is because the function is not defined as a class method, and it should be for it to be accessed within the BlockManager class.

Reason behind the bug:
The bug is occurring because the canonicalize function is not defined as a class method, so it cannot be accessed within the BlockManager class.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
Define the canonicalize function as a class method within the BlockManager class so that it can be accessed within the equals method.

Corrected code for the equals method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Define canonicalize function as a class method
    def canonicalize(self, block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.values.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: canonicalize(self, block))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: canonicalize(other, block))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
