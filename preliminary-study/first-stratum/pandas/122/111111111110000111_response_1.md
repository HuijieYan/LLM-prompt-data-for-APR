The test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` is comparing two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` using the `equals` method, and it expects them to be unequal. However, the test fails because the `equals` method is returning `True` when it should return `False`.

The potential error location is within the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class, specifically in the block comparison logic implemented with the `canonicalize` function. This logic is used to compare blocks with potentially different locations. 

The bug occurs because the block comparison logic in the `equals` method does not correctly handle the scenario where two equally structured DataFrames could have blocks in different locations, and therefore should not be considered equal.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic in the `equals` method needs to be updated to properly handle the scenario where blocks are in different locations.

The corrected code for the `equals` method is as follows:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes(), block.mgr_locs.as_array)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `canonicalize` function now uses the bytes representation of the block locations as a tuple, rather than the dtype name, to ensure that blocks with different locations are properly compared.

Once the `equals` method is corrected, the test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass without any assertion errors.
