The test case df1.equals(df2) failed, indicating that the equals() method of DataFrame is returning an incorrect value. This suggests that there might be a bug in the equals() method implementation for DataFrame.

Looking at the bug description and the test case, it seems that the equals() method is not correctly comparing the two DataFrames df1 and df2. The method should return False because the two DataFrames have identical blocks with different locations, which should make them not equal.

The buggy function 'equals' in the 'BlockManager' class is likely the source of the problem. The 'equals' method compares the axes and blocks of two BlockManager objects to determine equality. However, it seems that the comparison logic is flawed, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic in the 'equals' method of the 'BlockManager' class needs to be revised. The comparison logic should account for the possibility of identical blocks with different locations, and proper handling of this scenario should be implemented.

Here's the corrected 'equals' method for the 'BlockManager' class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, BlockManager):
        return False
    
    if self.axes != other.axes:
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected 'equals' method, the comparison logic checks if the axes match and then proceeds to compare the blocks while accounting for identical blocks with different locations.

This fix should address the bug by ensuring that the 'equals' method correctly compares BlockManager instances and returns the expected result in scenarios where there are identical blocks with different locations. After applying this fix, the test case df1.equals(df2) should pass as expected.
