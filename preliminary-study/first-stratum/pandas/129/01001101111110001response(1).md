The error message "ValueError: Unexpected type 'datetime64'. 'values' must be a DatetimeArray ndarray, or Series or Index containing one of those" suggests that the function is trying to perform an operation with an inappropriate type, specifically a 'datetime64' type.

The issue in the provided function is that the logic is not handling the 'datetime64' type properly, leading to the ValueError. The specific part of the function that needs to be corrected is where the 'datetime64' type is being handled.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the 'datetime64' type appropriately. We can address this by updating the logic for handling 'datetime64' type in the '__rsub__' method.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        # ndarray[datetime64] cannot be subtracted from self, so
        # we need to wrap in DatetimeArray/Index and flip the operation
        if not isinstance(other, (DatetimeIndex, DatetimeArray)):
            # Avoid down-casting DatetimeIndex
            other = DatetimeArray(other)
        return other - self
    elif (
        is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype)
        and hasattr(other, "dtype")
        and not is_datetime64_any_dtype(other)
    ):
        # GH#19959 datetime - datetime is well-defined as timedelta,
        # but any other type - datetime is not well-defined.
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {typ} from {cls}".format(
                typ=type(other).__name__, cls=type(self).__name__
            )
        )
    elif is_period_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other.dtype):
        # TODO: Can we simplify/generalize these cases at all?
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {dtype} from {cls}".format(
                dtype=other.dtype, cls=type(self).__name__
            )
        )
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if lib.is_integer(other) or is_integer_dtype(other):
            # need to subtract before negating, since that flips freq
            # -self flips self.freq, messing up results
            return -(self - other)

        return (-self) + other

    return -(self - other)
```

By handling the 'datetime64' type appropriately and addressing the other conditions in the function, this code should resolve the bug and prevent the ValueError from occurring in the test cases.
