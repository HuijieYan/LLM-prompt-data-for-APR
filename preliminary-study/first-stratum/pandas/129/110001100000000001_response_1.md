Potential error location: The code has several conditional statements and it's possible that some of them are not covering all the cases correctly, leading to unexpected behavior.

Reasons behind the bug: The current implementation of the function does not handle all cases correctly when subtracting datetime-like objects or other data types.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Review and update the conditional statements to ensure that all cases are covered and handled correctly.
2. Test the function with different types of input data to verify its correctness.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    # Check if other is datetime64 and self is timedelta64
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        # Wrap other in DatetimeArray if needed and perform subtraction
        if not isinstance(other, DatetimeLikeArrayMixin):
            from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray
            other = DatetimeArray(other)
        return other - self
    # Check if self is datetime64 and other is not datetime
    elif is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype) and hasattr(other, "dtype") and not is_datetime64_any_dtype(other.dtype):
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {cls} from {typ}".format(
                cls=type(self).__name__, typ=type(other).__name__
            )
        )
    # Check if self is period dtype and other is timedelta64
    elif is_period_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other):
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {cls} from {dtype}".format(
                cls=type(self).__name__, dtype=other.dtype
            )
        )
    # Check if self is timedelta64
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        # Check if other is integer type, perform subtraction and negation
        if lib.is_integer(other) or is_integer_dtype(other):
            return -(self - other)
        # Perform negation and addition
        return (-self) + other
    # Perform subtraction and negation
    return -(self - other)
```
