Potential bug location:
The likely bug occurs in the `__rsub__` method of the `DatetimeLikeArrayMixin` class. This method seems to be having issues when attempting to handle subtraction operations involving different types of datetime-like objects.

Reasons behind the bug:
The bug is likely caused by incorrect handling of the subtraction operation within different conditions and data types. This could lead to unexpected behavior when attempting to subtract a `DatetimeLikeArrayMixin` object from another object.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the conditions and data types to ensure that the correct subtraction operations are performed for different types of datetime-like objects.
2. Validate the input data types and handle the subtraction accordingly to avoid unexpected errors.
3. Utilize proper type checking and conversion methods to ensure consistent behavior when performing subtraction operations with datetime-like arrays.

Corrected code:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if not isinstance(other, DatetimeLikeArrayMixin):
            from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray
            other = DatetimeArray(other)
        return other - self

    elif is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype) and hasattr(other, "dtype") and not is_datetime64_any_dtype(other.dtype):
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {cls} from {typ}".format(
                cls=type(self).__name__, typ=type(other).__name__
            )
        )
    elif is_period_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other):
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {cls} from {dtype}".format(
                cls=type(self).__name__, dtype=other.dtype
            )
        )
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if lib.is_integer(other) or is_integer_dtype(other):
            return self + other
        return self - other

    return self - other
```
The corrected code includes conditional checks for different data types and ensures that the subtraction operations are handled appropriately. This should help resolve the issues encountered during subtraction operations involving datetime-like arrays.
