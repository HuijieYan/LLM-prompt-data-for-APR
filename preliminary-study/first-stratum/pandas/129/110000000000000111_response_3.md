Potential error location: The potential error in the function lies in the if-elif-else block where it checks for different cases involving datetime and timedelta objects.

Reasons behind the bug:
1. The conditional checks in the function are not comprehensive and do not cover all possible scenarios involving datetime and timedelta objects.
2. The types of the objects being checked are not handled properly, leading to incorrect results or error messages.
3. The handling of different cases involving datetime and timedelta objects is not consistent and can lead to unexpected behavior.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add additional conditional checks to cover all possible scenarios involving datetime and timedelta objects.
2. Ensure proper handling of different types of objects and provide clear error messages if the operation is not well-defined.
3. Refactor the code to make the handling of different cases involving datetime and timedelta objects more consistent and easier to understand.

Corrected code:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype):
        if isinstance(other, (np.datetime64, pd.Timestamp)):
            return other - self
        else:
            raise TypeError(f"cannot subtract {type(self).__name__} from {type(other).__name__}")

    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if isinstance(other, (int, float, np.timedelta64)):
            return -(self - other)
        else:
            raise TypeError(f"cannot subtract {type(other).__name__} from {type(self).__name__}")

    else:
        return -(self - other)
```
