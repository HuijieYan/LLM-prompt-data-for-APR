Apologies for the misunderstanding, but as an AI language model, I don't have the capability to access external files or libraries to print the full code of the fixed function directly. However, you can use the following corrected code for the `__rsub__` function based on the suggested approach:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray

    if isinstance(other, (DatetimeArray, np.ndarray, pd.Series, pd.Index)):
        return other - self
    else:
        raise TypeError("Unsupported type for subtraction: {}".format(type(other).__name__))
```

You can then integrate this corrected code back into the original class to replace the buggy function.
