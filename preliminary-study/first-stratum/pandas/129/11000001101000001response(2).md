Potential error location:
The potential error lies in the conditional block for checking the dtype of the `self` and `other` variables, as well as in the subsequent operations based on these conditions.

Reasons behind the bug:
The function fails to handle the subtraction operations properly based on the data types and conditional checks, which leads to unexpected behavior and potentially causes the function to crash or provide incorrect results.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add explicit checks and conversion for the datetime and timedelta data types to ensure that the subtraction operations are handled correctly.
2. Refactor the conditional blocks to enhance readability and maintainability.
3. Include a proper error handling mechanism to raise meaningful exceptions if the subtraction operations are not well-defined for the given data types.

Corrected code:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    self_datetime = is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype)
    other_datetime = is_datetime64_any_dtype(other)

    if self_datetime and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if not isinstance(other, DatetimeLikeArrayMixin):
            from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray
            other = DatetimeArray(other)
        return other - self
    elif (self_datetime and hasattr(other, "dtype") and not is_datetime64_any_dtype(other.dtype)):
        raise TypeError("cannot subtract {cls} from {typ}".format(cls=type(self).__name__, typ=type(other).__name__))
    elif is_period_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other):
        raise TypeError("cannot subtract {cls} from {dtype}".format(cls=type(self).__name__, dtype=other.dtype))
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if lib.is_integer(other) or is_integer_dtype(other):
            return -(self - other)
        return (-self) + other

    return -(self - other)
```
