The buggy function has multiple conditional statements that are not properly handling the various input cases and their corresponding data types. In some cases, the code raises a TypeError, but it does not handle all cases properly.

The buggy function is supposed to handle different data types and perform arithmetic operations accordingly. However, in the given code, the conditional checks and operations are not comprehensive, leading to incorrect behavior and potential errors when dealing with different types of input data.

To fix the bug, the conditional statements need to be rewritten to handle the different data types and input cases properly. This involves carefully checking the data types, ensuring that the arithmetic operations are correctly performed, and handling edge cases to avoid raising incorrect TypeErrors.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other.dtype):
        return -other + self  # Performing arithmetic operation between datetime64 and timedelta64
    elif is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype) and is_datetime64_any_dtype(other.dtype):
        return other - self  # Performing arithmetic operation between two datetime64 values
    elif is_period_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other.dtype):
        raise TypeError("cannot subtract {cls} from {dtype}".format(cls=type(self).__name__, dtype=other.dtype))
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other.dtype):
        return -other + self  # Performing arithmetic operation between two timedelta64 values
    else:
        raise TypeError("cannot subtract {cls} from {typ}".format(cls=type(other).__name__, typ=type(self).__name__))
```
