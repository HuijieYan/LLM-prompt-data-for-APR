Potential Error Location: The main error in the __rsub__ function is the conditional statement for is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype), as it seems to be conflicting with the subsequent logic.

Reasons for Bug: The bug seems to be caused by incorrect conditional statements and unclear logic for handling different data types and operations.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use clearer conditional statements to handle different data types and operations.
2. Ensure that the logic for each type of data is properly defined and handled.
3. Refactor the code to improve readability and maintainability.
4. Consider using separate methods for different data type operations to improve code organization and maintainability.

Corrected Code:
```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    import pandas.core.arrays as pdarr
    
    if pdarr.is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and pdarr.is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        return pdarr.DatetimeArray(other) - self
    elif pdarr.is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype) and hasattr(other, "dtype") and not pdarr.is_datetime64_any_dtype(other.dtype):
        raise TypeError("cannot subtract {cls} from {typ}".format(cls=type(self).__name__, typ=type(other).__name__))
    elif pdarr.is_period_dtype(self.dtype) and pdarr.is_timedelta64_dtype(other):
        raise TypeError("cannot subtract {cls} from {dtype}".format(cls=type(self).__name__, dtype=other.dtype))
    elif pdarr.is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if pdarr.lib.is_integer(other) or pdarr.is_integer_dtype(other):
            return -(self + other)  # fixed the logic for subtracting integers
        else:
            return (-self) + other  # fixed the logic for other cases
    else:
        return -(self + other)  # fixed the default logic for subtraction
```
