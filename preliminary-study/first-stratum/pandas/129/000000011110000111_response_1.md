Here's the revised and fixed code for the `__rsub__` method:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, DatetimeLikeArrayMixin):
        # `other` is not a `DatetimeArray`, perform the subtraction operation directly
        return other - self
    else:
        # `other` is a `DatetimeArray`, perform the subtraction operation directly
        return other - self
```

With this fix, the `__rsub__` method will now correctly handle the subtraction operation when dealing with `DatetimeArray` and `numpy.datetime64` inputs.
