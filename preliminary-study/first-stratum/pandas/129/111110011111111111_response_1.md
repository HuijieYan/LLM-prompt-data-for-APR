The problem occurs in the `__rsub__` method of the `DatetimeLikeArrayMixin` class. The error message indicates that a `TypeError` occurs during the creation of a `DatetimeArray` object. This is due to the unexpected type 'datetime64' being passed to the `DatetimeArray` constructor.

The `__rsub__` method is used for the reversed subtraction operation on the Datetime-like arrays. The issue arises in the conditional block of the method, where the type of the `other` parameter is not being handled properly.

To fix this, you can modify the conditional block that checks if the `other` parameter is a `DatetimeArray` and should then directly subtract from `self`. This can be done using the `__sub__` method as shown in the corrected code below.

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other):
            return other - self
        elif is_timedelta64_dtype(other):
            return other + self
        elif is_period_dtype(other.dtype):
            raise TypeError("Cannot subtract from period dtype")
        else:
            raise TypeError(
                "unsupported operand type(s) for -: "
                "'DatetimeLikeArrayMixin' and '{other_type}'".format(
                    other_type=type(other).__name__
                )
            )
    else:
        raise TypeError("unsupported operand type(s) for -: " "datetime and 'DatetimeLikeArrayMixin'")
```

In the corrected code, the method handles different cases of the `other` parameter based on its type and the type of `self`.

By using this fixed implementation of the `__rsub__` method, the issue with the creation of the `DatetimeArray` object will be resolved, and the subtraction operation on the Datetime-like arrays should work correctly.
