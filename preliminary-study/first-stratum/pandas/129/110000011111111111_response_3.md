The error in the provided code occurs because the function `__rsub__` is trying to create a `DatetimeArray` from the `other` parameter, which is not compatible. The error message suggests that the `DatetimeArray` object is being created with an unexpected type, which is causing the `ValueError`.

The potential error location is identified as the line where the `DatetimeArray` is being created:
```python
other = DatetimeArray(other)
```

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the input `other` parameter is of type `Timestamp` or `datetime`, and it is being directly attempted to convert into a `DatetimeArray`, which is the incorrect approach.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `__rsub__` function by extending the conditions and logic based on the type of the input parameters. For `Timestamp` and `datetime` inputs, we should handle the subtraction operation differently without creating a `DatetimeArray`.

Here's the corrected code for the `__rsub__` function:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if isinstance(other, (Timestamp, datetime)) or is_datetime64_any_dtype(other.dtype):
            return other - self
        else:
            raise TypeError("cannot subtract {cls} from {typ}".format(cls=type(self).__name__, typ=type(other).__name__))
    # Add other conditions and handling for is_period_dtype, is_timedelta64_dtype, etc.
    # ...
    else:
        return -(self - other)
```

By adding the condition to handle `Timestamp` and `datetime` inputs explicitly without creating a `DatetimeArray`, we can resolve the issue and prevent the ValueError from occurring during the subtraction operation.
