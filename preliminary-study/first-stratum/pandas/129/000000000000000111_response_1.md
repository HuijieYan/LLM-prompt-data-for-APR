Potential error:
The potential error in this code is that the `__rsub__` method is not properly handling the subtraction operations for different data types, such as datetime, timedelta, and integer.

Reason for the bug:
The bug is likely occurring due to improper handling of different data types and their subtraction operations within the function. The conditional statements and their logic may not be handling all possible combinations of data types and operations correctly.

Approach for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the subtraction operations for different data types. This can be achieved by accurately identifying the data types involved in the subtraction and providing the correct outputs for each combination of data types.

Corrected code:
```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if not isinstance(other, DatetimeLikeArrayMixin):
            # Avoid down-casting DatetimeIndex
            from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray
            other = DatetimeArray(other)
        return other - self
    elif is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype) and not is_datetime64_any_dtype(other):
        # Subtracting a timedelta from a datetime is well-defined
        return self - pd.Timedelta(other)
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other):
        return pd.Timedelta(self) - other
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype) and not is_timedelta64_dtype(other) and not is_datetime64_any_dtype(other):
        # Assuming subtraction for non-datetime and non-timedelta is arithmetic
        return self - other
    else:
        raise TypeError(
            "unsupported operand type(s) for -: '{}' and '{}'".format(
                type(self).__name__, type(other).__name__
            )
        )
```
