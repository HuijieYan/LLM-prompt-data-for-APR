The error occurs in the `__rsub__` method of the `DatetimeLikeArrayMixin` class. It seems that the class `DatetimeArray` is being instantiated with an argument of type `datetime64`, which is causing the ValueError. This instantiation occurs when `other` is a `Timestamp` and `self.dtype` is `dtype('<m8[ns]')` with `self` being a `TimedeltaArray`.

The bug occurs because the `DatetimeArray` class expects the input value to be an ndarray of a datetime type, or a Series or Index containing one of those types. However, in the buggy function, it's directly instantiating a `DatetimeArray` with an input that doesn't conform to these expectations.

To fix the bug, the `__rsub__` method should check the type of `other` before instantiating a `DatetimeArray`. If `other` is a numpy datetime64 object, it should be converted into an array or series of datetime objects before being passed to the `DatetimeArray` constructor. This ensures that the input type is aligned with the expectations of the `DatetimeArray` constructor.

Here's the corrected code for the `__rsub__` method:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
        if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
            if not isinstance(other, DatetimeLikeArrayMixin):
                from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray
                other = DatetimeArray(pd.Series([other]))

            return other - self
        elif (
            is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype)
            and hasattr(other, "dtype")
            and not is_datetime64_any_dtype(other.dtype)
        ):
            raise TypeError(
                "cannot subtract {cls} from {typ}".format(
                    cls=type(self).__name__, typ=type(other).__name__
                )
            )
        elif is_period_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other):
            raise TypeError(
                "cannot subtract {cls} from {dtype}".format(
                    cls=type(self).__name__, dtype=other.dtype
                )
            )
        elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
            if lib.is_integer(other) or is_integer_dtype(other):
                return -(self - other)

            return (-self) + other

        return -(self - other)
```
This code modification ensures that `other` is wrapped in a `DatetimeArray` only if it's not already an instance of `DatetimeLikeArrayMixin`, and it's directly converted to a Series of datetime objects before being passed to `DatetimeArray`.

This approach addresses the type mismatch issue and ensures that the `DatetimeArray` is correctly instantiated.
