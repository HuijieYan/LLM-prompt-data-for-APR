The error is occurring when trying to perform subtraction operations with a DatetimeArray argument. The error indicates that the 'values' passed to the DatetimeArray constructor is of type 'datetime64', causing a ValueError.

The buggy function __rsub__ is intended to handle subtraction operations when the left-hand operand is not of type DatetimeArray (or a similar type) but the right-hand operand is. The error is occurring when trying to create a DatetimeArray from the 'other' argument, which is expected to already be of this type.

To fix this issue, it's necessary to modify the __rsub__ function to correctly handle different types of operands. Specifically, when the right-hand operand 'other' is already a DatetimeArray, there is no need to create another instance of DatetimeArray. It should directly perform the subtraction operation using 'self'. This modification will resolve the issue where the 'other' being passed to DatetimeArray is already of type 'datetime64', causing the ValueError.

Here's the corrected code for the __rsub__ function:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
      if not isinstance(other, DatetimeLikeArrayMixin):
          # Avoid down-casting DatetimeIndex
          from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray
          other = DatetimeArray(other)
      return other - self
    else:
      return super().__rsub__(other)
```
In the corrected code, the original logic for handling the operation when 'other' is already a DatetimeArray is preserved, and in all other cases, it falls back to the default behavior for the subtraction operation.
