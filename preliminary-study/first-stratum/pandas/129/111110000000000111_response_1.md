The potential error in the `__rsub__` function is the way it handles the subtraction and negation operations for different data types. It appears that the logic for handling various data types in the subtraction operation is not correctly implemented, leading to potential errors.

The bug occurs because the logic for handling different data types in the subtraction operation is not comprehensive and may lead to incorrect results or unintended behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to rewrite the logic for handling different data types in the subtraction operation and ensure that the correct operations are performed based on the data types involved.

Here's the corrected code for the `__rsub__` function:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
        if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
            # ndarray[datetime64] cannot be subtracted from self, so
            # we need to wrap in DatetimeArray/Index and flip the operation
            if not isinstance(other, DatetimeLikeArrayMixin):
                from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray
    
                other = DatetimeArray(other)
            return other - self
        elif (
            is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype)
            and hasattr(other, "dtype")
            and not is_datetime64_any_dtype(other.dtype)
        ):
            # GH#19959 datetime - datetime is well-defined as timedelta,
            # but any other type - datetime is not well-defined.
            raise TypeError(
                "cannot subtract {cls} from {typ}".format(
                    cls=type(self).__name__, typ=type(other).__name__
                )
            )
        elif is_period_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other.dtype):
            return self._generate_range.__rsub__(other)
        elif is_period_dtype(self.dtype) and is_period_dtype(other.dtype):
            return self.astype("int64") - other.astype("int64")
        elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
            if lib.is_integer(other) or is_integer_dtype(other):
                # need to subtract before negating, since that flips freq
                # -self flips self.freq, messing up results
                return -(self - other)
            return self._generate_range.__rsub__(other)
    
        return -(self - other)
```
In the corrected code, we have added additional checks for the data types involved in the subtraction operation and handle each case appropriately to ensure correct results and avoid unintended behavior.
