The error occurs in the `__rsub__` method of the `DatetimeLikeArrayMixin` class. This method is used for the right-hand subtraction operation when a datetime-like object is the left operand and the array is the right operand.

The error message indicates that the issue is related to the creation of a `DatetimeArray` object from the `other` value. The error is raised because the code is attempting to instantiate a `DatetimeArray` object using the `other` value, which is of type `datetime64`, and this type is not compatible with the `DatetimeArray` object that is expected.

To fix this bug, the `__rsub__` method should handle the right subtraction operation with more generalized support for different types of operands. It needs to be updated to handle the specific datatypes and their operations more accurately.

Here's the corrected `__rsub__` method:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        # ndarray[datetime64] cannot be subtracted from self, so
        # we need to wrap in DatetimeArray/Index and flip the operation
        if not isinstance(other, (DatetimeLikeArrayMixin, pd.DatetimeIndex)):
            # Avoid down-casting DatetimeIndex
            from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray

            other = DatetimeArray(other)
        return other - self
    elif (
        is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype)
        and hasattr(other, "dtype")
        and not is_datetime64_any_dtype(other.dtype)
    ):
        # GH#19959 datetime - datetime is well-defined as timedelta,
        # but any other type - datetime is not well-defined.
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {cls} from {typ}".format(
                cls=type(self).__name__, typ=type(other).__name__
            )
        )
    elif is_period_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other.dtype):
        # TODO: Can we simplify/generalize these cases at all?
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {cls} from {dtype}".format(
                cls=type(self).__name__, dtype=other.dtype
            )
        )
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if lib.is_integer(other) or is_integer_dtype(other):
            # need to subtract before negating, since that flips freq
            # -self flips self.freq, messing up results
            return -(self - other)

        return (-self) + other
    else:
        return -(self - other)
```

With this correction, the `__rsub__` method will be able to properly handle the right subtraction operation with various types of operands and avoid the ValueError related to the creation of a `DatetimeArray` object.
