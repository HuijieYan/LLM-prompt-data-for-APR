Potential Error:
It seems that the code is trying to perform arithmetic operations involving datetimes, timedeltas, and other numpy types. The error message indicates that the subtraction operation between the datetime and timedelta is not well-defined.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug may be occurring due to the mismatch in the operations being performed and the types involved in the operations. The code might not be handling the different types of operations correctly, leading to the TypeError being raised.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the types of the variables involved in the operations and handle them appropriately.
2. Ensure that the subtraction operation is well-defined for the types involved.
3. Handle the different cases for datetime, timedelta, and other numpy types separately.

Corrected Code:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        # ndarray[datetime64] cannot be subtracted from self, so
        # we need to wrap in DatetimeArray/Index and flip the operation
        if not isinstance(other, DatetimeLikeArrayMixin):
            # Avoid down-casting DatetimeIndex
            from pandas import DatetimeIndex

            other = DatetimeIndex(other)
        return other - self
    elif (
        is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype)
        and hasattr(other, "dtype")
        and not is_datetime64_any_dtype(other.dtype)
    ):
        # GH#19959 datetime - datetime is well-defined as timedelta,
        # but any other type - datetime is not well-defined.
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {cls} from {typ}".format(
                cls=type(other).__name__, typ=type(self).__name__
            )
        )
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype) and is_datetime64_any_dtype(other.dtype):
        # reversed subtraction, converting timedelta to datetime
        return other - self
    elif is_period_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other.dtype):
        # TODO: Can we simplify/generalize these cases at all?
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {cls} from {dtype}".format(
                cls=type(self).__name__, dtype=other.dtype
            )
        )
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if lib.is_integer(other) or is_integer_dtype(other):
            # need to subtract before negating, since that flips freq
            # -self flips self.freq, messing up results
            return -(self - other)
        return (-self) + other
    return -(self - other)
