The error occurs in the `__rsub__` method of the `DatetimeLikeArrayMixin` class. The error message indicates that the code is trying to create a `DatetimeArray` from the `other` variable, which is of type `numpy.datetime64`. This type conversion is causing the ValueError.

The issue is occurring because the `__rsub__` method is trying to create a `DatetimeArray` from the `other` variable without considering its type. This conversion should only be attempted when the `other` variable is not of type `numpy.datetime64`.

To fix the bug, the `__rsub__` method needs to be updated so that it doesn't try to create a `DatetimeArray` from a `numpy.datetime64` type. It should only perform this conversion when the `other` variable is not of type `numpy.datetime64`.

Below is the corrected code for the `__rsub__` method:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if not isinstance(other, DatetimeLikeArrayMixin):
            from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray

            other = DatetimeArray(other)
        return other - self
    elif (
        is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype)
        and hasattr(other, "dtype")
        and not is_datetime64_any_dtype(other.dtype)
    ):
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {cls} from {typ}".format(
                cls=type(self).__name__, typ=type(other).__name__
            )
        )
    elif is_period_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other):
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {cls} from {dtype}".format(
                cls=type(self).__name__, dtype=other.dtype
            )
        )
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if lib.is_integer(other) or is_integer_dtype(other):
            return -(self - other)
        return (-self) + other

    return -(self - other) if not isinstance(other, DatetimeArray) else NotImplemented
```

In the provided code, the main change is in the return statement at the end. It now conditionally returns `- (self - other)` only when `other` is not an instance of `DatetimeArray`. Otherwise, it returns `NotImplemented` to signal that the operation is not well-defined.

This fix ensures that the `DatetimeArray` is only created and used when it is appropriate, fixing the error caused by trying to convert a `numpy.datetime64` type inappropriately.
