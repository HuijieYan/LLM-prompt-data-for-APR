The potential error in the `__rsub__` method is in the line `if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):`. It seems that the condition may not be properly functioning as intended.

The bug occurs because the condition `is_datetime64_any_dtype(other)` is being checked first, and if it is true, the second condition `is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype)` is evaluated. However, the intention of this logic is to check both conditions independently, not as a combined condition.

To fix this bug, the conditions should be checked independently and appropriate actions should be taken based on the results of each condition.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other):
        if is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
            if not isinstance(other, DatetimeLikeArrayMixin):
                from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray
                other = DatetimeArray(other)
            return other - self
        elif is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype):
            raise TypeError(
                "cannot subtract {cls} from {typ}".format(
                    cls=type(self).__name__, typ=type(other).__name__
                )
            )
    elif is_period_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other.dtype):
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {cls} from {dtype}".format(
                cls=type(self).__name__, dtype=other.dtype
            )
        )
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if lib.is_integer(other) or is_integer_dtype(other):
            return -(self - other)
        return (-self) + other

    return -(self - other)
```
