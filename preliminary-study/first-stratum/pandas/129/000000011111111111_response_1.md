The error is occurring in the `__rsub__` method of the `DatetimeArray` class. The issue is that the `__rsub__` method is trying to create a `DatetimeArray` from the `other` variable, which is a numpy datetime64. This is causing a ValueError because the `DatetimeArray` class expects a different type.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `__rsub__` method to handle the numpy datetime64 type directly, rather than trying to convert it to a `DatetimeArray`. We can check for the type of `other` and perform the subtraction accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `__rsub__` method:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other):
        return self + (-other)
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        return self + (-other)
    elif is_datetime64_scalar(other):
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {cls} from {typ}".format(
                cls=type(self).__name__, typ=type(other).__name__
            )
        )
    elif is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype) and hasattr(other, "dtype") and not is_datetime64_any_dtype(other.dtype):
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {cls} from {typ}".format(
                cls=type(self).__name__, typ=type(other).__name__
            )
        )
    else:
        return -(self - other)
```

This modified method checks for the types of `self` and `other` and performs the subtraction based on the types. This should resolve the ValueError and the test case should pass without errors.
