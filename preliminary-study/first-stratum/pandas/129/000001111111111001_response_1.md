The error is occurring in the `__rsub__` method of the `DatetimeArray` class. It seems that the issue is related to the input parameter `other` being of type `datetime64`, but the code is expecting it to be a `DatetimeArray`. This mismatch is causing the function to raise a `ValueError`.

The reason for this bug is that the code expects `other` to be of type `DatetimeArray` and tries to convert it using `other = DatetimeArray(other)`. However, in the test case provided, `other` is of type `datetime64`, and this conversion is not happening as expected.

To fix this bug, the code needs to handle the case where `other` is of type `datetime64` and convert it to a `DatetimeArray` before performing the subtraction operation. This will ensure that the data types match and the subtraction can be performed properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `__rsub__` method:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        # ndarray[datetime64] cannot be subtracted from self, so
        # we need to wrap in DatetimeArray/Index and flip the operation
        if not isinstance(other, DatetimeLikeArrayMixin):
            from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray

            other = DatetimeArray(other)
        return other - self
    elif is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype) and hasattr(other, "dtype") and not is_datetime64_any_dtype(other.dtype):
        raise TypeError("cannot subtract {cls} from {typ}".format(cls=type(self).__name__, typ=type(other).__name__))
    elif is_period_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other):
        raise TypeError("cannot subtract {cls} from {dtype}".format(cls=type(self).__name__, dtype=other.dtype))
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if lib.is_integer(other) or is_integer_dtype(other):
            return -(self - other)
        return (-self) + other
    # Handle the case when `other` is of type `datetime64`
    elif is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype) and is_datetime64_any_dtype(other):
        from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray
        other = DatetimeArray(other)
        return other - self
    return -(self - other)
```

In the corrected code, I've added a new condition to handle the case when `other` is of type `datetime64`. If that's the case, it converts `other` to a `DatetimeArray` before performing the subtraction operation. This modification ensures that the data types match and the subtraction can be performed without any errors.
