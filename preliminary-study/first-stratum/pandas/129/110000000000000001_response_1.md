Potential error location: The potential error in the provided function is within the conditional statements and the operations performed inside each condition.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. The function is not properly handling the subtraction operations for different data types such as datetime, timedelta, and integer.
2. In some cases, the function is not properly handling the conversion of types, leading to errors.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Implement proper type conversion or error handling for different data types to ensure that the subtraction operations are well-defined for all cases.
2. Refactor the conditional statements and the operations within each condition to ensure correct and consistent behavior.

Corrected code:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        # ndarray[datetime64] cannot be subtracted from self, so
        # we need to wrap in DatetimeArray/Index and flip the operation
        if not isinstance(other, DatetimeLikeArrayMixin):
            # Avoid down-casting DatetimeIndex
            from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray

            other = DatetimeArray(other)
        return other - self
    elif (
        is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype)
        and hasattr(other, "dtype")
        and not is_datetime64_any_dtype(other.dtype)
    ):
        # GH#19959 datetime - datetime is well-defined as timedelta,
        # but any other type - datetime is not well-defined.
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {typ} from {cls}".format(
                cls=type(self).__name__, typ=type(other).__name__
            )
        )
    elif is_period_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other):
        # TODO: Can we simplify/generalize these cases at all?
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {dtype} from {cls}".format(
                cls=type(self).__name__, dtype=other.dtype
            )
        )
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if lib.is_integer(other) or is_integer_dtype(other):
            # need to subtract before negating, since that flips freq
            # -self flips self.freq, messing up results
            return self - other

        return self + (-other)

    return self - other
