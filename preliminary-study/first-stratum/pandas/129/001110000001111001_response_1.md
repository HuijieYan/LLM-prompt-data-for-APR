Potential error location: The buggy function is trying to handle various cases for subtracting different types of datetime-like arrays or values, but the logic seems to be convoluted and may not cover all possible scenarios.

Reasons behind the bug: The function has complex conditional branches to handle different data types and operations, which may not be covering all possible cases. This complexity can lead to incorrect results or errors.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Simplify the conditional logic to cover all possible cases in a more readable and maintainable way.
2. Consider using separate helper methods for different data type operations to improve readability and maintainability.
3. Add appropriate error handling for unhandled cases to provide informative error messages.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        # ndarray[datetime64] cannot be subtracted from self, so
        # we need to wrap in DatetimeArray/Index and flip the operation
        if not isinstance(other, (DatetimeArray, DatetimeIndex)):
            from pandas import DatetimeIndex  # Import DatetimeIndex for usage
    
            other = DatetimeIndex(other)
        return other - self
    elif is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype) and not is_datetime64_any_dtype(
        other.dtype
    ):
        # GH#19959 datetime - datetime is well-defined as timedelta,
        # but any other type - datetime is not well-defined.
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {typ} from {cls}".format(
                cls=type(self).__name__, typ=type(other).__name__
            )
        )
    elif is_period_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other):
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {dtype} from {cls}".format(
                cls=type(self).__name__, dtype=other.dtype
            )
        )
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if is_integer_dtype(other):
            return (-self) + other
        elif is_timedelta64_dtype(other):
            return (-self) + (-other)
    # Handle other cases or provide an appropriate error message
    raise TypeError(
        "Unsupported operation: cannot subtract {typ} from {cls}".format(
            cls=type(self).__name__, typ=type(other).__name__
        )
    )
```
In the corrected code, the conditional logic has been simplified and rewritten to cover different cases more clearly. Appropriate error handling has been added for unhandled scenarios.
