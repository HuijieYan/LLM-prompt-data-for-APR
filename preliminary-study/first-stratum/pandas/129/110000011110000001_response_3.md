The error occurs at the `__rsub__` method of the Pandas library, specifically in the `pandas/core/arrays/datetimelike.py` file. This error is a `ValueError` and is likely caused by an unexpected type passed to the `DatetimeArray` constructor. The `DatetimeArray` constructor expects the input to be a `DatetimeArray` ndarray, or Series or Index containing one of those. However, in this case, it appears that a `datetime64` type object is being passed, leading to the `ValueError`.

To fix this bug, the `DatetimeArray` constructor should be utilized correctly, ensuring that only acceptable inputs are passed to it.

The corrected function is provided below:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    import pandas as pd
    from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_datetime64_any_dtype
    from pandas.core.arrays.datetimelike import DatetimeLikeArrayMixin
    from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray

    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        # ndarray[datetime64] cannot be subtracted from self, so
        # we need to wrap in DatetimeArray/Index and flip the operation
        if not isinstance(other, DatetimeLikeArrayMixin):
            # Avoid down-casting DatetimeIndex
            other = DatetimeArray(other)
        return other - self
    elif (
        is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype)
        and hasattr(other, "dtype")
        and not is_datetime64_any_dtype(other.dtype)
    ):
        # GH#19959 datetime - datetime is well-defined as timedelta,
        # but any other type - datetime is not well-defined.
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {cls} from {typ}".format(
                cls=type(self).__name__, typ=type(other).__name__
            )
        )
    elif is_period_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other):
        # TODO: Can we simplify/generalize these cases at all?
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {cls} from {dtype}".format(
                cls=type(self).__name__, dtype=other.dtype
            )
        )
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype(other):
            # need to subtract before negating, since that flips freq
            # -self flips self.freq, messing up results
            return -(self - other)

        return (-self) + other

    return -(self - other)
```

In the corrected code, each condition for different data types has been handled appropriately. Additionally, the correct Pandas functions and methods have been imported for use within the function.
