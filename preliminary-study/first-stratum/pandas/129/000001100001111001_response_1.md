Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is within the first conditional statement that checks if the `other` parameter is of type `datetime64` and if `self.dtype` is of type `timedelta64`.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug is likely occurring because the operation `other - self` is attempting to subtract a `timedelta64` array from a `datetime64` array, which is not well-defined.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we can reverse the subtraction operation and return `self - other` instead of `other - self`.

Corrected Code:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        # ndarray[datetime64] cannot be subtracted from self, so
        # we need to reverse the operation
        return self - other
    elif (
        is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype)
        and hasattr(other, "dtype")
        and not is_datetime64_any_dtype(other.dtype)
    ):
        # GH#19959 datetime - datetime is well-defined as timedelta,
        # but any other type - datetime is not well-defined.
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {cls} from {typ}".format(
                cls=type(self).__name__, typ=type(other).__name__
            )
        )
    elif is_period_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other):
        # TODO: Can we simplify/generalize these cases at all?
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {cls} from {dtype}".format(
                cls=type(self).__name__, dtype=other.dtype
            )
        )
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if lib.is_integer(other) or is_integer_dtype(other):
            # need to subtract before negating, since that flips freq
            # -self flips self.freq, messing up results
            return -(self - other)

        return (-self) + other

    return -(self - other)
```
