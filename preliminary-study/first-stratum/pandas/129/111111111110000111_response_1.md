The error occurs in the `__rsub__` method of the `DatetimeLikeArrayMixin` class. A `ValueError` is being raised because the `DatetimeArray` is being initialized with an unexpected type 'datetime64'. This is happening due to the line `other = DatetimeArray(other)` within the `__rsub__` method.

The reason behind this bug is that the `DatetimeArray` class is expecting the input `values` to be a DatetimeArray ndarray, or Series or Index containing one of those. However, in this case, it seems to be receiving a numpy.datetime64 type as input, which is causing the ValueError to be raised.

To fix this bug, we need to make sure that the `DatetimeArray` class receives the expected input type. This can be achieved by modifying the logic to handle the unexpected input type 'datetime64' and either handle it appropriately or raise a more informative error message.

Below is the corrected code for the `__rsub__` method of the `DatetimeLikeArrayMixin` class:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        # ndarray[datetime64] cannot be subtracted from self, so
        # we need to wrap in DatetimeArray/Index and flip the operation
        if not isinstance(other, (DatetimeArray, np.ndarray)):
            other = np.array([other], dtype='datetime64[ns]')
        return other - self
    elif (
        is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype)
        and hasattr(other, "dtype")
        and not is_datetime64_any_dtype(other.dtype)
    ):
        # GH#19959 datetime - datetime is well-defined as timedelta,
        # but any other type - datetime is not well-defined.
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {cls} from {typ}".format(
                cls=type(self).__name__, typ=type(other).__name__
            )
        )
    elif is_period_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other):
        # TODO: Can we simplify/generalize these cases at all?
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {cls} from {dtype}".format(
                cls=type(self).__name__, dtype=other.dtype
            )
        )
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if lib.is_integer(other) or is_integer_dtype(other):
            # need to subtract before negating, since that flips freq
            # -self flips self.freq, messing up results
            return -(self - other)

        return (-self) + other

    return -(self - other)
```
By adding the check `if not isinstance(other, (DatetimeArray, np.ndarray)):` and handling the unexpected input type 'datetime64', we can avoid raising the ValueError and address the bug in the `__rsub__` method.
