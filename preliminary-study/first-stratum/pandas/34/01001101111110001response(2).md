The test case `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` is related to the error message about ambiguous time. This is likely caused by inappropriate handling of daylight saving time (DST) transitions in the `TimeGrouper` class.

The potential error location within the `buggy` function is in the manipulation of time values, especially when dealing with DST transitions. The error message indicates that the function is unable to infer the DST time, suggesting a problem with how the function handles ambiguous time.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle DST transitions properly, leading to ambiguous times that cannot be inferred.

To fix the bug, the function should utilize proper methods for handling DST transitions in the time calculations, such as using appropriate timezone conversions and adjusting for the ambiguous times.

Here's the corrected code for the `buggy` function:

```python
from pandas import Timestamp, date_range, DataFrame
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

class TimeGrouper:
    # ... other methods ...
    
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
    
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = pd.DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
    
        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )
        
        # Use resample to correctly handle ambiguous times
        result = ax.tz_localize(None).resample(self.freq, closed=self.closed, label=self.label).mean()
        
        binner = result.index
        bin_edges = np.concatenate((result.index, [result.index[-1] + self.freq]))
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax)
        
        bins = np.digitize(ax, bin_edges, right=self.closed == 'right')
        labels = binner[bins - 1]
        
        return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code, the function uses the `resample` method to handle ambiguous times caused by DST transitions. The function avoids direct manipulation of time values and focuses on leveraging Pandas' built-in functionality for handling time series data, which ensures accurate and consistent handling of DST transitions.
