The error occurs when trying to apply the `groupby` method on a DataFrame using a daily frequency on a day with a clock change in the 'America/Havana' timezone. This raises an `AmbiguousTimeError` because midnight local time on the clock change day is an ambiguous timestamp.

The issue is likely in the `_get_time_bins` method within the `TimeGrouper` class. Specifically, the problem may be related to how the time bins and labels are generated.

To fix this bug, the `TimeGrouper` class needs to handle ambiguous time in the timezone specified. This may involve ensuring that ambiguous times are handled correctly when generating the time bins and labels.

The corrected code is provided below:

```python
from pandas.core.indexes.datetimes import DatetimeIndex

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )
    
    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin may be slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = ax.to_period(self.freq).to_timestamp()

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(ax) < len(binner):
        labels = labels[: len(ax)]

    return binner, [], labels
```

This code revision includes changes to the way time bins and labels are generated to handle ambiguous times when using the `TimeGrouper` with daily frequency in timezones with daylight saving time changes.
