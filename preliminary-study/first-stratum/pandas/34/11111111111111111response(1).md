The test case `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` is trying to downsample the data into daily frequency, and it is encountering an `AmbiguousTimeError` related to the ambiguous timestamps on the date of the clock change in Cuba.

The problematic function causing this error is the `_get_time_bins` function in the `TimeGrouper` class. This function is responsible for grouping the data based on time intervals, and it is not handling the ambiguous timestamps correctly, leading to the error.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the function does not account for the ambiguous timestamps that occur during the transition to daylight saving time, causing the `AmbiguousTimeError` when trying to group the data.

To fix the bug, the `_get_time_bins` function should be updated to handle ambiguous timestamps in a way that ensures the grouping of data into time bins is done accurately, even during transitions involving ambiguous times.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Convert the DatetimeIndex to UTC to avoid ambiguous time errors
    ax_utc = ax.tz_convert('UTC')
    
    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax_utc.min(), ax_utc.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax_utc.tz,  # Use the original time zone
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward"
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected code, the `ax` is converted to UTC to avoid ambiguous time errors, and then the rest of the computation is carried out based on the adjusted time index.

With this fix, the `_get_time_bins` function should be able to handle the ambiguous timestamps during the transition to daylight saving time and avoid the `AmbiguousTimeError` when grouping the data.
