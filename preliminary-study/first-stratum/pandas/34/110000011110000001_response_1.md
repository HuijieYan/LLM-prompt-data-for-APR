The test case `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` is trying to downsample a time series data frame by averaging the values for each day. However, it encounters an `AmbiguousTimeError` due to ambiguous time zone conversion during the resampling process.

The potential error location within the `_get_time_bins` function is the handling of timezone localization and conversion. The bug may be occurring when attempting to create date bins with ambiguous time zones, which leads to the error mentioned in the error message.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the current implementation of `_get_time_bins` does not handle ambiguous time zones properly, resulting in the `AmbiguousTimeError` during the resampling process.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that timezone localization and conversion are handled properly when creating date bins. This can involve explicitly handling ambiguous times and providing a strategy for resolving them.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    # Ensure proper handling of ambiguous times during timezone conversion
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
}
```

In the corrected function, the `_get_time_bins` function ensures that timezone localization and conversion are handled properly when creating date bins. The `ambiguous` argument in the `date_range` function is set to "infer" to handle ambiguous times during timezone conversion, which can help prevent the occurrence of the `AmbiguousTimeError` during the resampling process.
