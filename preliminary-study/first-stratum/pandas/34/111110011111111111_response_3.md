The error is occurring in the `_get_time_bins` method of the `TimeGrouper` class. The method is failing to handle the ambiguous timestamps that occur due to a clock change in certain timezones. This is leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError` when the `groupby` method is called in the test function.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_get_time_bins` method to handle ambiguous timestamps appropriately. One approach to handle this is to use the `ambiguous` parameter in the `date_range` function to infer ambiguous times, and pass `nonexistent="shift_forward"` parameter to handle nonexistent times. This will ensure that the timestamps are handled correctly, and the `groupby` method won't raise an `AmbiguousTimeError` anymore.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` method:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    # existing code

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    # existing code

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # existing code
```

With this correction, the `AmbiguousTimeError` should be resolved, and the test case should pass without any errors.
