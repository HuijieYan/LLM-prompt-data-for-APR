The issue seems to be related to how the time bins are being grouped and labeled. The error message "Cannot infer dst time from 2018-11-04 00:00:00 as there are no repeated times" indicates a problem with inferring Daylight Saving Time (DST) during time grouping.

The bug is likely to be occurring when the function `_get_time_bins` is creating the time bins and the associated labels. The DST transition at midnight on November 4th, 2018 might be causing an ambiguous time error due to incorrect labeling or bin creation. The error occurs because it is trying to infer the DST time from the given date but fails due to a lack of repeated times.

To solve this issue, the bin and label creation process should be reviewed and adjusted based on DST transitions. It's important to consider whether the functions involved in generating and labeling the bins are correctly handling DST transitions.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function `_get_time_bins`:

```python
from pandas.core.indexes.datetimes import DatetimeIndex
import pandas._libs.tslibs.validation as validation

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    tz = ax.tz  # Get timezone from ax
    ambiguous = "infer"
    nonexistent = "shift_forward"
    tz_parts = tz.zone.split('/')
    if len(tz_parts) == 2 and tz_parts[0] in validation.ZONES and tz_parts[1] in validation.ZONES[tz_parts[0]]['countries']:
        ambiguous = 'NaT'
        nonexistent = 'shift_backward'

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    bins = validation.generate_bins_maybe_with_take_ambig(
        ax.asi8, self.closed,
        freq=self.freq, start=first, end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        ambiguous=ambiguous,
        nonexistent=nonexistent,
        closed=self.closed
    )

    if self.label == 'left':
        labels = bins[1:]  # Remove the first element from bins
    else:
        labels = bins

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = bins.copy()
        labels = bins.copy()

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code, the `ambiguous` and `nonexistent` variables are adjusted based on the timezone to handle DST transitions correctly. The function `generate_bins_maybe_with_take_ambig` is used to handle ambiguous time-based bin generation and labeling, taking into account DST transitions and time zone changes. Additionally, appropriate checks and copying of bins and labels are performed for cases where `ax` contains NaN values.
