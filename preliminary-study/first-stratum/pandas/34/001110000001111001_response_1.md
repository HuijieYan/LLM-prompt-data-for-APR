Potential error location: The bug may be related to the construction of the `binner`, `labels`, `ax_values`, `bin_edges`, and `bins` variables. It could be caused by incorrect manipulation and assignment of these variables within the function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug may be due to incorrect variable assignment or manipulation, resulting in unexpected behavior and possibly incorrect output.

Approach for fixing the bug:
1. Check the logic for constructing `binner`, `labels`, `ax_values`, `bin_edges`, and `bins` variables to ensure that they are being generated correctly.
2. Verify any conditional statements involving the `binner`, `labels`, and other related variables to ensure they are being handled appropriately.
3. Ensure that the data types and shapes of the variables are being used consistently and appropriately throughout the function.

#### Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # General version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # If we end up with more labels than bins, adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
The corrected code includes validations for the construction of `binner`, `labels`, `ax_values`, `bin_edges`, and `bins` variables and ensures their appropriate manipulation and assignment within the function. This should address any potential issues related to the bug.
