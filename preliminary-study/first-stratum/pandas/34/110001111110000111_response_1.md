The error message "Cannot infer dst time from 2018-11-04 00:00:00 as there are no repeated times" indicates that the program is unable to handle the ambiguous timestamp for the midnight local time on the 4th of November, 2018 during a clock change in Cuba.

The bug seems to be located in the `_get_time_bins` function, particularly in the part where the labels are handled. When there are repeated times due to a clock change, the code should be able to handle this ambiguity, but it is currently failing to do so.

The reason behind the bug is that the code is not considering the potential for ambiguous timestamps that occur during a clock change, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError.

To fix the bug, the code needs to handle the ambiguous timestamps more effectively. One possible approach is to check for ambiguous times and handle them appropriately by incorporating logic to identify and label the repeated times. This can be achieved using the `ambiguous` parameter in the `date_range` function.

The corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function is as follows:

```python
from pandas import DatetimeIndex, date_range, NaT

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels
    
    first, last = ax.min(), ax.max()

    binner, labels = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        closed=self.closed,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward"
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code accounts for the handling of ambiguous times through the use of the `ambiguous="infer"` parameter in the `date_range` function. This change allows the code to appropriately handle the ambiguous timestamp during the clock change in Cuba, addressing the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
