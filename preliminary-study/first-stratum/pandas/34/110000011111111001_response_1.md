The test case `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` involves creating a DataFrame with hourly time frequency data and then grouping it with a frequency of 1 day. The error message indicates an "AmbiguousTimeError" related to daylight saving time (DST) at midnight.

The error appears to occur within the `_get_time_bins` method of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas` library. One of the root causes of the bug is that the method does not handle DST transitions properly.

To fix this bug, we need to address how DST transitions are handled when binning the time values. Specifically, when creating the `binner` and `labels` using the `date_range` function, it's crucial to consider the ambiguity associated with DST transitions.

The `tz` parameter specifies the time zone for `binner` and `labels`. To handle ambiguous times, the `ambiguous` parameter must be set to an appropriate value. In this case, it should be set to "NaT" (Not a Time) to indicate that there is ambiguity between standard time and daylight saving time.

We also need to ensure that the time values are localized properly, considering the potential ambiguity during DST transitions.

The corrected `_get_time_bins` method is as follows:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # Ensure that time values are localized properly, considering potential DST transitions
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first.tz_localize(ax.tz, ambiguous="NaT"),
        end=last.tz_localize(ax.tz, ambiguous="NaT"),
        name=ax.name
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code, we ensure that the time values are localized properly using the `tz_localize` method and handle the ambiguity during DST transitions by setting the `ambiguous` parameter appropriately. This should address the "AmbiguousTimeError" encountered in the test case.
