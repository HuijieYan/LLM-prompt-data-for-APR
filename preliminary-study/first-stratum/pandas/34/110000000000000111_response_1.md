The issue mentioned is related to the handling of ambiguous time, particularly when there is a clock change in Cuba. The error occurs when trying to group data by day using the `pd.Grouper` with a daily frequency.

Looking at the function `_get_time_bins`, it seems the potential error location could be in the handling of timestamps and binning them based on frequency.

The error occurs because the function doesn't handle ambiguous times properly, especially when there is a clock change, as in the case of Cuba. This results in an AmbiguousTimeError when trying to group the data by day.

To fix this issue, the `_get_time_bins` function should be modified to properly handle ambiguous times. This can be achieved by using the `tz_localize` and `tz_convert` functions to explicitly handle timezones and any ambiguity that arises due to time changes.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
# Corrected function
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz_localize(None).tz_convert(None),  # Handle timezone conversion
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
In the corrected function, the handling of timezones and ambiguity is explicitly addressed using the `tz_localize` and `tz_convert` functions. This should mitigate the AmbiguousTimeError when grouping the data by day.
