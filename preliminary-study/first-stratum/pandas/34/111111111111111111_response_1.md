The error occurs when the `groupby` method is called with a daily frequency, and it fails with an `AmbiguousTimeError` on a clock change day in Cuba. This is due to the fact that on a long clock-change day in Cuba, such as November 4th, midnight local time is an ambiguous timestamp, and the `pd.Grouper` does not handle this situation correctly.

To fix this issue, the `_get_time_bins` function in the `TimeGrouper` class needs to be corrected. The problem lies in the calculation of `binner` and `bin_edges` and their adjustment, which leads to the improper handling of DST transitions in certain timezones.

The corrected approach involves making adjustments for the handling of DST transitions and resolving the ambiguity in timestamps. This can be achieved by utilizing an inherent functionality provided by pandas for dealing with timezone conversions and adjustments during DST transitions.

Given the nature of the issue, a more complex solution is required to handle the cases where timestamps are ambiguous due to DST transitions.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Adjusting timezone and handling DST transitions
    ax = ax.tz_convert('UTC')

    binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=ax.min(),
            end=ax.max(),
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # General version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # If we end up with more labels than bins, adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With these corrections, the `_get_time_bins` function will now take into account the timezone conversions and handle DST transitions correctly, which should resolve the issue with the `AmbiguousTimeError` and allow the `groupby` with daily frequency to work correctly on clock change days in Cuba.
