Potential error location: The error is most likely occurring in the `_get_time_bins` method within the `TimeGrouper` class. The error is raised when the method is checking if the input `ax` is an instance of `DatetimeIndex`.

Reason for the bug: The bug appears to be due to the fact that the check for `DatetimeIndex` is failing, which is then raising a `TypeError`. This may be due to incorrect data being passed to the method or a problem with the logic for checking the type of `ax`.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: The correct approach for fixing the bug would involve ensuring that the input `ax` is indeed a `DatetimeIndex` before proceeding with the logic of the `_get_time_bins` method. This could involve improving the type checking and handling invalid input properly.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex):
        raise ValueError("axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got an instance of {}".format(type(ax).__name__))

    # Rest of the method's logic
```
In the corrected code, we have replaced the `TypeError` with `ValueError` to follow best practices for raising exceptions and improved the error message to provide more information about the error. Additionally, the type checking has been corrected to use `pd.DatetimeIndex` instead of just `DatetimeIndex`.
