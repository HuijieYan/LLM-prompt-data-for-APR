The issue seems to be related to the handling of ambiguous timestamps, specifically on a long clock-change day in Cuba. The code is failing to handle this situation, thus leading to an AmbiguousTimeError.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the calculation of `first` and `last` timestamps. These timestamps are used to generate bins for grouping the data, and when ambiguous time on the clock-change day is encountered, it leads to the error.

The bug is occurring because the code does not handle ambiguous timestamps caused by the clock change in a timezone such as Cuba's. When the `date_range` function is called to generate bins between `first` and `last`, it does not handle the ambiguous timestamp appropriately, which leads to the error further down in the code.

To fix this bug, the code needs to handle ambiguous times caused by the clock change. This can be achieved using the proper handling of timezone transitions and ambiguous times. One approach for this is to use the `infer` parameter in `date_range` to handle ambiguous times appropriately. Additionally, using the `normalize` parameter in `date_range` may also help in dealing with the timestamp range edges when encountering ambiguous times.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max()

    binner = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        ambiguous="infer",
        name=ax.name,
        closed=self.closed,
        normalize=True  # Handle ambiguous times
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected code, when creating the `binner`, the `ambiguous` and `normalize` parameters are used to handle ambiguous times appropriately. This should address the issue of failing on a long clock-change day in Cuba.
