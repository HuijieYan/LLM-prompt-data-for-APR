The error occurs when the `pd.Grouper` attempts to group the data in the presence of an ambiguous timestamp arising from a clock change on a specific day. This causes `pd.Grouper` to raise an `AmbiguousTimeError`. The bug is likely located in the `_get_time_bins` and `_get_timestamp_range_edges` methods, as they're related to the generation of time bins and dealing with timestamp ranges.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to handle the ambiguous timestamp scenario explicitly. This could involve identifying ambiguous time ranges and handling them appropriately, potentially by adjusting the timestamp range edges to prevent the creation of ambiguous time slots. Another approach could be to provide a flag to the `pd.Grouper` to handle ambiguous times in a customizable way, allowing users to specify their preferred behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError("axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got an instance of {type(ax).__name__}")

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = self._get_timestamp_range_edges(ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base)
    
    # New logic to handle ambiguous times
    if first.tzinfo._isdst != last.tzinfo._isdst:
        first += pd.Timedelta(hours=1)
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward"
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # General version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # If we end up with more labels than bins, adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code introduces a new logic to handle ambiguous times by checking the DST status of two consecutive days and adding a time offset to `first` if necessary.

It's important to note that handling ambiguous times within the `_get_time_bins` function may not be the most comprehensive approach. It might be necessary to handle the ambiguous times at a higher level or to introduce a new parameter to allow users to specify the behavior for ambiguous times.
