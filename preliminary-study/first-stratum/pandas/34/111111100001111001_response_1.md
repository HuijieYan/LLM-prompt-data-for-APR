The error occurs because the code tries to call methods on ax.min() and ax.max() as if they were datetime objects, but they are actually methods. Additionally, the code uses date_range without importing it, and there are variables that are used without being defined.

To fix this, we need to import the date_range function and call the methods ax.min and ax.max explicitly. We also need to define the variables used in the function.

```python
from pandas import DatetimeIndex, date_range, NaT
import numpy as np

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max()
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    bin_edges = np.array([first, last])  # Example bin edges
    bins = np.digitize(ax_values, bin_edges)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    has_nans = False  # Example value, should be determined based on input data
    if has_nans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

Note that bin_edges, bins, and has_nans are example values and need to be determined based on the actual input data. It's also important to handle the binning process appropriately based on the specific requirements of the application.
