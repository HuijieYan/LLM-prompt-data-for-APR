The error message indicates that an `AmbiguousTimeError` is being raised when trying to infer the daylight saving time from a specific timestamp, resulting in no repeated times being found.

The bug is likely located in the `_get_time_bins` function, specifically within the `date_range` call. This is because the error message points to an issue related to time ambiguity, which is a common problem when dealing with daylight saving time transitions.

The reason for the error is that the `date_range` function is not handling ambiguous times properly, leading to the inference of daylight saving time being unsuccessful in cases where there are no repeated times.

To fix the bug, the `tz` parameter in the `date_range` call should be set to `None` to avoid localizing to a specific time zone, which can cause ambiguity in certain cases.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        ambiguous="infer",
        tz=None,  # Set the timezone parameter to None
        name=ax.name,
        closed=self.closed
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # ... omitted code ...

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By setting the `tz` parameter to `None` in the `date_range` function, the ambiguity related to daylight saving time transitions should be resolved.
