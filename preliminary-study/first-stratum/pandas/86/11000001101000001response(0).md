The issue with the provided function seems to be that it is expecting the 'columns' parameter to always be present, even though it is not required if 'values' is given and 'index' is not None. This is causing the function to crash when 'index' is given but 'columns' is not.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to handle the case when 'columns' is None and 'values' is not None and 'index' is not None.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def pivot(data: "DataFrame", index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> "DataFrame":
    if index is not None and columns is None and values is not None:
        columns = data.columns.difference([index, values])

    if values is None:
        cols = [columns] if index is None else [index, columns]
        append = index is None
        indexed = data.set_index(cols, append=append)
    else:
        if index is None:
            index = data.index
        else:
            index = data[index]
        index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])

        if is_list_like(values) and not isinstance(values, tuple):
            # Exclude tuple because it is seen as a single column name
            indexed = data._constructor(
                data[values].values, index=index, columns=values
            )
        else:
            indexed = data._constructor_sliced(data[values].values, index=index)
    return indexed.unstack(columns)
```

With this modification, the function will now handle the case when 'columns' is None and 'values' is not None and 'index' is not None. This should fix the bug where the function was crashing in this scenario.
