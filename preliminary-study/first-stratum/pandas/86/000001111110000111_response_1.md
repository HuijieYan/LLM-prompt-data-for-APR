The error message indicates that the key 'None' is not in the columns, which suggests that the 'columns' variable is being passed as None and is causing the KeyError.

Upon analyzing the code, the potential error location is identified within the pivot function where it checks if the 'values' variable is None. If it is None, the 'cols' variable is being assigned a list containing the 'columns' variable. However, 'columns' may also be None in this case, leading to the error.

The bug occurs because the code does not handle the case where 'columns' is None, as it is not allowed to be None according to the pandas documentation. 

The possible approach for fixing the bug is to explicitly check if 'columns' is None and raise an error if it is, to match the documentation.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def pivot(data: "DataFrame", index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> "DataFrame":
    if columns is None:
        raise ValueError("The 'columns' parameter is required for pivot operation.")
    
    if values is None:
        cols = [columns] if index is None else [index, columns]
        append = index is None
        indexed = data.set_index(cols, append=append)
    else:
        if index is None:
            index = data.index
        else:
            index = data[index]
        index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])

        if is_list_like(values) and not isinstance(values, tuple):
            # Exclude tuple because it is seen as a single column name
            indexed = data._constructor(
                data[values].values, index=index, columns=values
            )
        else:
            indexed = data._constructor_sliced(data[values].values, index=index)
    return indexed.unstack(columns)
```
