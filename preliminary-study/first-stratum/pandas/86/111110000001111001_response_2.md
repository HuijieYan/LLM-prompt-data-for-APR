The potential error in the code is with the use of 'index' and 'columns' variables in the function. It seems that the function is trying to pivot the DataFrame, but there are some issues with how 'index' and 'columns' are being used.

The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of 'index' and 'columns'. The function tries to set 'index' and 'columns' in a way that causes issues when pivoting the DataFrame.

To fix the bug, we can use the pandas.pivot_table function, which is specifically designed for pivoting DataFrames. We can use this function to pivot the data based on the provided 'index', 'columns', and 'values' parameters.

Here's the corrected code using the pandas.pivot_table function:

```python
# Corrected function
def pivot(data: "DataFrame", index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> "DataFrame":
    if values is None:
        pivoted = pd.pivot_table(data, index=index, columns=columns)
    else:
        pivoted = pd.pivot_table(data, index=index, columns=columns, values=values)
    return pivoted
```

In the corrected code, we use the pandas.pivot_table function to pivot the DataFrame based on the provided parameters. This ensures that the pivot operation is performed correctly, addressing the issues present in the original code.
