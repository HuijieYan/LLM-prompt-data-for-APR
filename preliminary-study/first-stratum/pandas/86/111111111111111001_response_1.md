The error message indicates a KeyError being raised in the `pandas._libs.index.IndexEngine.get_loc` method, which is called from the `pandas/core/reshape/pivot.py` file. The `get_loc` method is involved in retrieving the location of a given key within an index.

The bug in the provided function likely arises from the line:
```python
index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])
```
This line is attempting to create a `MultiIndex`, but it may not be handling the input `index` and `columns` correctly, leading to the KeyError when attempting to retrieve a location.

The bug is likely occurring due to how the `index` and `columns` are being used to create the `MultiIndex`. It's possible that the function is not handling the inputs properly, leading to unexpected behavior when retrieving values from the index.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to ensure that the `index` and `columns` are properly used to create the `MultiIndex` and that they are appropriately aligned with the input data.

Here's the corrected code for the `pivot` function:

```python
from pandas import DataFrame, MultiIndex

def pivot(data: DataFrame, index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> DataFrame:
    if values is None:
        cols = [columns] if index is None else [index, columns]
        append = index is None
        indexed = data.set_index(cols, append=append)
    else:
        if index is None:
            index = data.index
        else:
            index = data[index]
        index = MultiIndex.from_product([index, data[columns]])

        if is_list_like(values) and not isinstance(values, tuple):
            # Exclude tuple because it is seen as a single column name
            indexed = data._constructor(
                data[values].values, index=index, columns=values
            )
        else:
            indexed = data._constructor_sliced(data[values].values, index=index)
    return indexed.unstack(columns)
```

In the corrected code, the `MultiIndex` is being created using `MultiIndex.from_product` to properly handle the input `index` and `columns` and ensure that they are aligned with the input data. This should address the issues with the original implementation and prevent the KeyError from occurring.
