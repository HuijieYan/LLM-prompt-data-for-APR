Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `_cython_agg_blocks`:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
        if numeric_only:
            data = data.convert_dtypes()
            data = data.select_dtypes(include=['number'])

        if isinstance(data, DataFrame):
            agg_data = data._cython_agg_general(
                how, alt=alt, numeric_only=numeric_only, min_count=min_count
            )
        else:
            agg_data = data._cython_agg_general(
                how, alt=alt, min_count=min_count
            )

        agg_blocks = [make_block(result, location=slicer) for result, slicer in agg_data]

        return agg_blocks, data.items
```

In the corrected code:
1. We first convert the data to dedicated dtypes using `data.convert_dtypes()` and select only columns with numeric dtypes using `data.select_dtypes(include=['number'])`.
2. We then call the `_cython_agg_general` method on the modified data to perform the aggregation operation.
3. We create blocks with the aggregated results using the `make_block` function.
4. Finally, we return the aggregated blocks and the data items.

This approach ensures that the aggregation operations are performed correctly on DataFrameGroupBy objects containing columns with 'Int64' data type.
