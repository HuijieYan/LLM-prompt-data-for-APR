The issue seems to be related to calling the mean function on a DataFrameGroupBy object with the Int64 dtype. This results in a TypeError.

The potential error location within the function is the handling of the dtype when calling the aggregate function on the grouper.

The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle the special case of nullable integer data type (Int64). When calling aggregate functions such as mean, median, or std on a DataFrameGroupBy with the nullable integer data type, it results in a TypeError.

To fix the bug, the function should include a check for the data type and handle the nullable integer data type differently when calling aggregate functions.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... existing code here ...

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    # Check for nullable integer data type
    if data._typ == "Int64":
        data = data.dropna()

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    # ... existing code here ...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected code, a check for the nullable integer data type is included, and the data is handled differently for this case. This approach should address the bug and handle the nullable integer data type when calling aggregate functions on a DataFrameGroupBy.
