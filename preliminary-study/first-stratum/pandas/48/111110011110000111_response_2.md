The error is occurring when calling the `mean` function after grouping a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype columns. The error message indicates that there is a problem casting an array from dtype `float64` to dtype `int64` according to the rule 'safe'.

The issue is likely to be within the `_cython_agg_blocks` method of the DataFrameGroupBy class. The error message points to an issue with casting from `float64` to `int64`.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that the types of the data being cast are compatible. In this case, it seems that the typecasting to `int64` is failing when the original data type is `float64`, resulting in the TypeError.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` method of the DataFrameGroupBy class:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    
    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = block.values

        if not is_numeric_dtype(result.dtype):
            # Handle dynamically typed columns
            result = result.astype('float64')

        result = result.mean()

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    return agg_blocks, data.items
```

In this corrected code, the data type compatibility issue is handled by casting the data to `float64` before calling the `mean` function. This ensures that the calculation is performed on a compatible data type and should resolve the TypeError when calling the `mean` function on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype columns.
