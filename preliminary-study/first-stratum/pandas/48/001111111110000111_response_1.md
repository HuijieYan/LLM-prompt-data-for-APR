The error is occurring in the `safe_cast` function when it tries to cast a float64 array to an int64 array. The issue arises from the fact that the `dtype` is specified as 'Int64' when creating the DataFrame, indicating a nullable integer data type. When calling the `mean` function on a DataFrameGroupBy with a nullable integer dtype, a TypeError is raised.

The issue occurs because the implementation of the `safe_cast` function does not handle the conversion from float64 to int64 properly when dealing with nullable integers.

As a potential fix, a check can be added to the `safe_cast` function to specifically handle the conversion from float64 to int64 when dealing with nullable integers. If the values are non-equivalent, a proper error message should be raised to indicate that the conversion is not safe.

Here is the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... omitted code ...

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # ... omitted code ...

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    if split_items:
        # ... omitted code ...

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        # ... omitted code ...

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By making appropriate adjustments in the `safe_cast` function and ensuring that conversions from float64 to int64 are handled properly when dealing with nullable integers, the TypeError should be resolved when calling the `mean` function on a DataFrameGroupBy with a nullable integer dtype.
