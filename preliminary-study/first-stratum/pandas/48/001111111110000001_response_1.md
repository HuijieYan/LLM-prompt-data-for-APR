The error message indicates that there is an issue with converting float values to integer values. This is likely related to the way the DataFrameGroupBy's `aggregate` method is processing the data.

Looking at the `DataFrameGroupBy` class and the `aggregate` method, it seems that the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is responsible for processing the data and may be causing the issue.

The error occurs because the `safe_cast` function is trying to convert float values to integer values, but these are not equivalent, leading to a `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, we can modify the way the values are handled in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. It seems that the function is dealing with numeric data, so we need to ensure that the appropriate data type, either float or int, is used consistently.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
# ...
    def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        # ... previous code unchanged ...

        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
            data = data.astype(float)  # Ensuring that all numeric data is treated as floats

        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        # Some object-dtype blocks might be split into List[Block[T], Block[U]]
        split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []
        # ... remaining code unchanged ...
    
        return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By explicitly converting the numeric data to float values, we ensure that there won't be any mismatch when casting the values, potentially resolving the TypeError issue.

This code change should help address the error by ensuring consistent treatment of data types, preventing the need for conversion from float to integer and vice versa.
