The bug seems to be related to how the mean, median, and std functions are being called on a DataFrameGroupBy with the Int64 dtype. These functions are resulting in a TypeError.

The error seems to be occurring in the `_cython_agg_blocks` method of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class.

The bug occurs because the DataFrameGroupBy object is being created with the Int64 dtype for the 'b' column. When mean, median, or std is called on a DataFrameGroupBy with the Int64 dtype, it results in a TypeError.

To fix the bug, the code should be modified to handle the case when the DataFrameGroupBy object has a column with the Int64 dtype, and the mean, median, or std functions are called on it.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` method:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    ...
    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
        
    if isinstance(data, DataFrame):
        for col in data.columns:
            if data[col].dtype == 'Int64':
                data[col] = data[col].astype(float)
    
    ...
```

In this corrected code, we are first checking if the data is a DataFrame, and if so, we are converting any columns with the Int64 dtype to float before performing the aggregation.

This fix should resolve the TypeError issue when calling mean, median, or std on a DataFrameGroupBy with the Int64 dtype.
