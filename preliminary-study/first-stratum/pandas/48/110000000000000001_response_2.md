The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the try-except block where it catches NotImplementedError. It seems that if alt is not None, the code might not handle the result correctly, leading to an unexpected behavior.

The bug occurs because the code does not handle the alternate aggregation method (alt) properly when an exception is caught. This could lead to incorrect aggregation or unexpected behavior when alt is provided.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the result from the alternate aggregation method (alt) is handled correctly and consistently.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> Tuple[List[pd.Block], pd.Index]:
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: pd.BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[pd.Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is not None:
                obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]

                if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                    obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

                s = obj.groupby(self.grouper, axis=1)

                try:
                    # Call the alternate aggregation method (alt)
                    result = s.aggregate(alt)
                except TypeError:
                    deleted_items.append(locs)
                    continue

                result = result.select_dtypes(include=[np.number])

        if result is not no_result:
            result = result.apply(pd.to_numeric, errors="ignore")
            agg_block = pd.Block(result.values, result.index, result.columns)

            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise pd.DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our
    # current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected code, we handle alternate aggregation method (alt) by using object grouping and then applying the alternate aggregation method using the `aggregate` method of the group. Any type errors are caught, and the corrupted blocks are excluded. The result is then cast to numeric using `pd.to_numeric`. If no alternate method is provided, the original aggregation method is used. Finally, the resulting aggregation blocks and items are returned.
