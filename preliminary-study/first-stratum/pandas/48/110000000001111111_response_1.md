The bug is likely occurring in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function due to the handling of nullable integer data types during the aggregation process. The function is likely not able to handle the `Int64` dtype when aggregating using the `mean`, `median`, and `std` methods after grouping.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to handle nullable integer data types properly during aggregation. This may involve explicitly converting the nullable integer data type to a regular integer data type before performing the aggregation.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        if isinstance(block.values, pd.arrays.IntegerArray):
            block.values = block.values.astype('int64')

        # perform aggregation
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        # create a new Block with the aggregated result
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # rest of the code remains the same

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected code, we explicitly check if the block values are of type `pd.arrays.IntegerArray`, and if so, we convert the values to the regular `int64` dtype before performing the aggregation. This should address the issue with handling nullable integer data types during aggregation.
