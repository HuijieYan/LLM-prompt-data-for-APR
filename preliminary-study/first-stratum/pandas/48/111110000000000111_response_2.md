The error is occurring when calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with Int64 dtype. This results in a TypeError. The error does not occur when calling other functions such as `min`, `max`, or `first`, but does occur with `median` and `std`.

The problematic function seems to be `_cython_agg_blocks`. The issue might be related to how the function handles numeric data, specifically Int64 dtype after performing a groupby operation.

One possible approach to fixing the bug could be to modify how the function handles the dtype conversion for Int64 data. It's possible that the dtype conversion is not being handled correctly when calling specific aggregation methods like `mean`, `median`, and `std` on Int64 data.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        # Change how numeric data is extracted
        data = data._consolidate(data._can_coerce_index)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
``` 

Please note that this change is just one possible approach to fixing the bug. It's important to thoroughly test the modified function with various input scenarios to ensure that it handles Int64 data correctly after a groupby operation.
