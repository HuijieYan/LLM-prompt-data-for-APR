The issue here is that the function is trying to cast floating-point values to integers, which is not allowable.

The error occurs in the function `_cython_agg_blocks` of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class. It is likely occurring when trying to cast the floating-point values to integers in the `_from_sequence` method call.

The reason for the error is that the original code tries to cast float64 to int64 when calculating the mean or other function operations, which is not allowed and results in a TypeError.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the nullable integer (Int64) type data is handled correctly when performing aggregation operations. The Int64 dtype should be treated as a floating-point dtype internally when performing operations like mean, median, or variance.

Here's the corrected code for the `DataFrameGroupBy` class function `_cython_agg_blocks`:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        # existing code

        for block in data.blocks:
            # existing code

            # Extract the original values and perform the operation
            values = block.values  # Extract the original values

            result = None
            if how == "mean":
                result = values.mean(axis=0, skipna=True, dtype="float64")
            elif how == "median":
                result = values.median(axis=0, skipna=True)
            elif how == "var":
                result = values.var(axis=0, skipna=True, dtype="float64")

            result_dtype = result.dtype

            if result_dtype == 'float64':
                # Convert the result to the original dtype if it's a nullable integer
                result = result.astype(values.dtype)
            else:
                # We can safely assign the result directly if it's an integer or another type
                result = type(block.values)._from_sequence(result)

            # Create the new block with the result and any necessary adjustments

            # Append the new block and any other required updates
            # existing code

        # existing code
    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected code above, we handled the special case of nullable integer (Int64) data specifically by treating it as a floating-point dtype when performing the aggregation operations, and then converting the result back to the original dtype if needed. This approach ensures that the aggregation operations produce correct results without causing TypeError due to unsupported data type casting.
