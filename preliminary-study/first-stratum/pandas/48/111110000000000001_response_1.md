Potential error location:
The error could be caused by incorrect indexing or handling of the data in the function `_cython_agg_blocks`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug might occur due to incorrect handling of data when trying to perform aggregation operations on the DataFrameGroupBy object.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the indexing and manipulation of data within the function `_cython_agg_blocks` are performed correctly and consistently.
2. Double-check the logic for aggregating data and ensure that it accounts for all possible scenarios and edge cases.
3. Consider utilizing built-in Pandas methods for aggregation to ensure the proper handling of data.

Corrected code:
```python
    def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
        # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine
    
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    
        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        agg_items: Index = []
        
        for block in data.blocks:
            locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
            result, new_block = self.grouper.aggregate_block(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count, alt=alt)
            agg_blocks.append(new_block)
            agg_items.append(locs)
    
        return agg_blocks, agg_items
```
