I'm glad to help! Here's the full corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

        no_result = object()
        for block in data.blocks:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values.astype(float), how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )

            agg_blocks.append(block.make_block(result))

        # ... (omitted code) ...

        return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected code, the `block.values` are cast to `float` before aggregation to avoid the error related to casting from float to int. This ensures that the data types are handled appropriately during the aggregation process.
