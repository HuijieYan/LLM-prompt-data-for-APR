The error message indicates that there's a problem with casting from dtype 'float64' to dtype 'int64' while trying to perform an aggregation operation on nullable integer data.

The bug is likely in the `_cython_agg_blocks` method of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class. Specifically, the error message "TypeError: Cannot cast array from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64') according to the rule 'safe'" points to an issue with casting the data types while performing the aggregation.

The bug occurs because the function is not handling the nullable integer dtype properly when performing the aggregation. The safe casting from float64 to int64 is not being handled correctly.

To fix the bug, the function `_cython_agg_blocks` needs to be modified to properly handle the casting of nullable integer data types when performing the aggregation. Specifically, the function should check for nullable integer data types and handle the casting accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` method:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # omitted code...

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    # Handle nullable integer dtype
    if data._is_nullable_integer_dtype():
        # Convert the data to float64 for aggregation
        data = data.astype('float64')

    # Perform the aggregation
    # ...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected code, we specifically handle the nullable integer dtype before performing any aggregation, by converting the data to float64 for aggregation. This approach ensures that the casting from 'float64' to 'int64' is being handled properly.

By making this change, the bug should be fixed, and the aggregation on nullable integer data types should work as expected.
