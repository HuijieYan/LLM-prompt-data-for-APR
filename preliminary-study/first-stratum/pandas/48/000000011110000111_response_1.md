The error occurs when calling the mean, median, or var functions on a DataFrameGroupBy with the Int64 dtype. This triggers a TypeError, preventing the operations from completing successfully. The error message states that the values cannot be safely cast from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64') according to the rule 'safe'.

The potential error location within the problematic function appears to be in the `safe_cast` function, specifically where it tries to cast the values to a different dtype using the `astype` method.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `safe_cast` function is attempting to cast values from float64 to int64 using `astype`, which is not allowed due to the nullable integer data type involved.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to handle the safe casting of nullable integer data type values differently, considering the nullable aspects of the values. Another approach is to check for the data type of the values before attempting to cast them.

Below is the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, focusing on improving the safe casting:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... (existing code)

    for block in data.blocks:
        # ... (existing code)

        if numeric_only:
            # Update the data type to handle nullable integers
            if alt is None and block.dtype.name.startswith("Int"):  
                # Skip operations if alt is None and the data type is nullable
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            # Calculate the result using alt if it's provided, else use the original method
            result, _ = (self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, alt or how, axis=1, min_count=min_count))

            if isinstance(result, pd.DataFrame):
                # Perform data type handling specific to DataFrames
                # ...

        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # ... (existing code)
    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```
In this corrected code, a condition is added to skip operations when the alt parameter is None and the data type is nullable. Additionally, data type handling specific to DataFrames can be added if needed. These changes aim to address the TypeError related to casting from float64 to int64 and ensure the operations can handle nullable integer data types appropriately.
