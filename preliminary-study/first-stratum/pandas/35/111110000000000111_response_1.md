Potential error location: The issue seems to be related to the weak reference to the PeriodIndex being dropped before it's intended, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

Reasons behind the bug: The weak reference to the PeriodIndex is not being handled properly, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving a None value instead of the required PeriodIndex.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: The weak reference to the PeriodIndex should be properly managed to ensure it is not dropped prematurely.

Corrected code:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
