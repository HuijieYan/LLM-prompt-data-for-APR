The bug seems to be related to weak referencing of a PeriodIndex in a MultiIndex. The error is occurring because the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is being dropped before intended, causing the PeriodEngine to get a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, the weak reference to the PeriodIndex needs to be maintained until it is no longer needed. This can be achieved by modifying the _engine function to use weakref.proxy instead of weakref.ref.

Here's the corrected code for the _engine function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period_proxy = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_proxy, len(self))
```
