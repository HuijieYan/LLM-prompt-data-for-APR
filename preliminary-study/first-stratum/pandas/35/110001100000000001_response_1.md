The potential error in the provided code is that the variable "period" is being assigned a weak reference to "self", but then it is not being used anywhere in the return statement. This means that the function is not actually returning the weak reference. 

To fix this, the weak reference "period" should be used in the creation of the "_engine_type" object to ensure that it is being passed as intended.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import weakref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
