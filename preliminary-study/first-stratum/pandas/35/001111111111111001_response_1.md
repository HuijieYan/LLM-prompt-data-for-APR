The buggy function `_engine` is attempting to return a value by accessing the attribute `_engine_type`, which is being used to create the `_engine`. However, the `weakref` implementation might not be working correctly due to the missing self-reference. As a result, the `_engine` ends up trying to access a `NoneType` object, leading to the attribute error.

To fix this bug, one potential approach is to ensure that the `weakref` is working correctly and that the `self._engine_type` references a valid object. Additionally, verifying that the `self._values` and `len(self)` are being used appropriately is important.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period_array = self._values  # Access the correct attribute
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    if period_array is not None:  # Check if period_array is not None
        return self._engine_type(period, len(period_array))
    else:
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))  # Fall back to the original implementation if period_array is None
```
