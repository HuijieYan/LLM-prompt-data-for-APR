The error message suggests that the PeriodEngine is receiving a NoneType object instead of the expected PeriodIndex. This is likely due to the weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped before it is intended to be.

To fix this bug, we should ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is not dropped prematurely before being passed to the PeriodEngine.

Here's the fixed code for the buggy function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine_type
```

This fix explicitly assigns the result of `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` to a variable `engine_type` and returns the `engine_type`. This ensures that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is not dropped prematurely.

By making this change, the issue with the weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped should be resolved, and the error message from the test function should not occur.
