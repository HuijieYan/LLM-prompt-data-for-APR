The error occurs in the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class. It seems to be related to the `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` call inside the `_engine` method.

The error message indicates an 'AttributeError' related to 'NoneType' object, which suggests that the `_engine` method is not returning the expected type or it's returning `None`. This could be due to a mismatch in the expected return type and the actual returned value.

To fix this bug, the `_engine` method should return an instance of `self._engine_type`. Also, the `period` and `len(self)` arguments need to align with the expected inputs for `self._engine_type`.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
# Corrected function
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
In the corrected code, `period` is called as a function to get the actual period value, and this value is then passed to `self._engine_type` along with the length of `self` as arguments. This should resolve the issue and align with the expected behavior in the test case.
