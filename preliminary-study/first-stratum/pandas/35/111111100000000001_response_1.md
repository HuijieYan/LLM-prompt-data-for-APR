Potential error location:
The error might be occurring at the line `period = weakref.ref(self)` because the `self` reference might not be getting correctly passed as a weak reference.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug might be occurring due to the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref()` to create a weak reference to the `self` object.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we can use the `weakref.proxy` method to create a weak reference to the `self` object.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
# this is the fixed function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
