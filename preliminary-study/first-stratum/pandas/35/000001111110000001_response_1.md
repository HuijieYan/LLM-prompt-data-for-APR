The error message indicates that there is an 'AttributeError' with the 'NoneType' object in the 'PeriodEngine' which is associated with the '_engine' function in the 'period.py' file. The error occurs when trying to access the 'view' attribute of the 'NoneType' object.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line that returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. It seems that the `_engine_type` is not being properly instantiated or contains a None value, leading to the AttributeError when trying to access the 'view' attribute.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be an issue with the initialization of the `_engine_type` attribute, which could result in it being set to None instead of the expected type.

One possible approach to fixing the bug would be to ensure that the `_engine_type` attribute is properly initialized with the correct type. This could involve checking the code responsible for instantiating the `_engine` function and ensuring that the `_engine_type` is set to a valid value.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/pandas_35/pandas/core/indexes/period.py

from weakref import ref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if self._engine_type else None
```
