The bug seems to be in the `_engine` function, where it is trying to create an instance of `self._engine_type` with the arguments `period` and `len(self)`. However, `self._engine_type` is a class and should be instantiated using the `()` operator, not with the square brackets `[]`, as in the line `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.

To fix the bug, we need to instantiate `self._engine_type` with the correct arguments.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._values))
```
