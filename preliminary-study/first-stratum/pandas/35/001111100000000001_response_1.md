The potential error in the provided function is that the `_engine_type` seems to be a method or attribute of the class, but it is being used as a variable or class attribute.

The error message might be related to referencing `_engine_type` incorrectly.

The bug occurred because `_engine_type` is being used as if it's a method or attribute of the class, but it's not defined within the given code. It could be defined in a parent class, but it's not clear from the provided code. 

To fix the bug, we can assume that `_engine_type` is a method of the parent class or a separate function that needs to be referenced correctly.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In this corrected code, we are assuming that `_engine_type` is a method of the parent class that needs to be called using `self._engine_type()`. If `_engine_type` is part of a separate module or function, it should be imported and called accordingly.
