The bug seems to be related to the _engine method in the PeriodIndex class. The _engine method is using weakref.ref incorrectly, and it's not returning the correct value.

The _engine method is supposed to return an instance of the PeriodEngine class, passing a weak reference to the current PeriodIndex object and the length of the index.

It's hard to pinpoint the exact reason for the bug without seeing the rest of the code, but one possibility is that the weak reference creation and usage are incorrect, resulting in the _engine method not returning the expected PeriodEngine instance.

To fix the bug, the _engine method should return an instance of the PeriodEngine class, passing a weak reference of the PeriodIndex object and the length of the index.

Here's the corrected code for the _engine method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._index))
```
