The error message indicates that there is an issue with weak references and the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the intended PeriodIndex. This is likely causing the AttributeError when trying to access the view attribute on a NoneType object.

The potentially problematic function is the `_engine` method within the `PeriodIndex` class. This method is using a weak reference to avoid a reference cycle, but it seems like the weak reference is not being retained as intended. This is causing the PeriodEngine to receive a NoneType object instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix this bug, one possible approach could be to ensure that the weak reference to self (PeriodIndex object) is being properly retained within the `_engine` method. This could involve modifying how the weak reference is being used or ensuring that the reference is not dropped prematurely.

The corrected code for the `_engine` method within the `PeriodIndex` class could look like this:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    self._cached_engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return self._cached_engine
```

In the corrected code, a new attribute `_cached_engine` is introduced to retain the weak reference to the PeriodIndex object, ensuring that it is not dropped prematurely. This should address the issue of the PeriodEngine receiving a NoneType object and resolve the AttributeError.
