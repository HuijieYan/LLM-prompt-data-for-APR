The potential error location within the problematic function is the `_engine` method. The error message indicates that the `PeriodEngine` is receiving a `None` object instead of the expected `PeriodIndex` instance. This suggests that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped prematurely.

The bug is likely occurring because the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is not being held onto sufficiently, causing it to be garbage collected before the `PeriodEngine` needs it.

To fix this issue, the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` needs to be held onto so that it is not garbage collected prematurely.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` method:

```python
from pandas.core.indexes.period import PeriodEngine

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    self._period_ref = period  # Hold onto the weakly referenced PeriodIndex
    return PeriodEngine(period, len(self))
```

By holding onto the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` in the `_period_ref` attribute, it ensures that the `PeriodEngine` has access to the `PeriodIndex` instance when needed, preventing the premature garbage collection issue.
