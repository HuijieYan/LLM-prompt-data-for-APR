1. The test case creates a MultiIndex from a PeriodIndex and then checks if all levels of the resulting index are monotonic. However, this assertion fails with an AttributeError, indicating that a 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the `_engine` method. The error message indicates that the `PeriodEngine` is receiving a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`, which leads to the AttributeError when trying to access the 'view' attribute.

3. The bug occurs because the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped before it should be, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex` object.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is correctly passed to the `PeriodEngine`, so that it does not receive a `None` instead.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    memo = {}
    def wrapper(*args):
        if args not in memo:
            memo[args] = func(*args)
        return memo[args]
    return wrapper

class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, engine_type):
        self._engine_type = engine_type

    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected code, the `_engine` method is updated to include the `cache_readonly` decorator, and the weak reference to `self` is correctly passed to the `_engine_type` method to avoid the reference cycle and ensure that the `PeriodEngine` receives the correct input.
