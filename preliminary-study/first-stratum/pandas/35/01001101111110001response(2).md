The error message 'AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'' suggests that the _engine function may be returning None instead of the expected type, causing the subsequent code to fail when trying to access the 'view' attribute of the returned object.

The bug in the _engine function is likely due to the use of the @cache_readonly decorator, which may not be implemented correctly. This decorator is probably intended to cache the result of the function to improve performance, but it appears to be causing the function to return None in certain cases instead of the expected type.

To fix the bug, the @cache_readonly decorator should be checked and potentially corrected to ensure that it properly caches and returns the expected type.

Here's the corrected code for the _engine function:

```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    result = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return result
```

By removing the @cache_readonly decorator and explicitly returning the result, we can ensure that the function correctly returns the expected type and resolves the bug.
