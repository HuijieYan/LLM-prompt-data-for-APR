The potential error in the provided function is that it is not correctly using the weakref to avoid a reference cycle, which leads to the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the weak reference to self (PeriodIndex) is not being properly passed to _engine_type.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
        if not hasattr(self, '_cache'):
            self._cache = {}
        if func.__name__ not in self._cache:
            self._cache[func.__name__] = func(self, *args, **kwargs)
        return self._cache[func.__name__]
    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By using `period()` instead of just `period` when calling the weakref, we ensure that we get the weakly referenced object and pass it to _engine_type.

This should fix the issue and ensure that the PeriodIndex is correctly referenced and passed to _engine_type, addressing the bug described in the GitHub issue.
