The error message indicates that there is an AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view' in the function _engine. This means that the _engine function is returning None instead of the expected value, which leads to the AttributeError when trying to access the 'view' attribute.

The potential error location within the _engine function is the return statement. It seems that the weakref.ref(self) operation might not be returning the expected value.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be that the weak reference creation might not be working correctly, leading to the reference to the original object being lost and the return of None.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference creation and retrieval are done correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the _engine function:

```python
import weakref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    weak_self = period_ref()
    return self._engine_type(weak_self, len(self))
```

In the corrected code, the weak reference to the self object is retrieved using the period_ref and then used in the _engine_type function. This should prevent the occurrence of the NoneType attribute error and ensure that the weak reference to the self object is maintained.
