The bug seems to be occurring in the `_engine` function. When returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, it seems that there is an issue with the `PeriodIndex` object being referenced. The error message `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` indicates that a NoneType object is being operated on as if it were not None.

The issue is likely due to the weak reference used to avoid a reference cycle, which may not be working as expected. This could be causing the `PeriodIndex` object to be set to `None` when it should not be.

To fix the bug, the weak reference should be implemented correctly, ensuring that the `PeriodIndex` object is not set to `None`. This may involve revisiting the use of weak references and understanding the context in which they are being used.

```python
import weakref

def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.ref(self)()` we can ensure that the weak reference is correctly used to avoid a reference cycle without causing the `PeriodIndex` object to become `None`.
