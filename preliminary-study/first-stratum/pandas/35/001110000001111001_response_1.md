The buggy function `_engine` is defined as a `@cache_readonly` method. Its purpose is to return an instance of the `_engine_type` class, which seems to handle period-related operations. However, the implementation seems correct, and the error might be related to the way the function is used in the context of the larger codebase.

The potential error may be related to how the `weakref` is being used to avoid a reference cycle. The weak reference is created outside the function and might not be necessary, or it could be causing unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we can remove the use of `weakref` and return the `_engine_type` instance directly. Since the `length` is also being passed to the `_engine_type` constructor, we need to ensure that the length is obtained from the `self` object.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
