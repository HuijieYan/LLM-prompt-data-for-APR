The error seems to be occurring at the `is_monotonic` check within the `test_get_level_values_when_periods` test function. The error message indicates that the `PeriodEngine` receives a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`, leading to an `AttributeError`.

The potential error location is in the `PeriodIndex` class, specifically in the `_engine` method. The `_engine` method returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, but it seems that `self` may not be passed correctly as `period`.

The bug occurs because the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` does not get dropped prematurely when passed to the `PeriodEngine`. This can be achieved by correctly passing the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` to the `PeriodEngine`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
