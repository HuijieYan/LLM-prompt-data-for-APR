The issue with the provided code is that it's using a decorator `@cache_readonly` without actually defining what `cache_readonly` does. Additionally, the weakref implementation seems to be incorrect for the given input and expected values. 

The function _engine is supposed to return an instance of the class self._engine_type, passing the period (which is a weak reference to self) and the length of self as parameters.

To fix this, we need to remove the @cache_readonly decorator, as it seems unrelated to the function at hand. Additionally, we need to create a weak reference to self for passing as a parameter to self._engine_type. 

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With the corrected code, the _engine function should now work as expected, returning an instance of self._engine_type with the weak reference to self as the first parameter.
