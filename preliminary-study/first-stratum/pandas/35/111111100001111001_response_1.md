Potential Error Location: The error is occurring in the _engine function due to the weakref.ref(self) statement.

Reason for the Bug: The weakref module is being used to create a weak reference to the self object, but it is not being properly utilized. The weak reference should be passed to _engine_type, but this is not happening in the current implementation.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug: To fix the bug, the weak reference to the self object should be properly passed to _engine_type.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
