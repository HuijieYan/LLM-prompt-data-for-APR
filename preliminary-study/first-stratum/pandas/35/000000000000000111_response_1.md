Potential Error Location:
The bug seems to be in the function `_engine` where it returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. The use of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object may not be functioning as intended.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before the intended usage, leading to `None` being passed to the `PeriodEngine` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
One possible approach to fix this bug is to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained until it is no longer needed. This can be done by modifying the weak reference implementation or by finding an alternative approach to achieve the same result.

Corrected Code:
```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    def wrapper(self):
        if not hasattr(self, '_cache'):
            self._cache = {}
        if func.__name__ not in self._cache:
            self._cache[func.__name__] = func(self)
        return self._cache[func.__name__]
    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
