The bug is occurring in the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the weakref for `PeriodIndex` being dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This is causing an AttributeError when trying to access the view method on a NoneType object.

To fix this bug, you should ensure that the weakref for `PeriodIndex` is maintained correctly so that it does not get dropped prematurely.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` method:

```python
# Corrected _engine method
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if period() is not None else None
```

This code ensures that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is still available when used in the `_engine_type`, preventing the NoneType error.
