The error occurs when the test function attempts to check whether all levels of the MultiIndex are monotonic. The error message indicates that the PeriodEngine is receiving a NoneType object instead of the intended PeriodIndex, causing an AttributeError.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the implementation of the `_engine` method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

The reason behind the bug is that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is dropped before intended, so the PeriodEngine gets a None instead of the PeriodIndex, leading to the AttributeError.

To fix the bug, the weak reference needs to be properly implemented to ensure that the PeriodIndex is not dropped prematurely. Additionally, the implementation of the `_engine_type` method should be checked to ensure it is properly receiving and handling the weakly referenced object.

Below is the corrected code for the `_engine` method:

```python
import weakref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

In this corrected version, the weak reference is properly stored in the `period_ref` variable, which ensures that the PeriodIndex object will not be dropped prematurely.
