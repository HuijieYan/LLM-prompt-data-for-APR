The error occurs in the `_engine` function, which is attempting to pass a weak reference of `self` to the `_engine_type`, but due to incorrect implementation, it is not working as intended.

The bug is occurring because the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is being dropped before it is intended to be, causing the PeriodEngine to receive None instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, the weak reference should be maintained until it is actually needed by the PeriodEngine.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self) if period is not None else 0)
```
