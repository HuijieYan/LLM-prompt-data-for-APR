The error message indicates that the `PeriodEngine` is receiving a `None` object instead of the `PeriodIndex`, causing an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute.

The potential error location within the `_engine` function is the line `period = weakref.ref(self)` which is intended to create a weak reference to the `self` object. However, the weak reference should be passed to `self._engine_type` instead of just `self`.

The bug occurs because the weak reference to `self` is not correctly passed to `_engine_type`, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a None object instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `_engine` function to correctly pass the weak reference to `_engine_type`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By invoking the weak reference `period` as `period()`, we ensure that the weak reference is converted back to the original object before being passed to `_engine_type`. This should resolve the issue described in the error message.
