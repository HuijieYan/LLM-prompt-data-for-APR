The buggy function `_engine` is using a `weakref` to create a reference to `self`, but the returned value is not being stored in a variable. This means that the weak reference gets garbage collected immediately, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix this, we can store the weak reference in a variable and then return that variable. This will prevent the weak reference from being garbage collected prematurely.

The corrected code for the `_engine` function is as follows:

```python
import weakref

# file name: /Users/jerry/.abw/BugsInPy_Dir/BugsInPy_Cloned_Repos/pandas/pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return period
```
