The error message indicates that there is an issue with accessing the `view` attribute on a `NoneType` object. This suggests that the `_engine` implementation in the `PeriodIndex` class is not returning the expected type.

The error occurs when the `idx2` object is created using `_get_level_values` and then the `is_monotonic` property is accessed, which relies on the `view` attribute, leading to the AttributeError.

The problem arises from the `_engine` function, where `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` should be returning an instance of an engine type, but is instead returning `None`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine` function returns an instance of the expected engine type rather than `None`.

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        engine = self._make_engine(period, len(self))
    return engine
```

This fix introduces a call to the `_make_engine` method if the `_engine_type` returns `None`, allowing for the creation of a new engine when needed.

Note: If the `_make_engine` method does not exist in the class, it will need to be added to provide the necessary functionality.
