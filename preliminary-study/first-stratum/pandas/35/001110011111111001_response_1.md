The error occurs in the `_engine` function, specifically in the line `return super(PeriodEngine, self).vgetter().view("i8")`. The error message indicates that `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, which suggests that `self._engine_type` is not properly instantiated or assigned.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `_engine` function is not correctly handling the instantiation of `self._engine_type`.

To fix this bug, the `_engine` function should include proper instantiation and assignment of `self._engine_type` before using it to avoid the 'NoneType' error.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    self._engine_type = pandas._libs.index.PeriodEngine  # Instantiate _engine_type
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
