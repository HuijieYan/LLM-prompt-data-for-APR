The error message indicates that an 'AttributeError' is raised because a 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view' at the line `return super(PeriodEngine, self).vgetter().view("i8")` in the `is_monotonic_increasing` method within the `IndexEngine` class.

The reason for the error is that the `_engine` method is returning a weak reference (`period = weakref.ref(self)`) instead of returning the actual value needed by the `IndexEngine` class. This is causing the `IndexEngine` to receive a 'None' object instead of the expected PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` method should return the actual value of `_engine_type` instantiated with the weak reference of `self`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

With this change, the `_engine` method will return the actual value of `_engine_type` instantiated with the weak reference of `self`, which should resolve the 'NoneType' object attribute error.
