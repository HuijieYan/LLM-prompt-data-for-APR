The error is occurring in the `PeriodIndex._engine` method when trying to access the `vgetter` attribute of the `PeriodEngine`, which is resulting in an `AttributeError` due to a `NoneType` object.

The bug is likely happening because the weak reference to `self` is being dropped before it should be. This causes the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex` when it tries to access its attributes.

To fix the bug, the weak reference to `self` should be maintained until it is no longer needed. This can be achieved by modifying the `_engine` method to properly handle weak references.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from weakref import ref

# ...

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `from weakref import ref` and creating a weak reference to `self`, the reference to `self` will be maintained as long as there are strong references to the `PeriodIndex` instance, and the issue with the `NoneType` object accessing the `PeriodIndex` attributes should be resolved.
