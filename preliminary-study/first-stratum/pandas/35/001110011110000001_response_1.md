The error message indicates that there is an issue with the `PeriodEngine` class or the implementation of `PeriodEngine.vgetter().view("i8")`. This problem occurs while trying to access the `view` attribute of a `NoneType` object, which suggests that there is a problem with the initialization of `PeriodEngine` or the assignment of its attribute.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. It's likely that the `_engine_type` method is not returning the correct type of object, leading to the issue.

The bug occurred due to the incorrect implementation of the `_engine` method in the `PeriodIndex` class. The `_engine_type` method does not seem to return a valid `PeriodEngine` object, leading to the `NoneType` error when trying to access its attributes.

To fix this bug:
1. Ensure that the `_engine_type` method returns a valid `PeriodEngine` object.
2. Check for any issues related to weak reference handling that might be causing the problem.
3. Verify that the parameters passed to `_engine_type` are correct and valid.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` method:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type_result = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if isinstance(engine_type_result, PeriodEngine):
        return engine_type_result
    else:
        raise TypeError("_engine_type did not return a valid PeriodEngine object")
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to ensure that the `_engine_type` method returns a valid `PeriodEngine` object. If the return value is not of the expected type, it raises a `TypeError` with a meaningful error message.
