The error occurs in the `assert` statement of the `test_get_level_values_when_periods` function. The error message indicates that the `PeriodEngine` is receiving a `NoneType` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`. This is leading to the `AttributeError` when attempting to access the `view` attribute.

The bug occurs in the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class, specifically in the following line:
```python
period = weakref.ref(self)
```
The use of `weakref.ref` seems to be incorrect here. It should be used to create a weak reference to an object, but it's being assigned to `period` without being used later in the function. This is causing the reference to be lost, leading to the `NoneType` error.

To fix the bug, the correct implementation should be to use `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref` to create a proxy weak reference to the `self` object. This will prevent the reference from being lost prematurely.

The corrected code for the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class would be:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period_proxy = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_proxy, len(self))
```
