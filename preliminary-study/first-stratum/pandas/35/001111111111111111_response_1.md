The bug is likely located in the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class. The error message suggests that the `PeriodEngine` is receiving a `NoneType` object instead of a `PeriodIndex`.

The error occurs because the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before intended, so the `PeriodEngine` gets a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This results in the `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute of the `NoneType` object.

To fix the bug, the weak reference to the `self` object should be handled properly to ensure that it is not dropped prematurely.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if period() is not None else None
```
