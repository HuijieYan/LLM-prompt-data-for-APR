The error message indicates that the bug is likely located in the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class. The error is related to weak referencing and results in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

The `_engine` method is using weak referencing, and it seems that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before it should be. The `NoneType` error occurs because the `PeriodEngine` receives a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`. This leads to the AttributeError `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`.

To fix this bug, the weak referencing of `PeriodIndex` needs to be handled properly within the `_engine` method to ensure that it is not dropped prematurely.

Below is the corrected code for the `_engine` method:
```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if period() is not None else None
```
In this corrected code, a conditional statement is added to check if the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is not `None` before creating the PeriodEngine. If the weak reference is `None`, it returns `None` instead of creating the engine.
