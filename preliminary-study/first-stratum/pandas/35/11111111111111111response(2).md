The error occurs in the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class. The error message indicates that the `PeriodEngine` is receiving a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

This might be happening because the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is not being properly maintained, leading to it being garbage-collected prematurely. As a result, when the `PeriodEngine` tries to access the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex`, it receives a `None` instead.

To fix this issue, the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` should be properly maintained in the `_engine` method so that it is not garbage-collected prematurely. This can be achieved by ensuring that the weak reference does not go out of scope.

The corrected code for the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class is as follows:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Maintain a reference to 'self' to avoid premature garbage collection
    self._weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    
    # Create the PeriodEngine with the weak reference to self
    return self._engine_type(self._weakref, len(self))
```

By maintaining a reference to `self` using a class attribute `_weakref`, we can ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is not garbage-collected prematurely. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the `PeriodEngine` receives the expected `PeriodIndex`.
