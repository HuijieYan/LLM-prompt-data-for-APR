The issue seems to be related to weak referencing of the `PeriodIndex` object, which causes the `PeriodEngine` to receive a None instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

The potential error location within the function is the creation of the weak reference to `self` and its usage in `_engine_type`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the weak reference to `self` is not maintained properly, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a None instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained throughout the usage in `_engine_type`, ensuring that the `PeriodIndex` object is not dropped prematurely.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/pandas_35/pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
In the corrected code, we use `weakref.proxy` to create a weak reference to `self` and ensure that it is maintained throughout the usage in `_engine_type`. This should prevent the premature dropping of the `PeriodIndex` object and resolve the issue described in the bug report.
