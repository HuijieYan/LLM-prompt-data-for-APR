The error occurs due to the weak reference to the PeriodIndex being dropped before it is intended, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex. This causes the raised error when checking for monotonicity.

To fix this bug, we can modify the _engine function to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained until it is no longer needed.

Here is the corrected code for the _engine function:

```python
import weakref

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/pandas_35/pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)  # create a weak reference to self
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))  # pass the weak reference to _engine_type
    return engine
```
By maintaining a weak reference to the PeriodIndex and passing it to the _engine_type, we ensure that the reference is not dropped prematurely, thereby fixing the bug.
