The error occurs when the `_engine` function is called, and it returns `None` instead of the expected `PeriodEngine`. This causes an attribute error when trying to access the `view` attribute of a `NoneType` object.

The reason behind this bug is the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object not being maintained properly, causing it to be dropped before it should be. This results in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object should be maintained properly to ensure it is not dropped prematurely. This can be achieved by modifying the `_engine` function to properly maintain the weak reference.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
import weakref

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/pandas_35/pandas/core/indexes/period.py

def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))()
```

With this correction, the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object will be maintained properly, and the bug causing the attribute error will be fixed.
