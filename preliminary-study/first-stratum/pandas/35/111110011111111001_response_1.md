Potential Error Location:
The error seems to occur at the line `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))` in the `_engine` function. This suggests that the reference to `_engine_type` is not being handled properly and is resulting in a `NoneType` error.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The error occurs because the `_engine_type` attribute is not being properly instantiated or assigned before being called in the `_engine` function. This results in the attribute being `None`, leading to the `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` error.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check where `_engine_type` is being assigned or instantiated and ensure that it is not set to `None`.
2. Verify that the attribute is correctly assigned at the class level or during initialization of the `PeriodIndex` class.
3. Use debug statements or a debugger to trace the flow of attribute assignment and usage to identify the exact location of the issue.

Corrected Code:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    if self._engine_type is not None:  # Checking if _engine_type is not None
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    else:
        raise AttributeError("_engine_type is not defined")
```
