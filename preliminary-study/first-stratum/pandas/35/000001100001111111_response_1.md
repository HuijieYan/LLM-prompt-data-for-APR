Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the weak reference usage in the `_engine` function. When the weakly referenced `self` is passed to `_engine_type`, it is getting dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

Reasons behind the bug: The weak reference usage is causing the `PeriodIndex` object to be dropped prematurely, leading to a `None` being passed to the `PeriodEngine`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: One possible approach to fix this bug is to handle the weak reference properly to ensure that the `PeriodIndex` object is not dropped before intended. This can be achieved by modifying the way the weak reference is created and passed to the `_engine_type`.

Corrected code:
```python
import weakref

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/pandas_35/pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
