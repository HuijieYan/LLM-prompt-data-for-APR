The error message is raised in the `test_get_level_values_when_periods` test function, specifically at the line `assert all(x.is_monotonic for x in idx2.levels)`. The error is related to the `is_monotonic` property of the `idx2` object, which tries to access `self._engine.is_monotonic_increasing` and results in an AttributeError.

The bug seems to be in the `_engine` function. The function tries to return `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, but it seems that the `_engine_type` method is not returning the expected type of object, which leads to an AttributeError in the subsequent test case.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should be able to handle the `self._engine_type` correctly and return the expected object type.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    def wrapper(self):
        if not hasattr(self, '_cache'):
            self._cache = func(self)
        return self._cache
    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))._do_monotonic_check()
```

In this corrected code, a decorator `cache_readonly` is defined to handle the caching of the `_engine` function. The `_engine` function now calls `_do_monotonic_check` on the `self._engine_type` object and returns the result, allowing the subsequent test case to execute without raising an AttributeError.
