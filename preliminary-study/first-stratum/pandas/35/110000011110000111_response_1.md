1. The test case is attempting to create a MultiIndex from a PeriodIndex and then check if all levels are monotonic. However, it is encountering an error related to weakrefs and the PeriodEngine.

2. The potential error location within the function is the usage of weakref.ref(self). It seems that the weak reference is not being properly handled, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the intended PeriodIndex.

3. The bug is likely occurring due to the weak reference not being retained properly. Weak references are used to avoid reference cycles and prevent memory leaks, but in this case, it seems that the weak reference is being dropped before it should be, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the weakly referenced PeriodIndex.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include ensuring that the weak reference is properly retained and utilized within the _engine function. Additionally, checking for any potential issues with the creation of the PeriodIndex or weak referencing process could also be helpful in resolving the bug.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
        if "_engine" not in self.__dict__:
            self._engine = func(self, *args, **kwargs)
        return self._engine
    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))

```
In the corrected code, the cache_readonly decorator wraps the _engine function to ensure that it is only executed once and the result is cached. The weak reference handling within the _engine function remains the same, but the caching mechanism is now properly implemented.
