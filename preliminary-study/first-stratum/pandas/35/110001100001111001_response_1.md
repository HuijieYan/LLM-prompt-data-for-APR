The potential error in the provided function is that it is using a `@cache_readonly` decorator, which suggests that the function is intended to be a property, but it is defined with the `def` keyword instead of using the `@property` decorator. This could lead to unexpected behavior and errors.

To fix this, the function should be defined as a property using the `@property` decorator. This will ensure that the function behaves as intended and accesses the necessary attributes of the object it is called on.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/pandas_35/pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@property
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
