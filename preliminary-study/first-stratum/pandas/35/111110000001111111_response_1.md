The bug is occurring in the `_engine` function of the PeriodIndex class. The function is using a weakref to create a reference to the `self` object, but it seems that the weak reference is being dropped before it is intended to be.

The weak reference is being passed to the `_engine_type` attribute, which is a class `pandas._libs.index.PeriodEngine`. This weak reference is used to avoid a reference cycle, but it seems that the weak reference is not being maintained for the intended duration.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained for the lifetime of the `_engine` function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type
    return engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By storing the `_engine_type` in a separate variable and using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference, we can maintain the weak reference for the intended duration. This should fix the bug and ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is not dropped prematurely.
