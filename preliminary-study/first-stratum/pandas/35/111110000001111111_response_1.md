The bug seems to be occurring in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The function is creating a weak reference to `self` (`PeriodIndex`) and passing it to `_engine_type`, but it seems that the weak reference is getting dropped before intended, causing the `_engine_type` to receive `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, the weak reference to `self` should be handled properly to ensure it is not dropped prematurely. One approach to achieve this is to store the weak reference in a separate variable before passing it to `_engine_type`. This will ensure that the weak reference is not lost before it is used by `_engine_type`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store a weak reference to self
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    # Pass the stored weak reference to _engine_type
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference to `self` will be preserved until it is used by `_engine_type`. This should prevent the issue of `_engine_type` receiving `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.
