The error message is indicating that the program is encountering an AttributeError due to a 'NoneType' object not having the attribute 'view'. This suggests that the problematic function, _engine, is returning a 'None' object instead of the expected object.

The potential error location is within the _engine function, specifically the return statement where it is supposed to return self._engine_type(period, len(self)).

The bug is occurring because the weak reference to self, 'period', is not being properly utilized when calling self._engine_type. This results in the function returning None instead of the expected object.

To fix the bug, the weak reference 'period' should be properly used when calling self._engine_type. The weak reference object should be accessed using the '()' to obtain the strong reference before passing it to self._engine_type.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
