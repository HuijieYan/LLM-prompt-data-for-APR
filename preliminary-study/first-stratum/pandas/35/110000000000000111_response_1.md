The bug is occurring in the _engine method of the PeriodIndex class. The method is using weakref to create a weak reference to self (the PeriodIndex object) and pass it to the _engine_type constructor. However, due to a problem in the weak reference implementation, the _engine method is returning None instead of the expected _engine_type object.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to self is being used correctly and that the _engine_type constructor is receiving the correct arguments.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
        cache_attr = f'_{func.__name__}_cache'
        if not hasattr(self, cache_attr):
            setattr(self, cache_attr, func(self, *args, **kwargs))
        return getattr(self, cache_attr)
    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
