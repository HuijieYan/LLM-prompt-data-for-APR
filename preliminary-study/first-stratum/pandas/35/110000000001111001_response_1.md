The issue with the provided function is that it is using a decorator `@cache_readonly` which is not defined in the given code. It seems that the intention is to use a caching decorator to memoize the result of the `_engine` method, but the actual implementation is missing.

Since the decorator `@cache_readonly` is not defined, it is assumed that the intention is to use the `functools.lru_cache` decorator from Python's standard library to cache the result of the `_engine` method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `@lru_cache` decorator, the result of the `_engine` method will be cached and subsequent calls with the same input parameters will return the cached result, which can improve performance.
