Potential error location: The error seems to be occurring in the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class. The bug may be caused by the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

Reasons behind the bug:
The weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` may not be handled correctly, leading to it being dropped prematurely. This results in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`, leading to the error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is handled correctly within the `_engine` method to prevent it from being dropped prematurely.
2. Verify the code that handles weakly referenced objects and make necessary adjustments to ensure the reference is maintained as needed.

Corrected code for the `_engine` method:

```python
from weakref import ref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
In the corrected code, the weak reference to `self` is created using the `ref` function from the `weakref` module. This ensures that the reference to `self` is maintained as intended, addressing the issue of the `PeriodIndex` being dropped prematurely.
