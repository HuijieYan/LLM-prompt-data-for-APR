Potential error location: The problematic function _engine is likely causing the weakly referenced PeriodIndex to be dropped before it should be, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

Reasons behind the bug: The weakref.ref(self) is being used to create a weak reference to the PeriodIndex self, which is then passed to the _engine_type constructor. However, it seems that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is dropped before it should be, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is not dropped before it should be.
2. Check the implementation of the _engine_type constructor to confirm that it is properly handling weak references.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine
```
