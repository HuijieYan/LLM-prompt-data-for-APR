The error message 'AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'' suggests that the variable being accessed as 'view' is of type 'NoneType', meaning it is currently pointing to a 'None' object and not the expected data type. This implies that the buggy function is returning 'None' instead of the expected type.

The bug seems to be occurring in the `_engine` function where it should be returning an object of type `self._engine_type` but instead is returning a 'None' object.

To fix the bug, the return statement in the `_engine` function should be modified to ensure that it returns an object of the expected type. Additionally, any operations or assignments within the function that might be affecting the return value should be reviewed.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
from pandas._libs.index import PeriodEngine

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return PeriodEngine(period, len(self))
```
In the corrected code, the return statement now returns an object of type `PeriodEngine`, ensuring that the function returns the expected type instead of 'None'.
