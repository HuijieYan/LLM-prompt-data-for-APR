Potential Error Location: The potential error lies within the use of the undefined `@cache_readonly` decorator and the use of `weakref.ref(self)`, which seems to be incorrect in this context.

Reason for the Bug: The `@cache_readonly` decorator is not a standard Python decorator, and it seems that it is causing the issue. Additionally, the use of `weakref.ref(self)` may not be the correct approach for creating a weak reference to `self`.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Replace the `@cache_readonly` decorator with a standard caching mechanism such as `functools.lru_cache`.
2. Use `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`.

Corrected Code:
```python
import functools
import weakref

@functools.lru_cache()
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
