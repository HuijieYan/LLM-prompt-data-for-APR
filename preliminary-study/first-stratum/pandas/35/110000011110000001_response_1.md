The error is occurring in the `_engine` method of the PeriodIndex class. The error message is indicating that the `_engine` attribute is a `NoneType` object and does not have the attribute `view`.

The bug is likely stemming from the `_engine` method returning a `None` value instead of an instance of a valid object. This could be occurring due to invalid initialization or improper handling of weak reference in the function.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine` method returns a valid instance of the engine type instead of `None`. Additionally, proper management of weak references should be implemented to avoid reference cycles and ensure the correct behavior of the `_engine` method.

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    def wrapper(self):
        if hasattr(self, '_cached_engine'):
            return self._cached_engine
        else:
            period = weakref.ref(self)
            self._cached_engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
            return self._cached_engine
    return wrapper

def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
