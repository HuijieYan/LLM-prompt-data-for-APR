The error occurs when the method `is_monotonic_increasing` is called on the PeriodIndex levels in the test function. This method calls `self._engine.is_monotonic_increasing`, which eventually leads to an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`.
The bug is likely occurring in the `_engine` method itself, where `self._engine_type` is being called but not returning an instance of `PeriodEngine`, which is causing the subsequent error.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `_engine` method to ensure that it returns an instance of `PeriodEngine` when called.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
from functools import wraps

def cache_readonly(method):
    @wraps(method)
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
    return _engine
```

By using the `@wraps` decorator, we ensure that the attributes of the original method are preserved in the wrapper function. Additionally, we need to ensure that the `self._engine_type` returns an instance of `PeriodEngine`. Once these changes are made, the bug should be resolved.
