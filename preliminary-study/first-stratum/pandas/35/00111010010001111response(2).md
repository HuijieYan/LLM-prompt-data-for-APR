The error occurs when the function `is_monotonic_increasing` tries to access the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` through the `_engine` attribute, but the weak reference has been dropped and the `PeriodEngine` gets a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This results in the AttributeError.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `PeriodIndex` is maintained and accessible when needed by the `PeriodEngine`.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This correction ensures that the weak reference to `self` is passed to `_engine_type` to prevent the reference cycle and maintain access to `PeriodIndex` as intended.
