The error occurs because the `_engine` method is returning a `NoneType` object, leading to an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` method should return an instance of the `self._engine_type` class, rather than calling it and returning the result, which seems to be causing the issue. 

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)).vgetter().view("i8")
```
