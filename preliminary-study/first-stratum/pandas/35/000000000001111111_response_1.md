Potential error location:
The error is likely occurring in the `_engine` function due to the weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped before it's intended. This causes the `_engine_type` to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The weak reference to the PeriodIndex is being dropped prematurely, leading to the _engine_type receiving a None instead of the expected PeriodIndex.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the weak reference to the PeriodIndex should be retained until it is no longer needed by the _engine_type. This can be achieved by ensuring that the weak reference is kept alive throughout the execution of the _engine function.


# Corrected code for the problematic function
```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    def wrapper(self):
        if not hasattr(self, '_cache'):
            self._cache = {}
        if func.__name__ not in self._cache:
            self._cache[func.__name__] = func(self)
        return self._cache[func.__name__]
    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self._values)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._values))
```
