The error occurs because the `_engine` function is returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, but `period` is created as a weak reference to `self`, which means it can be garbage collected when no other references to `self` are left. This leads to an AttributeError when `self._engine_type` tries to access the weakly referenced `period`.

To fix this, we need to maintain a strong reference to `self` within the `_engine` function so that `self` does not get garbage collected before its intended use.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Maintain a strong reference to self
    self._period_ref = self
    # Pass the strong reference to _engine_type instead of a weakref
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

In this corrected code, we store a strong reference to `self` in the `_period_ref` attribute, and we pass `self` directly to `_engine_type`. This ensures that `self` remains alive and accessible within the `_engine` function.

These changes will prevent the AttributeError that was occurring due to the weakly referenced `period`.
