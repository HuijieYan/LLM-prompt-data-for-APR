The bug seems to be related to weak reference handling within the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The expected output is not being achieved due to the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this issue, we should modify the `_engine` function to properly handle weak references. 

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)).if_class_is_None_then_return(period)
```

In the corrected code, we're returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self)).if_class_is_None_then_return(period)` to handle the weak reference properly and avoid the issue of `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.
