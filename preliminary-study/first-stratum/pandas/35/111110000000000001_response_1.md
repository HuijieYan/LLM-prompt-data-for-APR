The potential error in the given function is the reference to `self` within the `_engine` method. The use of `weakref.ref(self)` is incorrect because `weakref.ref` returns a weak reference to the object passed as an argument, not the argument itself. 

The bug occurs because the code is trying to create a weak reference to self within the _engine method, but the syntax used is incorrect and does not achieve the intended purpose of avoiding a reference cycle.

To fix the bug, the correct approach is to use `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
