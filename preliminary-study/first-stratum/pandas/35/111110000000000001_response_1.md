Potential Error Location:
The error seems to be related to the use of `@cache_readonly` decorator on the `_engine` method.

Reason for the Bug:
The `@cache_readonly` decorator might not be implemented correctly or might not be compatible with the `_engine` method.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the implementation of the `@cache_readonly` decorator and ensure it is used correctly.
2. Verify if the `_engine` method is compatible with the `@cache_readonly` decorator.
3. If the `@cache_readonly` decorator is causing the issue, consider removing it and implementing a custom caching mechanism for the `_engine` method.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
