The error seems to occur when the `is_monotonic` property is being accessed on the `idx2` MultiIndex object. This property calls the `is_monotonic_increasing` property which in turn tries to access the `_engine` property. However, the `_engine` property seems to be returning a `NoneType` object, leading to the AttributeError.

The reason behind this bug could be that the weak reference to `self` is being assigned to `period`, but it is not being used when creating the PeriodIndex. This could result in the weak reference being dropped prematurely, leading to the `_engine` property receiving a `NoneType` instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix this bug, the weak reference to `self` should be properly utilized in creating the PeriodIndex. 

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
from weakref import WeakMethod

def cache_readonly(func):
    def wrapper(self):
        if hasattr(self, "_engine") and self._engine is not None:
            return self._engine
        else:
            weak_self = WeakMethod(self)
            self._engine = self._engine_type(weak_self, len(self))
            return self._engine
    return wrapper
```
