The error occurs when the `test_get_level_values_when_periods` function is executed. The error message indicates that the 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view', which occurs when the `is_monotonic_increasing` method is called.

The potential error location within the `_engine` function is likely the `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` line, where the `_engine_type` may not be returning a valid engine.

The bug occurs because the `_engine` function is not properly returning the expected engine type, leading to the AttributeError when the `is_monotonic_increasing` method is called.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should be modified to ensure that a valid engine is returned.

Below is the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
from weakref import ref

def _engine(self):
    period_ref = ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._values, len(self), ref=period_ref)
```

In this corrected code, the weak reference of `self` is passed to the `_engine_type`, and the `self._values` (assuming it's the valid attribute for engine creation) is used as the main data source for engine creation. This should address the issue and prevent the AttributeError from occurring when the engine methods are called.
