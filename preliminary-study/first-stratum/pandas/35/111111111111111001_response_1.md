The error occurs when the function `is_monotonic_increasing` is called, and it tries to access the attribute `view` on a `NoneType` object.

The method `_engine` returns `period` as a weak reference, and the instantiation of the `PeriodEngine` may not be properly handling the weak reference. This causes the `_engine` to return a `NoneType` object, leading to the error when `is_monotonic_increasing` tries to access the `view` attribute.

To fix this, we should modify the `_engine` method to properly instantiate the `PeriodEngine` without causing the weak reference to return a `NoneType`. 

Below is the corrected code for the `_engine` method:

```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This change should properly handle the weak reference and resolve the issue with the `NoneType` object being returned.
