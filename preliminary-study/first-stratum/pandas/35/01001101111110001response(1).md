The error message "AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'" indicates that the function `_engine` is returning `None` instead of the expected value. This is likely due to an issue with the logic inside the `_engine` function.

The potential error location within the `_engine` function is the return statement: `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not returning a valid object, causing the AttributeError in the test function.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should return a valid object of type `PeriodArray` and ensure that the `_engine` function correctly handles the input parameters and creates the expected object.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache
def _engine(self):
    return PeriodArray([period.asfreq("D") for period in self], dtype=self._dtype)
```
