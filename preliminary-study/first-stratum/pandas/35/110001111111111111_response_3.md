The error message indicates that the issue is related to the PeriodEngine's weak reference not being properly maintained, leading to a NoneType error.

The problem seems to be with the weak reference implementation in the _engine function. The weak reference to self is not being maintained properly, which causes the PeriodEngine to receive a NoneType instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, the weak reference should be properly implemented to ensure that a reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained.

Here's the corrected code for the _engine function:

```python
import weakref

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/pandas_35/pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Properly maintain a weak reference of self
    period = weakref.ref(self)  # Maintain a weak reference of self
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))  # Pass the weak reference to the _engine_type
```

The changes include calling the weak reference with parenthesis to get the referenced value, and passing the weak reference to the _engine_type function as intended. With these changes, the weak reference to the PeriodIndex should be properly maintained, and the NoneType error should be resolved.
