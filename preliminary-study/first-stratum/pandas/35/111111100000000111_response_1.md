Potential Error Location: The issue seems to be related to the weak reference of the PeriodIndex being dropped before intended, causing the PeriodEngine to receive None instead of the PeriodIndex.

Reasons behind the Bug: The weak reference to the PeriodIndex is not being properly managed, leading to it being dropped prematurely.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is being properly managed and not dropped prematurely.
2. Verify that the weak reference is being used correctly in the context of the _engine function.

Corrected Code:
```python
# this is the corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
