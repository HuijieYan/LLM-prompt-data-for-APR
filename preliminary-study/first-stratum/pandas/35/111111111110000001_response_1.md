1. The test function `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is checking whether an index constructed from Periods is monotonic. The error message suggests that the attribute `view` is being accessed by a `NoneType` object, indicating that the function `_engine` is probably not working correctly.

2. The potential error location is within the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class. This is based on the error message which indicates that the `NoneType` object is being accessed in a way that should be avoided.

3. The error may occur because the `_engine` function is returning a `NoneType` object instead of the expected engine type, leading to attribute errors when operations are performed on the returned object.

4. To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should be modified to return the correct engine type instead of a `NoneType` object. This can be achieved by ensuring that the `_engine_type` function is called with the correct parameters and that it returns an object of the expected type.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))  # Modify this line to pass the correct parameters
```

By ensuring that the correct parameters are passed to the `_engine_type` function and that it returns the expected object type, the bug should be fixed.
