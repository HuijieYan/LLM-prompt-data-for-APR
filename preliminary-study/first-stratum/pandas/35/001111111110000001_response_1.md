The test case is attempting to create a MultiIndex from Period objects and then check if the levels are monotonic. The error message indicates that there is an 'AttributeError' related to the 'view' attribute not being found on a 'NoneType' object.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the implementation of the '_engine' method in the 'PeriodIndex' class. The error is likely occurring because the '_engine_type' method is returning a 'NoneType' object instead of the expected type.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely related to an issue in the implementation of the '_engine' method. The method is expected to return the engine type associated with the PeriodIndex, but it may be failing to do so correctly, leading to a 'NoneType' object being returned.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that the '_engine' method returns the expected engine type, rather than a 'NoneType' object. This may involve checking the implementation of the '_engine_type' method and verifying that it returns the correct type.

Here's the corrected code for the '_engine' method:

```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine_type is None:
        # Handle the case where _engine_type returns None
        # This ensures that a valid engine type is always returned
        raise ValueError("_engine_type returned None")
    return engine_type
```
