The error message indicates that there is an issue with weak referencing and the PeriodEngine receiving a NoneType object instead of the expected PeriodIndex.

The potential error location is within the _engine function, where the weak reference to self is being created. It seems that the weakref.ref(self) is not capturing the reference to self properly.

The bug occurs because the weak reference to self is not being properly maintained, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving a NoneType object instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to self is being properly created and maintained within the _engine function.

Here's the corrected code for the _engine function:

```python
import weakref

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/pandas_35/pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    _weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(_weakref(), len(self))
```

By properly creating and maintaining the weak reference to self, the PeriodEngine will receive the expected PeriodIndex instead of a NoneType object, fixing the bug.
