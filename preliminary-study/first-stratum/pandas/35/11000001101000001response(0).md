The bug in the `_engine` function is likely due to the use of the `weakref.ref(self)` method. This method returns a weak reference to the object, but it needs to be dereferenced to obtain the actual object for further use. Additionally, the weak reference object `period` is not being used in the subsequent code, so there may be a misunderstanding in the original implementation.

To fix this bug, the weak reference `period` should be dereferenced, and it should be used to obtain the actual object before passing it to `self._engine_type`. Additionally, in the test function `test_get_level_values_when_periods`, the `MultiIndex` class is being used, but the `PeriodIndex` class has a `_engine` function that is being called for a weak reference to `self`, causing the bug.

The corrected code for the `_engine` function is as follows:

```python
import weakref

def _engine(self):
    # Dereference the weak reference to obtain the actual object
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In addition, the test function `test_get_level_values_when_periods` needs to be modified to use the corrected method.

```python
def test_get_level_values_when_periods():
    # GH33131. See also discussion in GH32669.
    # This test can probably be removed when PeriodIndex._engine is removed.
    from pandas import Period, PeriodIndex, MultiIndex

    idx = MultiIndex.from_arrays(
        [PeriodIndex([Period("2019Q1"), Period("2019Q2")], name="b")]
    )
    idx2 = MultiIndex.from_arrays(
        [idx.get_level_values(level) for level in range(idx.nlevels)]
    )
    assert all(x.is_monotonic for x in idx2.levels)
```
