The potential error location within the problematic function is the `_engine` method, specifically in the line `period = weakref.ref(self)`. The bug seems to be related to weak referencing and how it is used within the `_engine` method. 

The bug occurs because the weak reference to `self` is not actually being used within the `_engine` method, so when the `PeriodEngine` is created, it is expecting a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object, but it's receiving `None` instead.

To fix the bug, we can directly pass the weak reference of `self` to the `_engine_type` constructor, instead of creating a local weak reference variable within the `_engine` method. This ensures that the weak reference is properly used when creating the `PeriodEngine`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
```

By making this change, we ensure that the weak reference to `self` is passed to the `_engine_type` constructor, resolving the bug related to weak references.
