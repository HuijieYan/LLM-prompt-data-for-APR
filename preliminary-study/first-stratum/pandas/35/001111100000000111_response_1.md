The issue seems to be related to the weak reference of the `PeriodIndex` being dropped before it is intended to, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To address this issue, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained until it is no longer needed by the `PeriodEngine`. This can be achieved by modifying the `_engine` method to properly handle the weak reference.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    self._engine_weakref = period  # Store the weak ref to prevent it from being dropped prematurely
    return engine
```

In this corrected version, we store the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` in the `_engine_weakref` attribute of the `PeriodIndex` instance. This prevents the weak reference from being dropped before it is intended to.

By making this change, we ensure that the weak reference is maintained for as long as it is needed by the `PeriodEngine`, thus addressing the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
