Potential error location: The problem seems to be with the weak reference to the PeriodIndex being dropped before intended, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

Reasons behind the bug: The weak reference to the PeriodIndex is not being maintained properly, leading to it being dropped prematurely.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: One approach to fixing this bug would be to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained for the duration it is needed by the PeriodEngine.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/pandas_35/pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the fixed function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
