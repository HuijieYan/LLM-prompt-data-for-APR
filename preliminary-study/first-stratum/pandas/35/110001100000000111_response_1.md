The potential error location within the problematic function is the weakref creation and usage.

The weakref.ref(self) creates a weak reference to the object 'self', which is a PeriodIndex in this case. However, while trying to use 'period' in the return statement, it is not being properly dereferenced to get the actual object it refers to. This leads to 'period' being passed as None to self._engine_type, causing the error.

To fix this bug, we need to properly dereference the weak reference 'period' to get the actual object before passing it to self._engine_type.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/pandas_35/pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
