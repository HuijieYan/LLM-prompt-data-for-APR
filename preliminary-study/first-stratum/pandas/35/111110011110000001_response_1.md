The error message indicates an AttributeError when trying to access the 'view' attribute of a 'NoneType' object. This is occurring in the context of the PeriodIndex._engine method.

The most likely location of the bug is within the _engine method where the _engine_type is being called. It seems that the _engine_type is returning a 'NoneType' object instead of the expected type, causing the subsequent AttributeError.

The reason for the bug might be due to incorrect implementation or a failure to return the correct type from the _engine_type method. This is resulting in None being returned and causing the AttributeError.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that the _engine_type method returns the correct type. This may involve inspecting the _engine_type method to identify any issues causing it to return None. Additionally, a thorough review of the dependencies of the _engine method, especially the _engine_type, may be necessary to ensure correct behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic _engine method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine_type is not None:
        return engine_type
    else:
        raise ValueError("_engine_type returned None")
```
