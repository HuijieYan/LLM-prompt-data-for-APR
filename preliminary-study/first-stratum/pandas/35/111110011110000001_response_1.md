The error occurs in the `PeriodEngine` class, particularly in the `vgetter` method, where a `NoneType` object is being accessed for the `view` attribute.

The bug in the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class is likely the cause of the error. The `_engine` method is meant to return the engine (a `PeriodEngine` object) associated with the `PeriodIndex` instance.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` method should create and return a new instance of `PeriodEngine` or set an already existing instance of `PeriodEngine` as an attribute of the `PeriodIndex` class.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a new instance of PeriodEngine and return it
    return PeriodEngine(self, len(self))
```
