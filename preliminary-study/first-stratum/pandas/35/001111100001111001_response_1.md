The potential error is likely located in the _engine function. The use of the weakref.ref is not appropriate in this context, causing the code to fail when referencing the periods.

The use of weakref.ref is meant to create a weak reference to an object. However, in this context, it seems the intention is just to pass a reference to the PeriodIndex object.

To fix this bug, we can just pass the self object directly to the _engine_type constructor without using weakref.ref.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Pass a reference of self to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
