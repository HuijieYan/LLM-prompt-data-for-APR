The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the use of the `@cache_readonly` decorator, which is not a standard Python decorator. 

Since the decorator is not part of the standard Python library, it's likely that the bug is related to the implementation of this custom decorator.

To fix the bug, we can remove the `@cache_readonly` decorator and handle the caching logic manually.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

def _engine(self):
    if hasattr(self, '_cached_engine'):
        return self._cached_engine
    else:
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        self._cached_engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
        return self._cached_engine
```
