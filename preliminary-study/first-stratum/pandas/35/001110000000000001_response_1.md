Potential Error Location: The potential error is in the _engine function where the weak reference to 'self' is being used.

Reasons for the Bug: The use of weak reference to 'self' inside the _engine function can lead to the reference being garbage collected prematurely if there are no other strong references to the object.

Possible Approaches:
1. Use a strong reference instead of a weak reference to 'self' inside the _engine function to avoid premature garbage collection.
2. Consider whether using a weak reference is necessary in this context, and if not, remove the weak reference.

Corrected Code:
```python
# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use a strong reference instead of a weak reference to 'self'
    period = self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
