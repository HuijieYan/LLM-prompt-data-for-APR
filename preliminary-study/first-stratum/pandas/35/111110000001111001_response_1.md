The bug in the provided function is likely due to using the `weakref.ref` function incorrectly. The purpose of using `weakref.ref` is to create a weak reference to the `self` object to avoid reference cycles, but it is not being used properly in the given code.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should be modified to correctly create a weak reference to the `self` object and then use it to initialize the `_engine_type` class.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from weakref import ref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use weakref.ref to create a weak reference to self
    period_weakref = ref(self)
    # Initialize _engine_type with the weak reference
    return self._engine_type(period_weakref, len(self._values))
```

With this change, the `_engine` function should correctly create a weak reference to the `self` object and use it to initialize the `_engine_type` class, resolving the bug.
