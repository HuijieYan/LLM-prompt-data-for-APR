The error occurs because the `_engine` method is using a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object, but the weak reference is being dropped before intended. This results in the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`, leading to the AttributeError when trying to access the `view()` method on a `NoneType` object.

To fix this bug, the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object should be maintained until it is no longer needed.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from weakref import ref

# ...

class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    # ... other code ...

    # Fix the buggy function
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
In the corrected version, the weak reference to `PeriodIndex` is maintained until the `_engine_type` method is called. This should prevent the issue with the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped before intended.
