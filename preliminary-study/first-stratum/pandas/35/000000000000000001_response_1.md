The error in the provided code is that the `@cache_readonly` decorator is not defined, and it seems like it should be a custom decorator for caching the result of the `_engine` method.

To fix this, we can define the `@cache_readonly` decorator and use it to cache the result of the `_engine` method so that it is only computed once and then reused on subsequent calls.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    def inner(self, *args, **kwargs):
        if not hasattr(self, '_cache'):
            self._cache = {}
        if func.__name__ not in self._cache:
            self._cache[func.__name__] = func(self, *args, **kwargs)
        return self._cache[func.__name__]
    return inner

class SomeClass:
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))

# Usage
instance = SomeClass()
result1 = instance._engine()  # first call to _engine, it will compute and cache the result
result2 = instance._engine()  # subsequent call, it will return the cached result
```

In this corrected code, we define a `cache_readonly` decorator that caches the result of the decorated method. We then apply this decorator to the `_engine` method in the `SomeClass` class, so that the result of the `_engine` method is cached and reused on subsequent calls.
