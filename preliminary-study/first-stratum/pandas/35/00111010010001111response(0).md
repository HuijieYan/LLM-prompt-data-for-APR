The error occurs when the `is_monotonic` property is accessed, which ultimately leads to the `PeriodEngine` accessing a weakly referenced `PeriodIndex`, resulting in a `None` value instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, the `_engine` method needs to be modified to ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is not dropped prematurely.

One approach to fixing this issue is to modify the `_engine` method to use a weak reference and ensure that it is still valid when accessed. This can be achieved by using a conditional statement to check if the weak reference is still valid before accessing it.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    if period() is not None:
        return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
    else:
        # handle the case where the weak reference is no longer valid
        # you may raise an error, return a default value, or take other appropriate action
        pass
``` 

With this modification, the `_engine` method will first check if the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is still valid before accessing it, thus avoiding the issue of the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` value instead of the `PeriodIndex`.
