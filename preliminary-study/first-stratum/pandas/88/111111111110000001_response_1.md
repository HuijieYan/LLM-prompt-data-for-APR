The error occurs in the `test_pivot_table_multiindex_only` function. It fails with an AttributeError stating that 'Series' object has no attribute 'columns'. This error occurs when the `pivot_table` method is called in the test function.

The potential error location within the problematic function is when the `df2.pivot_table` method is called with the `columns` parameter.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `pivot_table` method is not handling the `columns` parameter correctly. It seems like the `columns` parameter values in the test function are being inferred as a Series object instead of a list or tuple.

In order to fix the bug, we need to handle the `columns` parameter properly in the `pivot_table` method, by ensuring that it is passed as a list or tuple.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc='mean',
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name='All',
    observed=False,
) -> 'DataFrame':
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)  # Modified to ensure columns is converted properly
    
    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        # ... omitted code ...
    
    keys = index + columns
    
    # ... omitted code ...
``` 

In the above corrected code, the `columns` parameter is passed through the `_convert_by` function to ensure that it is properly handled. This should resolve the issue encountered in the test function.
