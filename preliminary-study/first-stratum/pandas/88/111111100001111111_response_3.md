Based on the provided test cases and error messages, the issue seems to be occurring when using the `pivot_table` function with multi-index columns.

The error occurs when the code tries to access `table.columns.nlevels` when `table` is a Series object. The error message indicates that the 'Series' object has no attribute 'columns'. 

This error occurs because the code incorrectly assumes that `table` will always be a DataFrame. However, in the case of multi-index columns, `table` can be a Series instead of a DataFrame.

To fix this issue, the code should check the type of `table` before accessing its attributes. If `table` is a Series, the code should handle it accordingly. 

Here's the corrected code for the `pivot_table` function:

```python
def pivot_table(data, values=None, index=None, columns=None, aggfunc='mean', fill_value=None, margins=False, dropna=True, margins_name='All', observed=False) -> 'DataFrame':
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    # ... (omitted code for brevity)
    
    agged = grouped.agg(aggfunc)
    if isinstance(agged, ABCDataFrame) and len(agged.columns):
        agged.dropna(how="all", inplace=True)

    table = agged
    if isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame) and table.index.nlevels > 1:
        index_names = agged.index.names[:len(index)]

        # Handle the case where the index_names are integers
        to_unstack = []
        for i in range(len(index), len(keys)):
            name = agged.index.names[i]
            if name is None or name in index_names:
                to_unstack.append(i)
            else:
                to_unstack.append(name)
        table = agged.unstack(to_unstack)

    # ... (omitted code for brevity)

    return table
```

In the corrected code, the type of `table` is checked before accessing its attributes, and appropriate actions are taken based on whether `table` is a DataFrame or a Series. This should resolve the issue with the `pivot_table` function when using multi-index columns.
