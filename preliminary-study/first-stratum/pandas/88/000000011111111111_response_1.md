The error occurs when the function `pivot_table` is called with multi-index columns, resulting in an AttributeError because the function is trying to access the `nlevels` attribute on a Series object. This AttributeError is a result of the function treating the input `columns` as multi-index columns when the function is not designed to handle multi-index columns in this context.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle multi-index columns in a way that does not throw an AttributeError. We can achieve this by checking the type of the `columns` parameter and handling single-level and multi-level columns differently.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def pivot_table(...):
    # existing code

    if isinstance(columns, tuple):
        keys = list(columns)
    else:
        keys = [columns]

    # existing code

    if len(keys) > 1:
        to_unstack = []
        for i in range(len(index), len(keys)):
            name = agged.index.names[i]
            if name is None or name in index_names:
                to_unstack.append(i)
        table = agged.unstack(to_unstack)

    # existing code
```

In the corrected function, we first check if the `columns` parameter is a tuple, indicating multi-index columns. If it is, we convert it to a list of keys. Then, based on the number of keys, we handle the multi-index columns by unstacking the `agged` DataFrame.

This approach fixes the bug by properly handling multi-index columns and prevents the AttributeError from occurring.

This fix allows the function to handle multi-index columns for the `pivot_table` method when `columns` is provided as a tuple.

These changes should resolve the bug and allow the function to handle multi-index columns without throwing an AttributeError.
