The test case `test_pivot_table_multiindex_only` is testing the `pivot_table` method of the DataFrame class. It expects the method to pivot the data and create a multi-level index with the specified columns. However, the method is throwing an `AttributeError` related to the 'columns' attribute of a Series object.

The potential error location is in the `pivot_table` method, specifically in the section where the `aggfunc` parameter is used. This section contains recursive calls to the `pivot_table` method, which might lead to control never returning to the original call under certain conditions.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be the recursive nature of the function calls when `aggfunc` is a list, which might disrupt the flow of the method execution and cause unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, one possible approach is to refactor the handling of the `aggfunc` parameter to avoid the recursive calls. Instead of calling `pivot_table` within the loop, the individual aggregation results can be calculated without recursion and then concatenated at the end.

Here's the corrected code for the `pivot_table` function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        agg_results = {}
        for func in aggfunc:
            grouped = data.groupby(index + columns, observed=observed)
            agged = grouped.agg(func)
            agg_results[func.__name__] = agged

        table = concat(agg_results, axis=1)

    else:
        # rest of the implementation for non-list aggfunc

    # rest of the implementation for handling dropna, fill_value, margins, etc.

    return table
```
In the corrected code, when `aggfunc` is a list, the individual aggregation results are stored in a dictionary `agg_results` and then concatenated at the end to form the final result. This approach avoids the recursion issue and ensures the correct flow of the method execution.
