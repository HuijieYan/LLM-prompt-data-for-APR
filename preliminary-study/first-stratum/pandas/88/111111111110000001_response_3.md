The bug occurs in the `pivot_table` function when the `columns` parameter is provided as a tuple instead of a string or a list. This causes a Series to be returned instead of a DataFrame, resulting in an AttributeError when attempting to access the `columns` attribute.

The bug occurs because the code does not handle the case where `columns` is provided as a tuple. It assumes that `columns` will either be a string or a list, leading to the incorrect behavior for tuples.

To fix the bug, the `pivot_table` function needs to check the type of the `columns` parameter and handle the case where it is a tuple. It should convert the tuple to a list before processing it further.

Here's the corrected code for the `pivot_table` function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(columns, tuple):
        columns = list(columns)

    # rest of the function remains unchanged...
```

In the corrected code, an additional check is added to handle the case where `columns` is a tuple. If it is a tuple, it is converted to a list to ensure that subsequent processing works as expected.
