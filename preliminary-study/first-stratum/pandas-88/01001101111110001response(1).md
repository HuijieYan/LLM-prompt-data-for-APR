The error message indicates that the function is trying to access the 'columns' attribute of a 'Series' object, but 'Series' objects do not have a 'columns' attribute.

Looking at the function code, the error is likely to occur in the following section:

```python
values = data.columns
```

The variable 'values' is being assigned the value of 'data.columns', which is an Index type. However, later in the code, the function treats 'values' as a list, which is causing the issue. 

To fix this bug, the 'values' variable should be converted to a list before any list operations are performed on it.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    values = data.columns.tolist()  # Convert data columns to a list

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With this correction, the 'values' variable is converted to a list before any list operations are performed, which should resolve the error.
