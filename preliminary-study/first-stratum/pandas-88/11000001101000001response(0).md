The buggy function is `pivot_table` from the `pandas` library. It seems to be a recursive function, which calls itself for each `aggfunc` if `aggfunc` parameter is a list. However, it appears that the function is not handling the recursive call properly and is leading to a crash.

This could be happening due to the way the recursive call is made when `aggfunc` is a list. The function needs to be updated to handle recursive calls more robustly when `aggfunc` is a list.

The possible approaches for fixing the bug could be to handle the recursive call for each `aggfunc` appropriately, ensuring that the function doesn't fall into an infinite loop when `aggfunc` is a list. Another approach could involve separating out the functionality for handling multiple aggregation functions into a separate private helper method, making the code more modular and easier to maintain.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from pandas import DataFrame, MultiIndex, Index
from pandas.core.arrays.categorical import is_integer_dtype
from pandas.core.frame import DataFrame, DataFrameGroupBy
from pandas.core.generic import ABCDataFrame


def pivot_table(data, values=None, index=None, columns=None, aggfunc='mean', fill_value=None, margins=False, dropna=True, margins_name='All', observed=False) -> 'DataFrame':
    # add separate handling for aggfunc as list
    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            table = pivot_table(
                data,
                values=values,
                index=index,
                columns=columns,
                fill_value=fill_value,
                aggfunc=func,
                margins=margins,
                dropna=dropna,
                margins_name=margins_name,
                observed=observed,
            )
            pieces.append(table)
            keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        return concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)
    
    # rest of the original function's code...

```
In the corrected code, the function checks if `aggfunc` is a list and handles each function in the list, ensuring that the function doesn't call itself indefinitely. This is achieved by checking if `aggfunc` is a list and then processing each function in the list separately, storing the results in the `pieces` list and then concatenating them at the end.
