The issue arises from the `pivot_table` method when trying to pivot the DataFrame with multi-index columns. The error occurs because the method tries to access the `nlevels` attribute on a `Series` object, which does not have this attribute, causing an `AttributeError`.

To fix this issue, it's necessary to ensure that the `columns` attribute in the method is of the correct type before performing the attribute access. Additionally, the method should handle both single and multi-index column cases correctly.

Here's the corrected `pivot_table` method:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    if isinstance(columns, tuple):
        columns = list(columns)  # Convert to list for consistency

    # Rest of the function code remains the same
    # ...

    # Place the validation condition for columns after 'if isinstance(aggfunc, list):'

    if columns is not None and isinstance(columns, list) and len(columns) > 1:
        if values_passed and not values_multi and not table.empty:
            table = table[values[0]]

    # Rest of the function code remains the same

    return table
```

In the corrected function, an additional validation check is added to ensure that `columns` is a list and has more than one element. This check is placed in the location where the method tries to access the `nlevels` attribute, ensuring it is only accessed when applicable.
