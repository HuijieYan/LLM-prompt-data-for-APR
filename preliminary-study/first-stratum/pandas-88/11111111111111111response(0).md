The bug is occurring in the `pivot_table` function when called with multi-index columns. It raises an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `columns` attribute of a `Series` object.

The reason for the bug is that the `pivot_table` function is trying to access the `columns` attribute on a `Series` object, which does not have that attribute.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `pivot_table` function to handle the case of multi-index columns appropriately.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def pivot_table(data, values=None, index=None, columns=None, aggfunc='mean', fill_value=None, margins=False, dropna=True, margins_name='All', observed=False) -> 'DataFrame':
    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)

    # modify the 'if' condition that causes the AttributeError
    if values_passed and not values_multi and not table.empty:
        if isinstance(table, pd.DataFrame) and table.columns.nlevels > 1:
            table = table[values[0]]

    # ... (the rest of the function remains unchanged)
```

By explicitly checking if the `table` object is a DataFrame and has multiple levels in its columns, we can avoid the AttributeError when trying to access the `columns` attribute on a `Series` object.

With this correction, the `pivot_table` function should now handle the multi-index columns case correctly and prevent the AttributeError from occurring.

I hope this helps to fix the bug.
