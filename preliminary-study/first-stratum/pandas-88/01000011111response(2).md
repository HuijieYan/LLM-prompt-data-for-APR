1. The test case is attempting to use the `pivot_table` method with multi-index columns, but it's resulting in an AttributeError. The error is occurring when trying to access the `nlevels` attribute of the `table.columns`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is identified as the following line:
   ```python
   if values_passed and not values_multi and not table.empty and (table.columns.nlevels > 1):
   ```

3. The bug seems to be occurring because the `table.columns` is a Series object, and Series objects do not have a `nlevels` attribute. The function expects that `table.columns` will be a DataFrame object.

4. To fix the bug, we can modify the function to check whether `table.columns` is a DataFrame or a MultiIndex. If it's a MultiIndex, then we can use `nlevels` attribute to determine the number of levels.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function with the fix implemented:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # ... (existing code)

    keys = index + columns

    # ... (existing code)

    grouped = data.groupby(keys, observed=observed)
    agged = grouped.agg(aggfunc)
    if dropna and isinstance(agged, ABCDataFrame) and len(agged.columns):
        agged = agged.dropna(how="all")

    # ... (existing code)

    table = agged

    if hasattr(table.columns, "nlevels") and table.columns.nlevels > 1:
        # Modify the condition to check if table.columns has nlevels attribute
        # and use it accordingly

    # ... (existing code)

    if isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame):
        table = table.sort_index(axis=1)

    # ... (existing code)

    return table
```

In the corrected code, we've added a check using `hasattr` to see if `table.columns` has an attribute `nlevels`. If it does, then we use `nlevels` to determine the number of levels in the MultiIndex. If it doesn't, the condition will simply not be executed, avoiding the AttributeError.
