The buggy function fails to return a value for the variables at the end of the function. Additionally, the function seems to have a recursive call to itself which might be unnecessary and might cause an infinite loop.

The potential issues in the function are the unnecessary recursive call and the failure to return a value at the end of the function.

To fix the bug, the unnecessary recursive call to `pivot_table` within the `pivot_table` function should be removed. Additionally, a return statement should be added at the end of the `pivot_table` function to return the `table` variable, which is the expected output of the function.

The corrected code for the `pivot_table` function is as follows:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged

    return table
```

By removing the unnecessary recursive call and adding a return statement at the end, the function should return the expected output and resolve the bug.
