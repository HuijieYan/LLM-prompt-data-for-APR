The bug occurs in the `copy` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi.contrib.redshift` module. The error occurs on this line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
The reason for the bug is that when `self.columns` is `None`, the code attempts to call `len` on it, which results in a `TypeError`.

To fix the bug, we can check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. We can use the `and` operator for this purpose.

Here's the corrected `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, the code checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring.
