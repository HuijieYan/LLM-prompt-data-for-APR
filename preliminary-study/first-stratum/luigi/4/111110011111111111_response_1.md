The error occurs in the `copy` method of the class `S3CopyToTable`. The main issue is that when `self.columns` is `None`, the code attempts to check the length of `None` which leads to the error.

To fix this issue, we can modify the condition to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length. This can be achieved using the `is not None` comparison.

Below is the corrected code for the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """

    
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length, we prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring. This change should fix the issue and allow the `COPY` operation to work correctly in cases where `columns` is `None`.
