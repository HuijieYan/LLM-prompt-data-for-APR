The error is occurring inside the `copy` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class. The error message indicates that the program is trying to get the length of `self.columns`, which is None. This is happening because the code is checking if the length of `self.columns` is greater than 0 without first checking if `self.columns` is not None.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the condition to check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In this corrected code, the condition `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0` ensures that it first checks if `self.columns` is not None before trying to access its length.

This should resolve the TypeError that was occurring and allow the Redshift COPY job to run successfully, even when `self.columns` is set to None.
