1. The error message indicates a 'TypeError' due to the use of the 'len' function on a object of type 'NoneType'. This suggests that the 'columns' attribute is expected to be a sequence (e.g., list, tuple) but is instead 'None'.

2. The potential error location within the 'copy' method is the line where the length of the 'columns' attribute is checked using 'len'.

3. The bug occurred because the 'copy' method assumes the 'columns' attribute to be a sequence, and the length check using 'len' leads to a 'TypeError' when 'columns' is 'None'.

4. One approach to fixing the bug is to add a check for 'None' before using the 'len' function. If 'columns' is 'None', then the 'colnames' variable should be set accordingly to handle this case.

5. Here's the corrected code for the 'copy' function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the 'copy' function checks if 'self.columns' is not 'None' before attempting to determine the 'colnames' to use in the SQL statement. If 'self.columns' is 'None', 'colnames' remains an empty string.
