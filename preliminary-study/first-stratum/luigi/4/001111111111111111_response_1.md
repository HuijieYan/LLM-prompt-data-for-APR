The error occurs in the `copy` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class. The line causing the error is `if len(self.columns) > 0:`. This line tries to check the length of `self.columns`, but if `self.columns` is `None`, it will raise a TypeError.

The reason for the bug is that the code does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` properly. It assumes that `self.columns` will always be a list with elements, but it is possible for it to be `None`.

To fix the bug, we should first check if `self.columns` is not `None`, and then proceed to check its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, we can treat it as an empty list.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length, we prevent the TypeError from occurring when `self.columns` is `None`.
