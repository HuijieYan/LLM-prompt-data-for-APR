Potential error:
The `cursor.execute` statement is using `self.copy_options` without calling it as a function, which may cause a TypeError.

Reason behind the bug:
The `self.copy_options` should be called as a function to return the options for the `COPY` command.

Approach for fixing the bug:
Call the `self.copy_options` as a function to return the options for the `COPY` command.

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """

    
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```
