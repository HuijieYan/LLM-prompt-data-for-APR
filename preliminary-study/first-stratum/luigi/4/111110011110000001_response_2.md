The error occurs in the `copy` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class. The error message indicates that 'object of type 'NoneType' has no len()', which means the `self.columns` attribute is of type 'NoneType' and cannot be used as a sequence with the `len` function. This is likely causing the error when the `len(self.columns)` check is being performed.

To fix this issue, a conditional check for `None` should be added before the length check to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. Additionally, if `self.columns` is `None`, the `colnames` variable can be assigned as an empty string.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check for None before using len
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected code, I added a check for `None` before using `len(self.columns)`. If `self.columns` is `None`, the `colnames` variable is assigned an empty string by default.

This fix should address the issue of the `NoneType` error when running the `copy` method.
