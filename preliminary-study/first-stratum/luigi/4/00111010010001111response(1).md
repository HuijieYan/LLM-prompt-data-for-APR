The issue is occurring due to the check for the length of the columns attribute being performed incorrectly, leading to a TypeError when columns are None. The problematic function is the `copy` method inside the `S3CopyToTable` class.

To fix this bug, the conditional check for the length of the columns attribute should be modified to handle the case when columns are None. The check should be updated to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With this modification, the `copy` method should now handle the case when the columns attribute is None and prevent the TypeError from occurring.
