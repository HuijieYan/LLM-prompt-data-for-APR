Potential error location: The error is likely to be in the `cursor.execute` statement due to the way the SQL query is formatted. 

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect formatting of the SQL query string. The `colnames` variable is not being handled properly, and the `creds` and `options` variables are not being formatted correctly within the query string.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the `colnames` variable is handled correctly and formatted as part of the query string.
2. Format the `creds` and `options` variables correctly within the query string.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}' 
     {options};
     """.format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
