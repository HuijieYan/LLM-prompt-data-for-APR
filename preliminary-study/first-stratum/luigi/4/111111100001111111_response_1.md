The potential error location within the problematic function is the `if len(self.columns) > 0` statement, which is causing the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error when `self.columns` is None.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code does not handle the case where `self.columns` is None, resulting in a TypeError when trying to find the length of None.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is None by checking if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
        
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """

        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # handle the case where self.columns is None
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the code does not attempt to find the length of None, resolving the TypeError.
