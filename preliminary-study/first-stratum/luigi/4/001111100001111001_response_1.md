Potential error location: 
The error is likely in the `cursor.execute` line where the `self.copy_options` attribute is not being called as a function, causing a TypeError.

Reasons behind the bug:
The `self.copy_options` attribute is not being called as a function, and it should likely return a string of copy options.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
Call the `copy_options` attribute as a function to return a string of copy options.

Corrected code:
```python
# this is the corrected function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())  # Call copy_options as a function
    )
```
