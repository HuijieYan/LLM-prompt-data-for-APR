Potential Error Location: The error is likely occurring in the `copy` function where the `cursor.execute` method is being used to execute a SQL query.

Reason for the Bug: The bug is likely occurring because the `copy_options` and `_credentials` methods are not being called properly. Also, the `copy_options` method is missing parentheses, so it is not being called as a function.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Call the `copy_options` and `_credentials` methods as functions.
2. Ensure that the `copy_options` method is called correctly by adding parentheses.
3. Check if the `columns` attribute is properly defined before using it.

Corrected Code:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```
