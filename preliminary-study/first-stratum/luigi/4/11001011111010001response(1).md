The error message "TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()" indicates that the code is trying to get the length of a variable that is of type 'None'. This aligns with the information provided in the input parameter values and types for the buggy function.

The issue is likely occurring in the following lines of code:
```python
colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
```
Since the input parameter `self.columns` is of type 'None', it is causing the TypeError when the code tries to get the length of it.

To fix the bug, a check for None type should be added before attempting to use the `self.columns` variable. If `self.columns` is None, an empty string should be assigned to `colnames`.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected code, a check for None type is added for `self.columns`. If `self.columns` is not None, it proceeds with the original logic. Otherwise, it assigns an empty string to `colnames`. Additionally, `self.copy_options` is called as a method `self.copy_options()` as indicated in the original code.
