The potential error in the `copy` function is the if condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` which assumes that `self.columns` is not None. This assumption leads to an error when `self.columns` is None, as it cannot be used in the len() function.

The bug occurs because the code does not handle the case when `self.columns` is None. This causes an error when trying to access the length of `self.columns`.

To fix the bug, we should check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to access its length.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """

    
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
