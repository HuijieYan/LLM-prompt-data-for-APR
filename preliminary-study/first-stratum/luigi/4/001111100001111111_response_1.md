The potential error location within the code is the line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
This line is causing the TypeError because when `self.columns` is `None`, it cannot be checked for its length.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the code is not handling the scenario when `self.columns` is `None`.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
        
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` condition, we are checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length, thus avoiding the TypeError.
