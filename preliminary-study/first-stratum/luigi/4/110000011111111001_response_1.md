The error occurs when the function tries to find the length of `self.columns` variable, but it is `None` which doesn't support the `len()` function. This is in line with the input parameter `columns=None` in the test case.

The potential error location is in the line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```

The reason behind the bug is that the function does not handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.

To fix the bug, we can first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before applying the `len()` function.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
In the corrected code, we added the check `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0` before processing `self.columns`. This will prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring previously.
