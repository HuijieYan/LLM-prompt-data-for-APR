Potential error: The potential error in the function is the missing closing parenthesis for the cursor.execute() method call. This is causing a syntax error.

Reason for the bug: The bug occurred because the closing parenthesis for the cursor.execute() method call was missing, causing a syntax error in the function.

Approach for fixing the bug: Add the closing parenthesis for the cursor.execute() method call at the end of the statement.

Corrected code:

```python
# Corrected function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )  # Added the closing parenthesis for cursor.execute() at the end
```
