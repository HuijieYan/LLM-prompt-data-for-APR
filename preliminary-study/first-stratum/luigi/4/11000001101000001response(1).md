Potential error location: In the line `creds=self._credentials()`, the method is being called as a function, and this could be causing issues.

Reasons for the bug: The `_credentials` method is being called incorrectly, which might be causing issues. Additionally, the `self.copy_options` attribute seems to be incorrectly used, as it should be a method, but it's being called as a variable.

Approach to fix the bug: Change the `self._credentials()` method call to `self._credentials` to pass the method reference. Additionally, if `self.copy_options` is also a method, make sure to call it as `self.copy_options()`.

Here's the modified code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials,
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```
