The potential error in the buggy function is with the `cursor.execute` statement. The formatting of the query string might be causing issues, and the `colnames` variable might not be handled correctly when it's empty.

The bug is occurring because the `colnames` variable is being defined as an empty string, and the condition to add it to the query string is not being handled properly. This is causing syntax errors in the SQL query when `colnames` is empty.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `colnames` is empty and not include it in the query string if it has no values. We can do this by checking if `colnames` is not empty before including it in the `COPY` query.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    copy_query = """
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames if colnames else '',
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    
    cursor.execute(copy_query)
```

In the corrected code, we check if `self.columns` has values before constructing the `colnames` string. We then use the `colnames` variable only if it's not empty when constructing the `COPY` query. This ensures that the query string is properly formatted, regardless of whether `colnames` has values or not.
