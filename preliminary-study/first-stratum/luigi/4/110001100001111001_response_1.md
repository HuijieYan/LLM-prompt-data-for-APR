The potential error in the provided function is in the `cursor.execute` statement. It seems that `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options` are not being called correctly. Also, there is a missing close parenthesis in `colnames` assignment.

The bug occurred due to the incorrect usage of the `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options`. These should be called as methods, but they are being used as attributes.

To fix the bug, we need to call the `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options()` methods and also fix the syntax error in the `colnames` assignment.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```
