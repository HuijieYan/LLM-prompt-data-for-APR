Potential error location: The error seems to be in the cursor.execute() statement, where the 'options' parameter is being passed as a method instead of a string. This is because the 'self.copy_options' is missing the function call parentheses '()' which results in passing the function reference itself rather than its return value. 

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the 'self.copy_options' is not being called as a function, and its return value (which is expected to be a string) is not being passed to the 'options' parameter in the cursor.execute() statement.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Call the 'self.copy_options' as a function to get its return value and then pass that value to the 'options' parameter in the cursor.execute() statement.
2. Ensure that the 'self.copy_options' function returns a string, as expected by the cursor.execute() statement.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """

    
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())  # Call the function to get its return value
    )
```
