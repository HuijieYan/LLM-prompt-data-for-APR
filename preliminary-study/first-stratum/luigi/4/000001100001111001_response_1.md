The potential error in the `copy` function is with the `colnames` variable being defined but not used. Also, there is an issue with the `self.copy_options` as it should be a method call `self.copy_options()` instead of just `self.copy_options`.

To fix these issues, we need to make the following changes:
1. Use the `colnames` variable in the `COPY` query.
2. Call the `self.copy_options` method instead of just referring to it.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
    COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
    CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
    {options}
    ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With these changes, the `colnames` variable is now being utilized in the `COPY` query, and `self.copy_options` is correctly called as a method.
