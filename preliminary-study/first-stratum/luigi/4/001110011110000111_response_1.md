The error occurs because the function `copy` is checking the length of `self.columns` without first checking if `self.columns` is not None. This causes a TypeError when trying to get the length of a NoneType object.

To fix this bug, we should check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected code, we added a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to ensure `self.columns` is not None before checking its length. This will prevent the TypeError from occurring when `self.columns` is None.
