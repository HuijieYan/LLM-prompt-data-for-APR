The error occurs in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class. The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError` because the `len(self.columns)` is being called when `self.columns` is set to `None`.

The potential error location in the code is the line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```

The reason for the bug is that if `self.columns` is set to `None`, the `len()` function cannot be called on it, resulting in a `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, we can modify the line to check if `self.columns` is not None before calling `len()` on it. The correct code for this check would be:
```python
if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
```

Here's the corrected `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
