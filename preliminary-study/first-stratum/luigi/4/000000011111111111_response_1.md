The error occurs on line 356 of the provided buggy function `copy`, where it is trying to find the length of `self.columns`, which is None. This is causing the TypeError.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to find its length.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` condition, we are ensuring that we only try to find the length of `self.columns` when it is not None.

This fix should address the TypeError and allow the function to work properly, especially when `self.columns` is None.
