The potential error in the `copy` method is that `copy_options` is not being called as a function. It is missing the parentheses after `self.copy_options`. This causes `copy_options` to be treated as a string instead of a function, leading to a TypeError.

To fix this bug, we need to call `self.copy_options()` to properly execute the function and retrieve the copy options.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())  # call copy_options as a function
    )
```
