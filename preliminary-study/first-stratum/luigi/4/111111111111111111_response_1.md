The error is occurring because the `self.columns` attribute is set to `None` in the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` object, and the buggy function doesn't handle this case properly.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before accessing its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In this corrected code, we added a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. If it is `None`, the rest of the code will be skipped, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring.
