The error occurs in the `copy` method of the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` class. The error message indicates that the `NoneType` object has no length, which suggests that the `self.columns` attribute is `None` and is being used in a comparison operation. This is consistent with the buggy case 1 input parameter `columns=None`.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `copy` method to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` and avoid comparing its length directly.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In this corrected code, we added a check for `self.columns` to ensure it exists and is not `None` before attempting to access its length. This modification will prevent the TypeError from occurring when `self.columns` is `None`.
