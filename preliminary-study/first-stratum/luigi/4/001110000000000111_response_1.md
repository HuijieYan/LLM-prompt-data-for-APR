The potential error location within the problematic function is the following line:

```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code assumes `self.columns` is always a list, and it tries to get its length without checking if it's `None` or not.

To fix the bug, we should first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s",f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```
