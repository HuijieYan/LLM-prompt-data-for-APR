The potential error in the `copy` function is that the `copy_options` method is not being called. This is evident from the line `options=self.copy_options`, where `copy_options` should be a method call, not just a reference to the method.

The bug occurred because the `copy_options` method was not being called to retrieve the options for the `COPY` command. Instead, the reference to the method was being passed as the options, which is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options` method and pass its return value as the options for the `COPY` command.

Here is the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """

    
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute(
        """
        COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
        CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
        {options}
        ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options()
        )
    )
```
