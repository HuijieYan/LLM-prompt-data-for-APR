The test case is attempting to run a method called `run()` on an instance of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey`. This method calls the `copy()` method with a `cursor` and a `path`. Within the `copy()` method, it is trying to check the length of `self.columns`, but it is failing because `self.columns` is `None`, and we cannot call `len()` on a `None` type.

The reason for the bug is that the `copy()` method is assuming `self.columns` will always be a list, but it is not handling the case where it might be `None`. 

To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. If it is `None`, then we should default `colnames` to an empty string.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy()` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected code, we check if `self.columns` is not `None` before using it to construct `colnames`. If it is `None`, then we default `colnames` to an empty string.
