Potential error location: The error is occurring in the `copy` method when it's trying to calculate the length of `self.columns`. 

Reason for the bug: The error message indicates that `self.columns` is of type `NoneType`, meaning it's `None` and therefore does not have a length, resulting in a `TypeError`.

Possible approach to fix the bug: Check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to calculate its length.

Corrected code:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
    COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
    CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
    {options}
    ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected code includes a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to calculate its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, the code inside the `if` statement will be skipped, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring.
