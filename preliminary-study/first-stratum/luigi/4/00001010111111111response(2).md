The error occurs in the `copy` function due to the comparison `if len(self.columns) > 0` where `self.columns` is `None`. This comparison causes a `TypeError` since you cannot take the length of a `None` type.

To fix the bug, you can modify the condition to explicitly check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the `self.columns` check before checking its length, we ensure that the code does not attempt to take the length of a `None` type. This should resolve the `TypeError` issue described in the test case and the associated issue.
