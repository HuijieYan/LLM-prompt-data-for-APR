The error occurs in the `copy` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `redshift.py` file. The error is caused by trying to get the length of `self.columns` when it is `None`, leading to a `TypeError`.

To fix this issue, you can simply check if `self.columns` has a value before trying to get its length. If it is `None`, then it should not attempt to get the length.

Here's the corrected `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """

    
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `if` statement checks if `self.columns` has a value before attempting to get its length. If it is `None`, then it will not try to get the length and will skip constructing the `colnames` variable.
