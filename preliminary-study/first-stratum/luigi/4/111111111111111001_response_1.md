The error occurs because the `copy` method is trying to access the `len` function on the `self.columns` attribute, which is set to `None` when the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task is instantiated with `columns=None`.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Handle the case when self.columns is None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In this corrected code, we added a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, then `colnames` remains an empty string without trying to access its length.
