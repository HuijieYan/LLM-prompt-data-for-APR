The error occurs when the `len` function is called on `self.columns`, which is `None`. This causes a `TypeError` since `None` does not have a length. 

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and provide a default value for `colnames`. 

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    # Handling the case when self.columns is None
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ""
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. If it is not `None`, we proceed with the existing logic to create `colnames`. If it is `None`, we just assign an empty string to `colnames`. This change prevents the `TypeError` that occurred due to the comparison of `None` with an int in the original code.
