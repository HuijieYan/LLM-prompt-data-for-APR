The issue seems to be related to the way the `copy_options` variable is being used in the `copy` function. The `copy_options` is expected to be a method or a callable that returns a string, but it is being used as a variable directly. This is likely causing an error in the `execute` call.

To fix this, the `copy_options` variable should be called like a method to get the string value, and then it should be passed to the `execute` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    if callable(self.copy_options):  # Check if copy_options is a method before calling it
        options = self.copy_options()
    else:
        options = self.copy_options

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=options  # Pass options instead of self.copy_options
    )
)
```

In this corrected code, the `self.copy_options` is first checked to see if it's callable, and if it is, it's called like a method to get the string value. Then, that value is used in the `cursor.execute` call. This approach ensures that the correct value is passed to the `execute` function, whether `copy_options` is a method or a string.
