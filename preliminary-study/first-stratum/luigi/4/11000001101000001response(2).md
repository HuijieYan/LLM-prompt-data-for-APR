The likely error in the provided function `copy` is in the line `options=self.copy_options`, as `self.copy_options` should be called as a method, not just referenced.

The reason for the bug is that the `self.copy_options` is not being called as a method. This is likely due to a missing `()` after `self.copy_options`.

To fix the bug, add the parentheses to `self.copy_options`. Additionally, include a check for `None` before attempting to join the columns, to avoid an error when `self.columns` is `None`.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In this corrected code:
- `self.copy_options` is now called as a method by using `self.copy_options()`.
- A check for `None` has been added before trying to join the columns.
