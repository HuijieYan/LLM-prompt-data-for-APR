Potential error location: The if statement using `len(self.columns) > 0` is causing the TypeError when `self.columns` is None.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the code does not check if `self.columns` is None before trying to get its length.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: We can fix the bug by checking if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length.

Corrected code:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
        
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """

        
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```
