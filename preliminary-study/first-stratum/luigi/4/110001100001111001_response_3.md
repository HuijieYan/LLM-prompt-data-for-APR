Potential Error Location:
The potential error is in the cursor.execute() method. 
The error might be occurring due to the incorrect use of the self._credentials() and self.copy_options variables.

Reason for Bug:
1. The self._credentials() and self.copy_options are not being called correctly within the cursor.execute() method.
2. Additionally, the options variable is not being called as a method.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the self._credentials() and self.copy_options are called as methods within the cursor.execute() method.
2. Check the usage of options variable and ensure it is called as a method.

Corrected Code:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(), 
        options=self.copy_options())  # corrected the usage of options as a method 
    )
```
In the corrected code, the usage of self._credentials() and self.copy_options() as methods within the cursor.execute() method has been fixed. Additionally, the options variable is now called as a method.
