The error occurs because the `columns` attribute of the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` object is `None`, and the code is attempting to calculate its length with `len(self.columns)`. Since `None` does not have a length, it results in a `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` and set `colnames` accordingly. We can check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to calculate its length.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In this corrected code, we first check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to calculate its length. If it is not None, we proceed with the same logic as before. If it is None, we simply leave `colnames` as an empty string. Additionally, when calling `self.copy_options`, we need to include parentheses to call the method.
