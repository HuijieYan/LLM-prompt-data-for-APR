The error occurs at the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:`. It's a `TypeError` because `self.columns` is `None` and we are performing a length check on it. The `columns` parameter is passed as `None` in the test case `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns`. 

To fix this, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before performing a length check. If `self.columns` is not `None`, then proceed with the length check and building the `colnames` string. If `self.columns` is `None`, then `colnames` will also be `None`.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = None
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames if colnames is not None else '',
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, the code will first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length, resolving the `TypeError` that occurred.
