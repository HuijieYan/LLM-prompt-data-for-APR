1. The error message indicates that the bug is likely in the `copy` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file.
2. The potential error location is within the conditional statement `if len(self.columns) > 0:` in the `copy` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class.
3. The reason for the bug is that the `columns` attribute of the `S3CopyToTable` class is set to `None`, and the `len(None)` operation throws a TypeError.
4. One possible approach for fixing the bug is to check if the `columns` attribute is not `None` before attempting to find its length. This can be achieved by changing the condition from `if len(self.columns) > 0:` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`.

```python
# Corrected copy method
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if columns is not None before finding its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the conditional statement in the `copy` method checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length, preventing the TypeError.
