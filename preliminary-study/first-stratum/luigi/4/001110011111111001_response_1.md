The error occurs in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class. The error message indicates that the `TypeError` is caused by trying to get the length of `NoneType`. This implies that the `self.columns` is None, resulting in an error when trying to access its length.

The bug occurs because the `copy` function does not handle the case where `self.columns` is None. It assumes that `self.columns` will always have a value.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to access its length. If it is None, we can set `colnames` to an empty string.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected code, we first check if `self.columns` is not None. If it is not None, we proceed to construct the `colnames` string as before. If it is None, we set `colnames` to an empty string. This will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when trying to access the length of `NoneType`.
