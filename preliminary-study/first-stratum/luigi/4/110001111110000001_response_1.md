Potential error location:
The error occurs in the `copy` method when checking the length of `self.columns`. Since the `columns` parameter is set as `None` in the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` class, it raises a `TypeError` when the length is checked in the `copy` method.

Reasons behind the bug:
The `TypeError` is occurring because the `colnames` variable is set based on the length of `self.columns` without handling the case when `self.columns` is `None`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and set `colnames` accordingly. This can be done using an `if` condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before setting `colnames` based on its length.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
