The error occurs in the `copy` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class. The error message indicates that the `TypeError` is occurring at line 338, where it is trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which is of type `NoneType`.

The reason behind the bug is that the `if` condition is trying to check the length of `self.columns` without first checking if `self.columns` is `None`. This is leading to the `TypeError` when it tries to evaluate `len(None)`.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to check its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, then we can assume that there are no columns, and in that case, we can skip the creation of the `colnames` string.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to see if `self.columns` is not `None` before creating the `colnames` string. This check will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when `self.columns` is `None`.
