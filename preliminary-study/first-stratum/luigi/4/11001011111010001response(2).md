The error message "TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()" suggests that the code is trying to perform the len() operation on a NoneType object, which is not allowed in Python.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the following line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
The variable `self.columns` is not checked for NoneType before calling len() on it, which leads to the TypeError.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that `self.columns` is not properly handled and can be None when the columns are not specified in the task.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to check if `self.columns` is not None before calling len() on it. If `self.columns` is None, the length of the columns would be 0.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected code, `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` checks if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to find its length. If `self.columns` is None, the code inside the if block will not be executed, preventing the TypeError.
