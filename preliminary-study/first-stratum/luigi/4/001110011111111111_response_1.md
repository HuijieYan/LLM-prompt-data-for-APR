Potential error location:
The error is occurring at the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The error occurs because in the test case, the `columns` attribute of the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` instance is set to `None`. In the `copy` function, it checks the length of `self.columns`, and since it is set to `None`, the error occurs.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
One possible approach to fix the bug is to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

```python
# Corrected copy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, the `copy` function will first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length. This will prevent the TypeError when `columns` is `None`.
