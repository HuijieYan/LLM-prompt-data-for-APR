Potential error location:
The error is likely occurring in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` because it does not check if `self.columns` is None before attempting to get its length.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the code is trying to get the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is None. This causes a TypeError when `self.columns` is None.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length. We can do this by using `if self.columns` before checking the length.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
