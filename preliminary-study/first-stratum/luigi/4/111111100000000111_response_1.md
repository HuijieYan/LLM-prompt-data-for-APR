The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional check for the length of the columns: 

```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the code does not handle the case when the `columns` attribute is None. This results in a TypeError when trying to get the length of None.

To fix the bug, the code should be updated to check if `self.columns` exists and has a value before trying to get its length.

The corrected code for the problematic function is:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns exists and has a value
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
