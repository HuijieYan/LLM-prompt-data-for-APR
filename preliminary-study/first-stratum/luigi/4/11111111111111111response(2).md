1. The test case test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns uses a task called DummyS3CopyToTableKey with the columns set to None, which is causing the TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len() error.
2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the copy method where it checks the length of self.columns, which will cause an error if self.columns is None.
3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code is directly checking the length of self.columns without first checking if self.columns is not None.
4. To fix the bug, we can modify the code to check if self.columns is not None before checking its length, and provide a default empty string if self.columns is None.
5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected code, we first check if self.columns is not None before checking its length. If it's not None, then we proceed to check its length and construct the colnames accordingly. If it's None, we simply assign an empty string to colnames. This should fix the bug and prevent the TypeError from occurring.
