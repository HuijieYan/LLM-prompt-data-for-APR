The error is occurring in the 'copy' function within the 'S3CopyToTable' class. More specifically, the error is due to the line 'if len(self.columns) > 0:', where 'self.columns' is a 'NoneType' object, hence it cannot be used with the 'len' function.

The reason for this bug is that the 'copy' function assumes that 'self.columns' will always be a non-empty list when checking its length. However, in the test case provided, 'task' is initialized with 'columns=None', which causes the 'if len(self.columns) > 0:' condition to throw a TypeError.

To fix this bug, we should modify the 'copy' function to first check if 'self.columns' is not None before attempting to use it. If 'self.columns' is None, then the 'colnames' variable should also be set to an empty string.

Here's the corrected code for the 'copy' function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected code, the 'if' condition checks if 'self.columns' exists and only then proceeds to check its length. If 'self.columns' is None, then 'colnames' is set to an empty string directly.
