The test case is set up to test the `S3CopyToTable` class and its `copy` method. It sets the `columns` attribute to `None` and then calls the `run` method of the `S3CopyToTable` instance.

The error occurs in the `copy` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class. It tries to check the length of `self.columns`, which leads to a `TypeError` because when `self.columns` is `None`.

The reason behind the bug is that the `copy` method does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `copy` method to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. We can check if `self.columns` is not `None` before performing any operations on it.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected code, a check for `self.columns` being not `None` is added before attempting to get its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, `colnames` is set to an empty string. Otherwise, it proceeds as before.
