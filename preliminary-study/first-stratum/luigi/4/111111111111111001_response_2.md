The error occurs in the `copy` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi.contrib.redshift` module. The specific error message is `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`. This error occurs when attempting to get the length of `self.columns`. 

The reason for the error is that the `self.columns` attribute is set to `None`, and the code does not handle this case properly. The code attempts to check the length of `self.columns`, assuming it is a list or another iterable, but it fails when `self.columns` is `None`.

To fix this bug, the code needs to explicitly handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to get its length.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected code, we added a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. This fix should prevent the `TypeError` from occurring and handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.
