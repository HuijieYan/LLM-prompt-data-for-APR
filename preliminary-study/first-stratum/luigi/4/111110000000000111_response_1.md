The potential error location within the problematic function is in the following lines:

```python
colnames = ''
if len(self.columns) > 0:
    colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
    colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
```

The error occurs because the code tries to get the length of `self.columns` without first checking if it is not None. When `self.columns` is None, the code raises a TypeError because `NoneType` has no length.

To fix this bug, the code should first check if `self.columns` is not None before getting its length.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """

    
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

The corrected code includes the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to ensure that the code only tries to get the length of `self.columns` when it is not None. This should resolve the TypeError issue when `self.columns` is None.
