Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the provided function is in the line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
This line assumes that `self.columns` is always a list or iterable, which may not be the case.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The error occurs because the code does not check if `self.columns` is None before attempting to check its length. If `self.columns` is None, then calling len(self.columns) will result in a TypeError.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
The code should first check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length. This can be done using an if statement. If `self.columns` is None, then the colnames variable should also be set to an empty string.

Corrected Code:
```python
# corrected code for the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
        
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
In the corrected code, we have added a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to ensure that `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length. This prevents the TypeError that was occurring in the original code.
