The error occurs because the `self.columns` attribute is set to `None`, and the code is trying to check the length of a `None` type object. 

To fix the bug, the `copy` function needs to be modified to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. Also, the `copy_options` function should be called instead of using `self.copy_options` as a property.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
        
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

In the corrected code, we added a condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. We also changed `self.copy_options` to `self.copy_options()` to call the function instead of accessing it as a property.
