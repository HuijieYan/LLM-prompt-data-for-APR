Potential Error:
The issue seems to be with the `cursor.execute` statement. The `copy_options` should be a method and not a property, and hence it should be called as a method by adding parentheses `self.copy_options()`.

Reason for Bug:
The `options=self.copy_options` in the `cursor.execute` statement is likely causing the bug because `self.copy_options` should be called as a method but it is being treated as a property.

Approach to Fix:
Change `options=self.copy_options` to `options=self.copy_options()` in the `self.copy` method.

Corrected Code:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())  # Fixed the call to copy_options as a method
    )
```
