The error is caused by the fact that the buggy function is assuming that `self.columns` will always have a value, but it is possible for `self.columns` to be empty or None. This causes the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` during the `if len(self.columns) > 0` check.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` exists and has a value before trying to get its length.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
        
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In this corrected code, we are first checking if `self.columns` exists and has a value before trying to get its length. If it does, then we proceed to construct the `colnames` string. If not, we simply set `colnames` to an empty string.

This fix should prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when `self.columns` is None or empty.
