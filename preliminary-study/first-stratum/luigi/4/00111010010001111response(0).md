The error is occurring at the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` in the `copy` function. This is because when `columns` is `None`, the comparison `if len(self.columns) > 0:` will raise a `TypeError` as `None` does not have a `len` method.

To fix this issue, you can update the line to explicitly check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to check its length. This can be done with the following code:

```python
if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
```

This change ensures that the length of `self.columns` is only checked if it is not `None`.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```
