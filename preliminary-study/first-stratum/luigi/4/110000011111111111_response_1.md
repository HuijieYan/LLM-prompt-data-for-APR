The error occurs because the code is trying to retrieve the length of "self.columns" without checking if it is not None. This leads to a TypeError when "self.columns" is None.

To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to check if "self.columns" is not None before trying to retrieve its length.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import logging

def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """

    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition "if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0," we ensure that the code will only attempt to get the length of "self.columns" if it is not None. This will prevent the TypeError from occurring.
