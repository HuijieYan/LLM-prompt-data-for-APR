The potential error in the given function is in the else block where the command to check if the partition exists is not being properly executed. 

The bug occurs because the command to check if a specific partition exists is not being constructed properly. The format used in the else block does not match the syntax required for checking partition existence.

To fix the bug, the correct format for checking partition existence needs to be used, and the command needs to be constructed correctly.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, partition))
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
