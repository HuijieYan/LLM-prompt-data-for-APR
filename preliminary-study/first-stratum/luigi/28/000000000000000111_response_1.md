Potential Error Location:
The issue appears to be with the comparison of the table name (case sensitive) with the tables shown in the stdout (case insensitive).

Reasons for the Bug:
The current implementation does a direct comparison of the table name with the tables shown in the stdout, without considering case sensitivity. As a result, the comparison may fail if the case of the table name does not match the case of the table names in stdout.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To make the comparison case-insensitive, the table name and the tables in the stdout should be converted to a consistent case (e.g., lower case) before comparison.

Corrected Code:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected code, the table name is converted to lower case using `table.lower()`, and the tables in the stdout are also converted to lower case using `map(str.lower, stdout.split())`. This way, the comparison is case-insensitive, and the function should work correctly for tables with different cases.
