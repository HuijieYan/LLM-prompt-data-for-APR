The bug is related to the `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class. The issue is that the function does not handle case sensitivity properly, causing failures when checking for table existence in Hive.

The potential error location is within the `table_exists` function, specifically in the comparison of `table` with the output `stdout`.

The reason behind the bug is that the comparison between `table` and `stdout` is case sensitive, leading to false negatives when the table names are in different cases.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to convert both the `table` and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them. This will make the comparison case insensitive and avoid false negatives.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
# corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # returning the result directly
```

In the corrected code, `table.lower()` and `stdout.lower()` are used to perform a case-insensitive comparison, and `bool(stdout)` is used to directly return the result of the comparison. This fix ensures that the `table_exists` function is case insensitive when checking for table existence in Hive.
