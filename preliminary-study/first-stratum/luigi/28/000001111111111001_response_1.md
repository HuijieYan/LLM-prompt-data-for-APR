The error occurs when the test function is calling the `table_exists` method and expecting a certain output. Specifically, it is failing when `returned = self.client.table_exists("MyTable")` is called.

The bug is likely due to a case sensitivity issue when matching the table names. This leads to the method returning the incorrect value, causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the table name comparison is case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output of the `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` method:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the method will now handle case sensitivity correctly, and the test cases should pass without any issues.
