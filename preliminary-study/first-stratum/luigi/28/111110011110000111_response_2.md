The error message in the test function indicates that the test is failing because the table_exists function is case-sensitive. It fails when trying to check if a table exists in a case-insensitive manner.

The potential error location is within the 'table_exists' function, specifically in the section where it checks if the table exists in the stdout.

The reason behind the bug is that the comparison between the table name and the stdout is case-sensitive. This causes the test to fail when it expects the table to exist in a case-insensitive manner.

To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the stdout should be made case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the stdout to lower case before performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the 'table_exists' function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected code, both the table name and the stdout are converted to lower case using the 'lower()' method before comparing them, making the comparison case-insensitive.
