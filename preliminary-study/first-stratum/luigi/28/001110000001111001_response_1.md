The buggy function `table_exists` is designed to check if a given table exists in the specified database. However, there are several issues with the function's implementation that need to be addressed.

1. In the `else` block, the `run_hive_cmd` invocation is missing the `like` keyword in the `show partitions` command. This is causing the function to return the wrong result when a partition is specified.

2. The `run_hive_cmd` output is being used to determine whether the table exists or not, which may lead to incorrect results. Instead, the function should parse the output and check for the existence of the table.

3. Lastly, the `stdout` variable is being used to determine the return value, but the actual text printed to the console is different from the value stored in `stdout`.

To address these issues, the `table_exists` function needs to be modified as follows:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        like_partition = " like " + self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, like_partition))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version of the function, the `show partitions` command within the `else` block includes the `like` keyword for proper syntax. Additionally, the function checks for the existence of the table after running the `run_hive_cmd`, and it returns a boolean value based on the stdout.

With these changes, the `table_exists` function should now work as expected and return the correct results in all test cases.
