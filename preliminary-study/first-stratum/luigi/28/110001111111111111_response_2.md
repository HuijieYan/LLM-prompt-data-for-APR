The test cases `test_table_exists` and `test_apacheclient_table_exists` are failing with an `AssertionError` when checking for case-insensitive table names. 

The potential error is in the `table_exists` function, specifically in the comparison between the table name and the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The comparison is case-sensitive, leading to the test failures when checking for table existence.

The bug occurs because the comparison between the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` is case-sensitive. When the table names are in different cases, the comparisons fail, leading to test failures.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison in the `table_exists` function to be case-insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this modification, the comparison between the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` is now case-insensitive, which should resolve the test failures.
