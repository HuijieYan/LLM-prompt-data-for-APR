The bug is likely occurring in the `table_exists` function. The function does not handle the case sensitivity of table names correctly, which leads to failing test cases.

The bug occurs because the function is directly comparing the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function without considering the case sensitivity of the table names. This results in the function returning incorrect results when the table names are in different cases.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to convert both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before comparing them. This way, case sensitivity is ignored, and the function will return the correct results.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this modification, the function will be case insensitive when checking for the existence of tables, and the test cases are expected to pass. This fix also aligns with the proposed solution in the associated GitHub issue.
