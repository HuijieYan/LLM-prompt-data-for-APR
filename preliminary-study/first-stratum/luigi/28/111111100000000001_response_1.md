The potential error in the function "table_exists" is in the line:
```python
stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
```
This line is trying to use the "partition_spec" method without properly referencing the object instance.

The bug is occurring because the "partition_spec" method is being called using "self.partition_spec(partition)", but "self" is not being passed as an argument to the method. As a result, the method is not being called in the context of the object instance.

To fix this bug, the "partition_spec" method should be called using "self.partition_spec(partition)" so that it is called in the context of the object instance.

Here's the corrected code for the "table_exists" function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_str = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, partition_str))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected code, the "partition_spec" method is called using "self.partition_spec(partition)" to ensure that it is called in the context of the object instance.
