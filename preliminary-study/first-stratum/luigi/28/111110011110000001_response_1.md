The error message indicates that the test failed when it expected the result to be True, but it received False instead. This suggests that the `table_exists` function is not returning the correct result in some cases.

Upon reviewing the code, it appears that the issue may be related to the handling of the `partition` argument in the `table_exists` function. The function is trying to execute a command based on the value of the `partition` argument, but there are inconsistencies in how this is being handled.

The bug occurs because the `self.partition_spec(partition)` call inside the `table_exists` function is not returning the expected partition specification, leading to incorrect commands being executed.

To fix this bug, the `partition_spec` method should be called with the `partition` argument to generate the correct partition specification.

Here is the corrected code with the bug fixed:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition_spec))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
