The error occurs in the `table_exists` method. The method is supposed to check if a given table exists in the specified database. However, the bug is causing the method to return incorrect results when the table name is provided in a different case than the actual table name in the database.

The bug occurs because the method is not handling the case sensitivity of the table names. When the table name provided as input is in a different case than the table name in the database, the method fails to match them correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the input table name and the table names in the stdout to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` method:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
    stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

    if stdout:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

By converting both the input table name and the tables in stdout to lowercase, we can ensure that the comparison is case insensitive, which will fix the bug.

This fix will address the test case insensitivity issue and the method will now correctly identify the existence of a table regardless of the case of the input table name.
