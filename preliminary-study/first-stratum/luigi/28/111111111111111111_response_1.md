The bug in the `table_exists` method is related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence. The method uses `stdout` to check if the table exists, and then compares it with the table name. However, it does not account for case differences between the table name and the output from `stdout`.

In the test cases, the issue arises when checking for table existence using different case versions of the table name. For example, when checking for "MyTable", the function fails to recognize its existence because it expects an exact match with the output.

To fix this bug, the comparison between the table name and the `stdout` output should be made case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the `stdout` output to lower case for comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` method:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the comparison between the table name and `stdout` output is now done in a case-insensitive manner by converting both to lower case before comparing.

This change addresses the issue reported in the test cases and in the GitHub issue, where the table existence check was failing due to case sensitivity.
