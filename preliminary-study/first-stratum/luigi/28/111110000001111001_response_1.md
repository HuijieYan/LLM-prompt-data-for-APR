The buggy function `table_exists` checks if a table exists in a given database. The issue lies in the second part of the function, where it tries to run a command to show partitions. The issue is that the command being constructed is not properly formatted, leading to errors in retrieving the partition information.

The bug occurs because the string formatting and concatenation in the command construction is not done correctly, causing the command to be malformed.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to properly format the command being run based on whether a partition is specified or not. Additionally, the function should properly handle the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function to determine if the table exists.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} ( {2} )".format(database, table, partition_spec))
        return stdout and table in stdout
```

In the corrected code, the command being constructed is properly formatted based on the presence of a partition. Additionally, the output from `run_hive_cmd` is checked to determine if the table exists.
