The bug seems to be in the `table_exists` method of the `HiveCommandClient` class. It fails to handle the case when the table name is not case-sensitive, resulting in the assertion error in the test cases.

The potential error location is the comparison between the table name and its presence in the output of the hive command.

The bug occurred due to the incorrect comparison of the table name in a case-sensitive manner. The current implementation checks for an exact match of the table name in the output, but it should be case-insensitive.

To fix the bug, you can modify the comparison to be case-insensitive using the `lower()` method. This will ensure that the comparison is not affected by the case of the table name.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` method:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This modification ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, addressing the issue raised in the test cases.
