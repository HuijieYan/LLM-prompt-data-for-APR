Potential error location: The potential error is in the second condition within the else block. The use of `self.partition_spec(partition)` is not defined, and it seems to be a method call, but it's not clear from the given code.

Reason behind the bug: The code attempts to determine if a table or partition exists in a database, but there are issues with the syntax and use of the `run_hive_cmd` function. Additionally, the usage of `self.partition_spec(partition)` is not clear and might be causing the bug.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: 
1. Ensure that the `run_hive_cmd` function exists and is correctly implemented.
2. Verify the syntax and usage of the Hive commands 'show tables' and 'show partitions'.
3. Define and implement the `self.partition_spec` method if it is intended to be used.

Corrected code:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition))
        return stdout
```
