The bug occurs in the `table_exists` function, specifically in the conditional statement for checking if the table exists in the specified database. The bug is due to the use of the `partition_spec` method, which is not defined within the `HiveCommandClient` class. Instead, there are multiple `partition_spec` methods defined, leading to potential conflicts and ambiguity.

To fix this bug, the `partition_spec` method should be properly defined within the `HiveCommandClient` class, ensuring that it can be called without any conflicts with other methods of the same name.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        # assuming that `partition_spec` returns the partition specification string
        if isinstance(self, ApacheHiveCommandClient):
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, partition))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected code takes into account the potential differences between the `HiveCommandClient` and `ApacheHiveCommandClient` classes, and appropriately handles the `partition_spec` method based on the class type.
