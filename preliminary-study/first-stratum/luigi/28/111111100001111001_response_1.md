The issue with the `table_exists` method is that the `run_hive_cmd` function is being called without specifying the correct namespace. The run_hive_cmd function is defined outside of the HiveCommandClient class, so it needs to be called as a method of the class. 

Here's the corrected code for the table_exists method:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # this is the corrected method
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = self.run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = self.run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected code, the `run_hive_cmd` function is being called as a method of `self`, which is an instance of the `HiveCommandClient` class. This ensures that the `run_hive_cmd` function is called in the correct context. Additionally, the return statement has been simplified to directly return the result of the `run_hive_cmd` function, converting it to a boolean using `bool()`.
