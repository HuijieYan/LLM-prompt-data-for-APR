The function `table_exists` is returning the wrong values in some scenarios, leading to assertion errors in the test cases.

The issue seems to be related to the handling of the `stdout` variable after the `run_hive_cmd` function is called. The `run_hive_cmd` function returns the output as a string, and the `table_exists` function checks if the table name is in the `stdout` string to determine if the table exists. However, the comparison is not being handled correctly.

To fix this bug, it is recommended to modify the comparison logic for the `stdout` variable in the `table_exists` function. Instead of a simple string match, it would be better to split the returned `stdout` string by newline characters and then check if the table name exists in the list of strings.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the `stdout` string and checking if the table name exists in the list, the comparison becomes more accurate. This change should fix the issue with the `table_exists` function and make the test cases pass without assertion errors.
