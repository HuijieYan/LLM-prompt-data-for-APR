The bug is in the `table_exists` method of the `HiveCommandClient` class. The method is not handling the case where the table name is case-sensitive. In the test function, the assertion is failing when it tries to check if the table exists in a case-insensitive manner.

The reason behind the bug is that the method only checks for the presence of the table without considering the case of the table name.

To fix the bug, the method needs to handle the case sensitivity of the table name. We can use the `lower()` method to convert the table name to lowercase before checking for its existence. This way, we can ensure that the table name is treated in a case-insensitive manner.

Here's the corrected `table_exists` method:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This correction ensures that the table existence is checked in a case-insensitive manner, which should resolve the assertions in the test functions.
