The issue in the provided function `table_exists` is that it uses the `run_hive_cmd` function without specifying the module from which it should be imported. This can cause the function to not recognize `run_hive_cmd` and result in a NameError. Additionally, the string interpolation in the else statement is incorrect.

To fix the bug, the import statement for `run_hive_cmd` needs to be added at the beginning of the file, and the else statement's interpolation should be modified to use the correct method.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Users/jerry/Documents/GitHub/LPPR/local_envs/repos/luigi_28/luigi/contrib/hive.py

# Add an import statement at the beginning of the file
from luigi.contrib.hive import run_hive_cmd

# class declaration containing the function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            # Modify the interpolation to use the correct method
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {}; show partitions {} partition ({})'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```
