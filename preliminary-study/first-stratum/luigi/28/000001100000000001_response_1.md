Potential Error Location: 

The error could be in the way the `run_hive_cmd` function is being called and also in the way the `partition_spec` function is being used.

Reason behind the Bug: 

The `run_hive_cmd` function is being called without the correct namespace or importation. Additionally, the `partition_spec` function is being called with `self` as a parameter, indicating that it should be an instance method, but it is defined as a standalone function. 

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: 

1. Import the `run_hive_cmd` function from the appropriate module.
2. Ensure that the `partition_spec` function is defined as an instance method if it needs to be called with `self` as a parameter, or change the way it is called.

Corrected Code:

```python
# import the run_hive_cmd function from the appropriate module
from luigi.contrib.hive import run_hive_cmd

class YourClassName:
    # other methods...

    # fix the partition_spec method if it needs to be an instance method
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # fix the table_exists method
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            # use the correct namespace for the partition_spec method
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```
