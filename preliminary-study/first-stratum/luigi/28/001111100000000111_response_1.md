The bug in the provided function `table_exists` is that it does not account for case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. 

This bug occurs because when checking for the existence of a table in Hive, the function compares the table name without considering the case of the characters. Hive is case insensitive and will return table names in lowercase, so the comparison should take this into account.

To fix this bug, the comparison between the table name and the output should be made case insensitive. This can be done by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected code, both the table name and the output from Hive are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` function before comparing them. This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive and fixes the bug.
