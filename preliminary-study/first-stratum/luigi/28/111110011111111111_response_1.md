Based on the provided information, the bug is occurring due to case sensitivity in the `table_exists` function. The function compares the table name with the stdout without considering case sensitivity. This causes the function to fail in case the table name is in a different case than the one returned by the `stdout`.

To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the stdout should be made case insensitive.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        partitions = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partitions))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By making the comparison case insensitive using `lower()` on both the table name and the `stdout`, the function will return the correct result regardless of the case of the table name.

Additionally, the test functions should be updated with the corrected function name, and their input parameters should be defined as per the expected values.

The GitHub issue titles and descriptions are valid for suggesting the need for the fix and providing a potential solution. The correction of the function and test function will address the reported bug.
