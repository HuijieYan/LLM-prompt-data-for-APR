The bug occurs because the `table_exists` function checks for the exact case of the table name in the `stdout` returned from the `hive` command. However, Hive is case insensitive, so the table name in the `stdout` may be in a different case than the one specified in the function input.

To fix this issue, the `table_exists` function should convert both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase for comparison. This will make the comparison case insensitive and prevent the bug from occurring.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                           (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

The changes made include converting both the input table name and the `stdout` to lowercase using the `lower()` method before performing the comparison. This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive and fixes the bug.
