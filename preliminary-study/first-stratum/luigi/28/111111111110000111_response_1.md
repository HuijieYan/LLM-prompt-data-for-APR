The error in the `table_exists` function occurs because the comparison between the table name and the tables in the database is case-sensitive. This causes the function to return incorrect results when checking for table existence by failing to account for case differences.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison to be case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the tables in the database to lowercase before performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected function, both the `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before performing the comparison.

This modification will make the `table_exists` function case-insensitive when checking for table existence, as requested in the GitHub issue #896.
