The test cases are checking the behavior of the `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` and `ApacheHiveCommandClient` classes. The error message indicates that the test case is failing when checking for case insensitivity in table names.

The potential error location is identified within the `table_exists` function, where the comparison between the table name and the returned value from `run_hive_cmd` is being performed.

The bug is occurring because the comparison of table names is case-sensitive, but the expected behavior is to be case-insensitive. This is causing the test cases to fail when checking for tables with different casing.

To fix the bug, the comparison should be made case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the returned value from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this change, the comparison between the table name and the returned value from `run_hive_cmd` will be case-insensitive, addressing the issue reported in the test cases and GitHub issue.

This fix is aligned with the proposed fix in GitHub issue #896, which suggests making the `table_exists` function case insensitive by checking `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.
