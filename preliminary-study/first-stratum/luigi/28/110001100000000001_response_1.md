The potential error in the `table_exists` function is that the `run_hive_cmd` function is not being called properly. Additionally, the string formatting in the `stdout` assignment inside the `else` block is incorrect.

The bug occurs because the `run_hive_cmd` function is being used as if it were a standalone function, rather than being called as a method of the `hive` class. Additionally, the string formatting in the `else` block is not using the correct syntax.

To fix the bug, the `run_hive_cmd` function should be called using the correct syntax and the string formatting in the `else` block should be corrected.

```python
# relative function's signature in this file
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def partition_spec(self, partition):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def partition_spec(self, partition):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def partition_spec(self, partition):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass


# this is the corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = self.run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = self.run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```
