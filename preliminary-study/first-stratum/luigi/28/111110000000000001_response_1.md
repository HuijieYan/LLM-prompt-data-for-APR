The potential error in the function `table_exists` is in the `else` block where the `stdout` variable is assigned a value based on the result of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The issue seems to be with the formatting of the command string being passed to `run_hive_cmd`.

The bug occurs because the `run_hive_cmd` function is not being called properly within the `else` block, leading to incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly format the command string being passed to `run_hive_cmd` and call the `run_hive_cmd` function with the correct parameters.

Here is the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_str = 'partition' + str(partition) if isinstance(partition, int) else partition
        cmd = 'use {0}; show partitions {1} {2} ({3})'.format(database, table, partition_str, self.partition_spec(partition))
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(cmd)

        return bool(stdout)
```
