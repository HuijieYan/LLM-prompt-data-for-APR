The issue in the `table_exists` function is that when the `partition` parameter is passed, the `run_hive_cmd` function is called with a faulty query string.

The bug occurs because in the `else` block of the `table_exists` function, the method `self.partition_spec(partition)` is called. However, it seems that `partition_spec` is a separate function and should not be called on `self`. This is likely a typo, and the intended behavior is to call the `partition_spec` function directly, rather than through `self`.

To fix the bug, the `partition_spec` function should be called directly. Additionally, the parameter `partition` should be converted to a string before used in constructing the query string. This can be achieved using the `str(partition)` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_str = str(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, partition_str))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version, the `partition_spec` method is removed, and the `str(partition)` method is used to create a string representation of the `partition` parameter for constructing the query string.
