The error message indicates that the `table_exists` function is not working as expected. It is failing for the test case where the table name has different cases ("MyTable" instead of "mytable").

The potential error is likely within the `table_exists` function, specifically in the comparison of the table name when checking if the table exists.

The bug seems to be related to case sensitivity when checking the presence of a table in the database. The function is not converting both table names to the same case before comparison, leading to the assertion error in the test case.

To fix the bug, the comparison should be case-insensitive. Additionally, it might be a good practice to normalize the case of the table names before comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected code, the table names are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison. This ensures case-insensitive comparison when checking for table existence.
