The error message indicates an assertion failure in the test function `test_table_exists`. The error occurred when trying to assert `self.assertTrue(returned)`, and it failed because `returned` was False when it was expected to be True.

The potential error in the problematic function is in the `table_exists` method. The issue seems to be with the conditional statement and the way the output of `run_hive_cmd` is being handled.

The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of the stdout output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The `table_exists` method does not handle the case where `run_hive_cmd` returns an empty string properly, and it also does not account for case sensitivity when checking for the table existence.

To fix the bug, we should update the `table_exists` method to properly handle the case where `run_hive_cmd` returns an empty string. Additionally, we should make the table name comparison case-insensitive.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` method:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))

        return stdout.lower().strip() == table.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected code:
1. We are using `show tables in {database};` instead of `show tables like "{table}";` to ensure we get the exact table name.
2. We are using `stdout.lower()` and `table.lower()` to compare the table names case-insensitively.
3. We are using `bool(stdout)` directly to check if `run_hive_cmd` returned any output for the partition existence.
