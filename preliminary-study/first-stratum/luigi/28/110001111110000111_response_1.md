The error message indicates that the `test_table_exists` and `test_apacheclient_table_exists` test cases are failing due to the `self.assertTrue(returned)` assertion. This suggests that the `table_exists` function is not returning the expected results.

The potential error location within the `table_exists` function is the comparison between the table name and the values in the `stdout` variable.

The bug is occurring because the comparison between the table name and the values in the `stdout` variable is case sensitive. Hive is case insensitive, so the comparison needs to be case insensitive as well.

To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the values in the `stdout` variable should be made case insensitive. This can be done by converting both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

    return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

    if stdout:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

This code ensures that the comparison between the table name and the values in the `stdout` variable is done in a case insensitive manner, addressing the issue raised in the bug report.
