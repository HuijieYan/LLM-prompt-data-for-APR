Potential error location: The issue lies in the comparison of the table name with the output from the Hive command. The bug is causing the comparison to be case-sensitive, which results in the failure to find a match when the table name is in a different case.

Reason for the bug: The table name and the output from the Hive command are not being compared in a case-insensitive manner, leading to false negatives when checking for the existence of a table.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Convert both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase before comparison.
2. Use a case-insensitive comparison function to compare the table name with the output from the Hive command.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
