The error occurs in the `test_table_exists` function. The error message indicates that the assertion `self.assertTrue(returned)` fails, meaning that the function is not returning the expected value.

The issue lies in the `table_exists` function itself. The bug is caused by the case sensitivity of the table name comparison. The function only checks if the exact table name is found in the database, without considering the case of the table name.

To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output from the database to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition).lower()))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the table name comparison will be case insensitive, and the test cases should pass without issues.
