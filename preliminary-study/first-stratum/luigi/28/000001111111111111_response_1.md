The error occurs in the `table_exists` function, specifically in the conditional statement that checks if the table exists.

The bug originates from the fact that the table name is not being converted to lowercase before comparing it with the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. Since Hive is case-insensitive, the comparison fails when the table name has a different case than the one returned by Hive.

To fix this bug, the table name should be converted to lowercase before comparing it with the output of `run_hive_cmd`. This will make the comparison case-insensitive and resolve the issue.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function will perform a case-insensitive comparison, allowing the tests to pass successfully.
