The bug in the `table_exists` method is due to a case-sensitive comparison between the table name and the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. Hive is case insensitive, so the table name should be converted to lowercase before comparing it with the output.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `table_exists` method to convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the output. This will ensure that the comparison is case insensitive and will work correctly for tables with different case conventions.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` method:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this change, the `table_exists` method will now perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function, which will prevent issues with case sensitivity.
