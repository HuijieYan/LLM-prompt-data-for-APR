The bug is present in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class. The bug is identified in the if-else section where it checks for the existence of the table and the partition.

The bug occurs because the function does not account for the case sensitivity of the table name. In the test cases, the table names are provided as "mytable" and "MyTable", and the function does not handle the case sensitivity which leads to a false assertion in the test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case sensitivity of the table names. We can convert the table names to lowercase before comparing in the function.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected code, the table names in both `stdout` and `table` are converted to lowercase before comparison, ensuring that the comparison is not case-sensitive.

This change will fix the bug and make the function behavior consistent with the test expectations.
