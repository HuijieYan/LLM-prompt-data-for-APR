Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the comparison of the table name with the stdout, which is case sensitive.

Reasons behind the bug: The `table_exists` function compares the table name with the `stdout` from the hive command without considering case sensitivity. This causes the comparison to fail when the table name is capitalized.

Approaches for fixing the bug: Compare the table name with the `stdout` after converting both to lowercase to avoid case sensitivity issues.

Corrected code:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
