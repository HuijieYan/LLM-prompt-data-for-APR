The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in the database. This causes issues when the table name is in a different case from what is returned by the Hive command.

To fix this bug, the function should convert both the table name and the output from the Hive command to the same case (e.g., lower case) before comparing them.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This fixes the bug by converting both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lower case before comparing them, ensuring that the comparison is case-insensitive.
