The error seems to be occurring when the `table_exists` function is being called with a table name that has a different case than what is returned in the `stdout` from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

The bug is that the function is case sensitive when checking if the table exists in the Hive database. The function currently compares the input table name directly with the output from the Hive command, which may not match due to case sensitivity.

To fix this bug, we can convert both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase (or uppercase) before comparing them. This will make the comparison case-insensitive and the function will return the correct result.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this modification, the `table_exists` function will now perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the `stdout`, allowing it to correctly determine whether the table exists in the Hive database regardless of the case.
