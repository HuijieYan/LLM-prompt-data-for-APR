The test case 'test_table_exists' in the `contrib.hive_test` module is designed to test the `table_exists` method of the `HiveCommandClient` class. The method `table_exists` is expected to return True if a table exists and False if it does not.

The error message indicates that the assertion `self.assertTrue(returned)` within the test case fails, as it expected 'True' but received 'False'. This suggests that the `table_exists` method is not functioning as expected.

The potential error in the `table_exists` method is the logic for checking if the table exists when a partition is not specified. The logic uses the result of the `run_hive_cmd` function to determine if the table exists. It checks if the table name is in the result. However, the logic does not consider the case when the table does not exist, which could result in an incorrect evaluation.

To fix this, we can modify the logic to explicitly check for the presence or absence of the table in the result of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

Here is the corrected code for the `table_exists` method:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.splitlines()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```
In this corrected code, the return value for the case when a partition is not specified is modified to check if the table name is present in the lines of the stdout. Additionally, the logic for checking the presence of the stdout when a partition is specified is simplified to return True if the stdout is not empty.
