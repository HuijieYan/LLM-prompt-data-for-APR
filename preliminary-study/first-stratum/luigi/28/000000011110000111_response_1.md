The error seems to occur when the test case is checking for the existence of a table in a case-insensitive manner. The current implementation of the `table_exists` function does not handle case insensitivity.

The potential error location within the `table_exists` function is in the comparison of the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The comparison is case-sensitive, leading to the test failures.

The bug occurs because the function does not account for case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The function directly compares the table name with the output from Hive, leading to failures when the case of the table name does not match the case of the table in the database.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparing them. This will make the comparison case-insensitive and ensure that the function works correctly for tables with different casing.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function will perform a case-insensitive comparison of the table name and the output from Hive, ensuring that the test cases pass and the function works as expected.
