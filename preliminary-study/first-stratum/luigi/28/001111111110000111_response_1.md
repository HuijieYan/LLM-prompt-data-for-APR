The error message indicates that the `table_exists` function is not returning the expected results when testing for case insensitivity. This is evident from the assertion error `AssertionError: False is not true` in the test function.

The potential error location within the `table_exists` function is in the comparison between the `table` and the `stdout`. This comparison is not case insensitive, leading to the test failures when the table name is provided in different cases.

The bug occurs because the `table_exists` function performs a direct string comparison between the input table name and the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function, without considering case sensitivity.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lower case (or upper case) before comparison. This will make the comparison case insensitive.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})")

        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected code, both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` are converted to lower case before comparison using the `lower()` method. This ensures a case insensitive comparison, addressing the issue identified in the test cases.
