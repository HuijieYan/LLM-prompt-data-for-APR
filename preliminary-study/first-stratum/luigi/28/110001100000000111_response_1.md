1. The issue seems to be related to case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive.

2. The potential error location is in the "table_exists" function where the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive is being performed.

3. The bug occurs because the comparison is case-sensitive, causing the test to fail when the table names are not in the expected case.

4. One possible approach for fixing the bug is to convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before performing the comparison. This would make the comparison case-insensitive and prevent the test from failing due to case differences.

5. Here is the corrected code for the "table_exists" function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```
