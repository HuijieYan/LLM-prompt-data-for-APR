The issue seems to be in the `table_exists` function. The function is not handling the case-insensitivity of table names properly, and it is not including the partition check in the `else` clause. 

The reason for the bug is that the function is not comparing the table names in a case-insensitive manner, and it's not including the partition check in the `else` clause.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle case-insensitivity and include the partition check in the `else` clause.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    table = table.lower()  # Convert table name to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table in stdout.lower()  # Also convert stdout to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison
    else:
        partition_str = ', '.join(['{}="{}"'.format(key, value) for key, value in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, partition_str))
        
        return bool(stdout)  # If stdout is not empty, return True, otherwise, return False
```

With these changes, the function should now handle case-insensitivity and include the partition check in the `else` clause, fixing the bug.
