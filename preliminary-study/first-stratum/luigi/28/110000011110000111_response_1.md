The test case is for the function `table_exists` in the `contrib.hive` module. The error message indicates that the test case is failing at the assertion `self.assertTrue(returned)`.

The potential error location within the function is in the conditional check when comparing the table name with the tables listed in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. 

The bug occurs because the comparison is case-sensitive, and it causes the test to fail when checking for tables with different cases.

To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the tables listed in the output of `run_hive_cmd` should be made case-insensitive.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.splitlines())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected code:
- In the conditional check for table existence, `table.lower()` is compared with each table name in the `stdout` list converted to lowercase using `map(str.lower, stdout.splitlines())`.
- The conditional check for `partition` is simplified, and the `stdout` value is directly returned as a boolean.

By making the comparisons case-insensitive, the bug is fixed, and the function should work correctly, addressing the test failures reported.
