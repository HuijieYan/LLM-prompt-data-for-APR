The error occurs in the `test_apacheclient_table_exists` test function. The test is expecting `self.assertTrue(returned)` to be True, but it is False based on the `run_command` return value.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `table_exists` method.

The bug occurs because the `table_exists` method does not handle the case where the partition is None correctly. It fails to parse the stdout properly for the case where partition is None, leading to the incorrect return value.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `table_exists` method to handle the case where the partition is None properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` method:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        if isinstance(partition, dict):
            partition_str = ', '.join([f"{k}='{v}'" for k, v in partition.items()])
        else:
            partition_str = partition

        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, partition_str))

        return bool(stdout)
```
In the corrected code, we handle the case where `partition` is a dictionary by creating a comma-separated string of key-value pairs, and then using it in the `run_hive_cmd` call. This will ensure that the correct partition specification is used in the hive command, and the correct stdout is returned.
