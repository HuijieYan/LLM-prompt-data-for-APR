Analysis:
The error message indicates that the test 'test_table_exists' is failing because the assertion for 'self.assertTrue(returned)' is not passing. This suggests that the table_exists function is not handling case sensitivity correctly, which is consistent with the GitHub issue title and description provided.

Error location:
The issue likely stems from the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command, where the case sensitivity is not being handled properly.

Reasons behind the bug:
The table_exists function is not taking into account the case sensitivity of table names in the Hive command output. This results in incorrect comparisons and test failures when the case of the table name does not match the case of the output.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
To fix this bug, the table name should be converted to lowercase before comparison with the Hive command output, making the comparison case-insensitive. This will ensure that the function behaves consistently and passes the test cases.

Corrected code:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

The corrected code converts both the table name and the Hive command output to lowercase before comparison, ensuring a case-insensitive match. This should resolve the issue and make the table_exists function behave as expected.
