The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it doesn't account for case insensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd`. This causes the test cases to fail when the table name is in a different case than expected.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lower case before comparison.

Here's the corrected `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this modification, the function now performs a case insensitive comparison between the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd`, which should resolve the test failures and address the issue related to case sensitivity.
