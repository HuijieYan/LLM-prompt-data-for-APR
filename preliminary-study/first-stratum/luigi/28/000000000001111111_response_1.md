The issue with the provided function `table_exists` is that it does not handle the case sensitivity of table names in Hive. 

In the given buggy function, when the table name is passed as an input parameter, it is not converted to lowercase for comparison with the output received from the Hive command. This can cause issues when the table names are case sensitive.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to convert the input table name to lowercase before comparing it with the output from the Hive command.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table.lower()))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table.lower(), self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected function converts the input table name to lowercase using the `lower()` function before comparing it with the output from the Hive command. This makes the comparison case insensitive, addressing the issue described in the GitHub issue.
