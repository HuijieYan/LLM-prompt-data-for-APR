The error message in the test function indicates that the assertion `self.assertTrue(returned)` is failing, which means the expected value is not being returned by the function `table_exists`.

Upon reviewing the function `table_exists`, the potential error lies in the else block where the `stdout` is being returned as a boolean value.

The reason for the bug is that the `stdout` variable inside the else block is not being evaluated properly to determine if the table exists with the specified partition.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic within the else block to properly evaluate the `stdout` variable and return the correct boolean value.

Here is the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_cmd = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_cmd))
        return bool(stdout)
```

With this corrected code, the function will properly check if the specified table exists with the given partition and return the correct boolean value.
