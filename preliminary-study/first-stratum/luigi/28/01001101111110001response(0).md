The error seems to be related to the `table_exists` method not returning the expected result in the test case. The test case expects the method to return `True` for the table name "mytable" and `False` for an empty string, but it's returning the opposite.

The potential error location is within the conditional statements in the `table_exists` method, where the check for the existence of the table or partition is being performed.

The bug is likely occurring due to the logic in the conditional statements. In the first conditional block, the method checks if the `stdout` contains the table name, and if it does, it returns `True`. However, the test case expects `True` for a non-empty `stdout`, whereas the method is returning `True` when the table is not in the `stdout`.

Similarly, in the second conditional block where it's checking for the existence of the partition, the logic is probably flawed.

To fix the bug, the conditional statements inside the `table_exists` method need to be adjusted to return the correct value based on the presence of the table or partition in the `stdout`.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` method:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout.strip() == table
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        return bool(stdout.strip())  # Check if the stdout is non-empty and return True if so
```

In the corrected code, for the first conditional block, we are checking if the trimmed `stdout` is equal to the table name, and for the second conditional block, we are returning `True` if the trimmed `stdout` is non-empty, indicating the existence of the partition. This should fix the bug and align the method's behavior with the test case expectations.
