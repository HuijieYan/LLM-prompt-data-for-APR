The bug in the `table_exists` method is due to the case sensitivity of the comparison between the table name and the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The bug causes the test cases `test_table_exists` and `test_apacheclient_table_exists` to fail due to their expectation of a case-insensitive comparison.

To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the `run_hive_cmd` output should be made case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

Additionally, the function signature should be modified to include the `table` parameter as a required input, as it is used in the function body without a default value.

Here's the corrected `table_exists` method:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By using the lowercase versions of the table name and the stdout for comparison, the function will now be case-insensitive, addressing the issues with the failing test cases.
