1. The issue is that the `table_exists` function in the provided code does not handle case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. It only checks for an exact match between the table name and the output from the Hive command, which can lead to failures when the case of the table name doesn't match the case of the output from Hive.

2. The potential error in the function is in the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive. The function should account for case insensitivity when checking for the existence of the table.

3. The bug occurs because the function does not account for the case insensitivity of Hive when checking for table existence. It assumes an exact match between the input table name and the output from Hive, which can lead to false negatives when the case of the table name does not match the case of the output.

4. To fix the bug, the function should convert both the input table name and the output from Hive to lowercase (or uppercase) before comparing them.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # No need for if/else, just return the boolean value directly
```

In the corrected code, both the input table name and the output from Hive are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison, making the check case insensitive. Additionally, the last part of the code is simplified by directly returning the boolean value of `stdout` without using an `if/else` statement.
