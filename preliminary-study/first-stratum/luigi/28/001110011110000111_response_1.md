1. From the error message, it is evident that the test is failing when checking for the existence of a table in a case-sensitive manner. The issue seems to stem from the function `table_exists` being case-sensitive.

2. The potential error location within the `table_exists` function is the comparison of the table name `table` with the output `stdout`.

3. The bug is occurring because the comparison between the table name and the output is case-sensitive. This causes the test to fail if the table name provided does not exactly match the case of the table name in the output.

4. To fix the bug, we can convert both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing them. This will make the comparison case-insensitive and ensure that the test cases pass irrespective of the case of the table name.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        partition_output = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2});""".format(database, table, partition_output))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected code, both the `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` function before comparison. This will ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive and will fix the bug.
