The bug is occurring in the `table_exists` method of the HiveCommandClient class. The method is failing the test case `test_table_exists` and `test_apacheclient_table_exists` for the different cases.

The issue seems to be with the conditional checks inside the `table_exists` method. The code is not handling the cases correctly, leading to AssertionErrors in the test cases.

As for the bug, the root cause is the incorrect conditional checks within the `table_exists` method. The method is not correctly handling the presence of a partition, and the conditionals are not working as expected.

To fix the bug, the method should be updated to properly handle the partition and perform the checks accordingly. Below is the corrected implementation of the `table_exists` method:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {};" |
                            "show partitions {} partition ({})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout.strip())
```

With this corrected method, the conditional checks are properly handled, and the method will return the expected boolean value based on the presence of the table or partition. This should resolve the issues in the test cases.
