The error message shows that the test is failing when it expects `True` but gets `False` instead.

Upon analyzing the provided code, the buggy function is `table_exists`. The issue might be in the condition to return `True` or `False` based on the result from the `run_hive_cmd` function. 

The reason for the bug could be in the conditional statements. In the 'if' statement, the function checks for the table's presence in the stdout output and returns the result. However, the condition might not be evaluating properly or the returned value might not be as expected.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to correctly evaluate the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and determine whether the table exists or not. Additionally, it's important to check both the provided table name and its lowercase version to cover the case insensitivity requirement.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
        return any(table.lower() == t.lower() for t in stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```
