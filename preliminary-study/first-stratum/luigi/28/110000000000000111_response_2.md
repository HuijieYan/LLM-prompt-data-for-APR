The issue with the provided function is that it does not handle case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive.

The reason for the bug is that the function does not account for the fact that Hive is case insensitive when it comes to table names. This means that if the table name is 'FooBar', Hive will return it as 'foobar', causing the function to incorrectly believe that the table does not exist.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to be case insensitive when checking for the existence of the table. This can be done by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function now properly handles case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive.
