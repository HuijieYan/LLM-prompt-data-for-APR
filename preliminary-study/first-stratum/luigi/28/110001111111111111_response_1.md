The bug in the `table_exists` method is likely caused by the case sensitivity of the table name comparison in the `stdout`. The bug causes the test cases to fail because the returned value from the `run_hive_cmd` is not being properly compared against the input table name, which may be in a different case. This issue is also mentioned in the GitHub issue titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?"

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison of the table name in the `stdout` to be case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before performing the comparison.

The corrected code for the `table_exists` method is as follows:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
``` 

With this modification, the comparison between the table name and the `stdout` will be case insensitive, and the test cases should pass as expected.
