The buggy function `table_exists` is supposed to check if a table exists in a database. However, the function has a bug that causes it to fail in some test cases. The error message from the test function indicates that the function is not returning the expected values, leading to assertions failing.

The potential error in the function is in the way it compares the table name with the results from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The bug occurs because the comparison is case sensitive, but Hive tables are case insensitive.

To fix the bug and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive, the comparison should be done after converting both the table name and the result from `run_hive_cmd` to lower case.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function will convert both the table name and the result from `run_hive_cmd` to lower case before performing the comparison, making it case insensitive.

Additionally, the test function can also be updated to reflect the changes in the `table_exists` function. The test cases should be updated to account for the case insensitivity when checking for the existence of tables.

Finally, the issue on GitHub (Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive) suggests making the `table_exists` function case insensitive, and it aligns with the approach we took to fix the bug. This fix should address the issues reported in the test function.

By implementing these changes, the bug should be fixed, and the `table_exists` function should work as expected, passing all test cases.
