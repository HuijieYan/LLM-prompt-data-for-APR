The issue in the `table_exists` function seems to be with the `run_hive_cmd` function. It is likely that the function is not properly importing the `run_hive_cmd` function from another module, which is causing the NameError when the function is called.

To fix this issue, the `run_hive_cmd` function should be properly imported at the beginning of the file or within the same module.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
# Import the run_hive_cmd function
from luigi.contrib.hive import run_hive_cmd

# Corrected table_exists function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By properly importing the `run_hive_cmd` function, the function is now capable of running the Hive commands and checking for the existence of the specified table within the given database.
