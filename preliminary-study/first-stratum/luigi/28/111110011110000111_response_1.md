The error message indicates that the `table_exists` function is not returning the expected results, specifically in the case where the table name is in a different case. This suggests that the function might not be handling case sensitivity correctly.

Upon analyzing the code, it appears that the issue is in the comparison of the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. It seems that the function is not considering the case of the table names, leading to the test failures.

The reason behind this bug is that the function is comparing the table name directly with the output from `run_hive_cmd`, which might have a different case for the table name due to the case insensitivity of Hive.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to ensure that the comparison takes into account the case insensitivity of Hive. This can be done by converting both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lower case before performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        partition_output = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, partition_output))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected code:
- Both the `table` and `stdout` are converted to lower case using the `lower()` method before comparison. This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive.
- The `partition_output` is retrieved separately before running `run_hive_cmd` for better readability and easier debugging.

This corrected function should address the case sensitivity issue and pass the provided test cases.
