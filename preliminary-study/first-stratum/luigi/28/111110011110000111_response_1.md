The error message from the test function indicates that the `table_exists` function is failing the test case for case insensitivity.

The potential error location is within the conditional check for table existence, specifically where the `table` is being checked against the `stdout` without converting both to lowercase for case insensitivity.

The bug occurs because the function is not performing a case-insensitive comparison between the provided table name and the output from the hive command. Therefore, when the actual output from the hive command is in a different case than the provided table name, the comparison fails.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to convert both the provided table name and the output from the hive command to lowercase or uppercase before comparing them. This will ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected code, both the provided table name and the output from the hive command are converted to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison using the `lower()` method.

This fix addresses the bug by making the `table_exists` function case insensitive and should resolve the issues identified in the test cases.
