Potential error location: The bug seems to be caused by the case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the database.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The function currently checks for an exact match of the table name in the stdout, which causes issues when the table name is in a different case than expected.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Normalize the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing.
2. Use a case-insensitive comparison method to compare the table name with the stdout.

Corrected code:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())  # Case insensitive comparison
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
