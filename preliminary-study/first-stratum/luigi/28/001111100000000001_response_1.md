The potential error in the `table_exists` function is the incorrect usage of the `partition_spec` method. The `self.partition_spec(partition)` is being called without initializing the `HiveCommandClient` class with the `partition_spec` method.

The bug occurred because the `partition_spec` method is not correctly called or implemented within the `table_exists` function. It seems like the intention is to call the `partition_spec` method from the `HiveCommandClient` class, but it's not done correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to properly call the `partition_spec` method from the `HiveCommandClient` class.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... other methods ...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, partition_str))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```
