The test case `test_table_exists` is trying to test the `table_exists` method of a `HiveCommandClient` object. However, the method that the test is trying to call seems to be named `table_exists` as a method of an object called `apacheclient`, which seems to be a different object.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the incorrect reference to `self` in the calls to `self.partition_spec(partition)` and `self.apacheclient`. This reference is probably meant to refer to an instance of a class that has a `partition_spec` method and an `apacheclient` attribute.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `self` reference is used incorrectly and does not point to the expected object, causing the method calls to fail and leading to the assertion errors in the test.

To fix the bug, the correct instance or object needs to be referenced in the `table_exists` method, and the method should be updated accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` method:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

And the corrected test function:

```python
# file name: /Users/jerry/Documents/GitHub/LPPR/local_envs/repos/luigi_28/test/contrib/hive_test.py

@mock.patch("luigi.contrib.hive.run_hive_cmd")
def test_table_exists(self, run_command):
    run_command.return_value = "OK"
    returned = self.client.table_exists("mytable")
    self.assertFalse(returned)

    run_command.return_value = "OK\n" \
                               "mytable"
    returned = self.client.table_exists("mytable")
    self.assertTrue(returned)

    # Issue #896 test case insensitivity
    returned = self.client.table_exists("MyTable")
    self.assertTrue(returned)

    run_command.return_value = "day=2013-06-28/hour=3\n" \
                               "day=2013-06-28/hour=4\n" \
                               "day=2013-07-07/hour=2\n"
    self.client.partition_spec = mock.Mock(name="partition_spec")
    self.client.partition_spec.return_value = "somepart"
    returned = self.client.table_exists("mytable", partition={'a': 'b'})
    self.assertTrue(returned)

    run_command.return_value = ""
    returned = self.client.table_exists("mytable", partition={'a': 'b'})
    self.assertFalse(returned)
```
