Potential Error Location:
The bug is likely within the comparison of the table name with the lowercase output of the Hive command. This is likely causing the function to incorrectly determine whether the table exists.

Reasons behind Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not handle case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output of the Hive command. Since Hive is case insensitive, the comparison should also be case insensitive to accurately determine if the table exists.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the output of the Hive command should be made case insensitive. This can be done by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing.

Corrected Code:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass


    # Corrected table_exists function with case insensitivity
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
