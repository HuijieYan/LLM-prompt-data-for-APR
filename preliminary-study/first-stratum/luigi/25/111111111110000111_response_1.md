The error occurs at line 166 in the `run` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi.contrib.redshift` module. The error is a `TypeError: 'str' object is not callable`, which indicates that a string object is being called as a function.

The function `s3_load_path` is called as a method in the `run` method, which is causing the error. The reason behind this is that the `s3_load_path` attribute is assigned a string value instead of a method/function.

To fix this bug, the `s3_load_path` attribute should be assigned a method/function instead of a string.

Here is the corrected code for the `S3CopyToTable` class with the bug fixed:

```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable):
    """
    Template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from s3.

    Usage:

    * Subclass and override the required attributes:
      * `host`,
      * `database`,
      * `user`,
      * `password`,
      * `table`,
      * `columns`,
      * `aws_access_key_id`,
      * `aws_secret_access_key`,
      * `s3_load_path`.
