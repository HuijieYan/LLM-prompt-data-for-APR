The error occurs because the variable `self.s3_load_path` is being considered as a method and called with `()` syntax when it is actually a string. This causes the TypeError because a string is not callable.

To fix this bug, the `self.s3_load_path` should be treated as a string and not called as a method. The corrected code for the function `run` is as follows:

```python
def run(self):
    
    if not (self.table):
        raise Exception("table needs to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path  # Corrected
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```

By modifying `path = self.s3_load_path()` to `path = self.s3_load_path`, we ensure that `self.s3_load_path` is treated as a string variable, resolving the TypeError issue caused by trying to call a string as a method.
