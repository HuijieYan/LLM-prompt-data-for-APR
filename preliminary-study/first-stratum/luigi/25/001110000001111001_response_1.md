The potential error location within the `run` function is where it checks if `self.table` has a value and raises an exception if it doesn't. This could be causing the function to raise an exception and not execute the rest of the code.

The bug occurs because the `run` function raises an exception if `self.table` is not specified, but it doesn't handle the case where the table exists and `do_truncate_table` is false. This can lead to the function not executing properly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `run` function to handle the case where the table already exists and `do_truncate_table` is false. We also need to ensure that the function executes the rest of the code after checking if `self.table` has a value.

Here's the corrected code for the `run` function:

```python
def run(self):
    if not (self.table):
        raise Exception("table needs to be specified")
    
    path = self.s3_load_path()
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    else:
        if self.do_truncate_table():
            logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
            self.truncate_table(connection)
    
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()
    
    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```

In the corrected code, we added an else statement to check if the table exists and `do_truncate_table` is false. This ensures that the function continues to execute the remaining code in that case. The rest of the code remains the same.
