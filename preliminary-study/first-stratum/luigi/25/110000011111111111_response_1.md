The error occurs when the `s3_load_path` attribute is called as a method within the `run` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class.

The reason for this error is that `s3_load_path` is being called as a method, but it is actually defined as a string parameter in the `MyRedshiftTask` class and inherited by the `S3CopyToTable` class. Therefore, calling it as a method results in a `TypeError`.

To fix this issue, the `s3_load_path` attribute should be accessed as a string parameter only, without the parentheses, like `self.s3_load_path`.

Here's the corrected code for the `run` method:

```python
def run(self):
    """
    If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
    will be called to attempt to create the table.
    """

    if not (self.table):
        raise Exception("table need to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path  # fix: accessing s3_load_path attribute as a string
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```

By making this change, the TypeError that occurred when calling `self.s3_load_path()` as a method should be resolved.
