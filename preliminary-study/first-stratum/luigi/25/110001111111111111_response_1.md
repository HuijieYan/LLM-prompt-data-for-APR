The issue is occurring at the line `path = self.s3_load_path()` in the `run` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class. The error message indicates that a `TypeError` is being raised because a string object is being called as a function.

The reason for this bug is that `self.s3_load_path` is defined as a string parameter in the `S3CopyToTable` class, but it is being called as a function in the `run` method.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the parentheses when referencing `self.s3_load_path` to indicate that it's a parameter, not a function call.

Here is the corrected code for the `run` method:

```python
def run(self):
    """
    If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
    will be called to attempt to create the table.
    """

    if not self.table:
        raise Exception("table needs to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path  # remove parentheses here
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```

With this change, the `self.s3_load_path` is no longer called as a function, and the TypeError should be resolved.
