Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the given code lies in calling the `init_copy` method, which is not defined in the provided code. Also, the `self.init_copy(connection)` should be replaced with `self.copy(cursor, path)` as it seems that the intended functionality is to call the `copy` method with the cursor and path parameters.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
1. The `init_copy` method is not defined in the given code. It is likely a typo, and the original intention was to call the `copy` method instead.
2. There are multiple occurrences of the `copy` method, and it is unclear which one should be called in the `run` method.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Replace `self.init_copy(connection)` with `self.copy(cursor, path)` to ensure that the correct method is called.
2. Remove the duplicate definition of the `copy` and `output` methods in the provided code since they appear multiple times.

Corrected Code:
```python
def run(self):
    if not (self.table):
        raise Exception("table needs to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path()
    connection = self.output().connect()
    
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.copy(cursor, path)  # Assuming this is the correct method to call
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```
