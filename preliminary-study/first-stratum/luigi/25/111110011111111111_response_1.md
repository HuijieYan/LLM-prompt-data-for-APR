The error occurred at `path = self.s3_load_path()`, where the `s3_load_path` attribute is being called as a method, but it is actually a string.

To fix the bug, the `s3_load_path` attribute should be accessed directly without the parentheses, as it is a string attribute and not a callable method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the fixed function
def run(self):
    """
    If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
    will be called to attempt to create the table.
    """
    
    if not (self.table):
        raise Exception("table needs to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path  # accessing the attribute directly
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```

By accessing `self.s3_load_path` directly, without the parentheses, the bug is fixed, and the TypeError should no longer occur.
