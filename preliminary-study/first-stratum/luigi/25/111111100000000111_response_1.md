The error is occurring in the `S3CopyToTable.run` function, specifically at the line where `path = self.s3_load_path()` is called. The error message indicates a `TypeError: 'str' object is not callable`, suggesting that `self.s3_load_path` is being treated as a string rather than a function.

The reason for this bug is that `self.s3_load_path` is being reassigned as a parameter within the `MyRedshiftTask` class, effectively overriding the `s3_load_path` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to either rename the parameter in the `MyRedshiftTask` class to something else, or to rename the function in the `S3CopyToTable` class to avoid the conflict.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable):
    """
    Template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from s3.
    
    Usage:
    
    * Subclass and override the required attributes:
      * `host`,
      * `database`,
      * `user`,
      * `password`,
      * `table`,
      * `columns`,
      * `aws_access_key_id`,
      * `aws_secret_access_key`,
      * `s3_load_path`.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def s3_load_path_method(self):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # ... other function definitions ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def run(self):
        """
        If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
        will be called to attempt to create the table.
        """

        
        if not (self.table):
            raise Exception("table need to be specified")
    
        path = self.s3_load_path_method()
        connection = self.output().connect()
        if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
            # try creating table
            logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
            connection.reset()
            self.create_table(connection)
        elif self.do_truncate_table():
            logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
            self.truncate_table(connection)
    
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        self.init_copy(connection)
        self.copy(cursor, path)
        self.output().touch(connection)
        connection.commit()
    
        # commit and clean up
        connection.close()
``` 

In the corrected code, the `s3_load_path` function has been renamed to `s3_load_path_method` to avoid conflicts with the parameter in the `MyRedshiftTask` class.
