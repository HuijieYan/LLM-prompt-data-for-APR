The error occurs at the line `path = self.s3_load_path()` in the `run` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class. The error message indicates a `TypeError` with the message `'str' object is not callable`.

The reason behind this error is that the `s3_load_path` function is assigned a value of type `str` instead of being defined as a method. This causes the error when the `run` method attempts to call `self.s3_load_path()` as if it were a method.

To fix this issue, the `s3_load_path` attribute in the `S3CopyToTable` class should be defined as a method that returns the S3 path. The correct implementation is provided below:

```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable):
    # ... other methods ...

    def s3_load_path(self):
        # Implementation to obtain the S3 path
        return self.s3_path  # Example: replace `s3_path` with the actual attribute name

    def run(self):
        # ... other parts of the run method ...

        path = self.s3_load_path()  # Call the method to obtain S3 path

        # ... rest of the run method ...
```

By defining the `s3_load_path` method within the `S3CopyToTable` class, it can now be called within the `run` method without raising a `TypeError`.
