The bug occurs at the line `path = self.s3_load_path()`. The error message `TypeError: 'str' object is not callable` indicates that `self.s3_load_path` is being treated as a method/function, but it is actually a string.

The reason behind this bug is that `self.s3_load_path` is incorrectly being accessed as if it were a method, when it is actually a parameter.

To fix this bug, the code should be updated to directly use the value of `self.s3_load_path` without treating it as a method.

Here's the corrected code for the `run` method:

```python
def run(self):
    
    if not (self.table):
        raise Exception("table need to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path  # Update this line to directly use the parameter
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```
