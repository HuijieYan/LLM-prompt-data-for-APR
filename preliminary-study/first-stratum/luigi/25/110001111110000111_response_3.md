The error occurs in the `run` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class. The error message indicates that `self.s3_load_path` is a string, but it is being called as a function, leading to a TypeError.

The reason for the error is that `self.s3_load_path` is assigned the value of a string, but it is being invoked as a function using parentheses `()`.

To fix the bug, the value of `self.s3_load_path` should be accessed directly without calling it as a function.

Here's the corrected code for the `run` method:

```python
def run(self):
    """
    If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
    will be called to attempt to create the table.
    """
    if not self.table:
        raise Exception("table needs to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path  # Access the value directly without calling as a function
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```

In this corrected code, the value of `self.s3_load_path` is accessed directly without trying to call it as a function, resolving the TypeError.
