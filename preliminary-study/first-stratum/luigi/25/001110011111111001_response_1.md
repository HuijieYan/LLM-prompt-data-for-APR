1. The error occurs when the `run` method is called on the `DummyS3CopyToTable` object in the test function. The error message indicates a `TypeError` with the message " 'str' object is not callable", which suggests that the `s3_load_path` attribute is being treated as a callable (i.e., a function) but it is actually a string.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `path = self.s3_load_path()`.

3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `s3_load_path` attribute is intended to store a string representing the path to the location in Amazon S3 from which to load data, but it is mistakenly being treated as a method or function that can be called. This is why the error message indicates that a 'str' object (string) is not callable.

4. To fix the bug, the `s3_load_path` attribute should be accessed directly as a string rather than being called as a method. This requires modifying the line `path = self.s3_load_path()` to directly reference the attribute like `path = self.s3_load_path`.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
    def run(self):
        """
        If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
        will be called to attempt to create the table.
        """
        if not (self.table):
            raise Exception("table need to be specified")
    
        path = self.s3_load_path
        connection = self.output().connect()
        if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
            # try creating table
            logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
            connection.reset()
            self.create_table(connection)
        elif self.do_truncate_table():
            logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
            self.truncate_table(connection)
    
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        self.init_copy(connection)
        self.copy(cursor, path)
        self.output().touch(connection)
        connection.commit()
    
        # commit and clean up
        connection.close()
```

In the corrected code, the `s3_load_path` attribute is accessed directly without being called as a method, resolving the `TypeError` issue.
