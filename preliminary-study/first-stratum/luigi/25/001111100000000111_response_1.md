The error message "TypeError: 'str' object is not callable" indicates that the `self.s3_load_path()` is being treated as a callable function, but it is a string type instead.

The potential error location is in the `run` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class.

The bug occurred because the `s3_load_path` was defined as a class property (parameter) in the `MyRedshiftTask` class. When `S3CopyToTable` class calls `self.s3_load_path()`, it is trying to call a string instead of a function, which results in a TypeError.

To fix the bug, the `s3_load_path` parameter should be passed to the `S3CopyToTable` class constructor and then accessed as a property, rather than a method.

Here's the corrected code for the `S3CopyToTable` class:

```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable):
    # ... (other methods)

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super(S3CopyToTable, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.path = self.s3_load_path

    # this is the fixed function
    def run(self):
        
        if not (self.table):
            raise Exception("table need to be specified")
    
        connection = self.output().connect()
        
        if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
            # try creating table
            logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
            connection.reset()
            self.create_table(connection)
        elif self.do_truncate_table():
            logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
            self.truncate_table(connection)
    
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", self.path)
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        self.init_copy(connection)
        self.copy(cursor, self.path)
        self.output().touch(connection)
        connection.commit()
    
        # commit and clean up
        connection.close()
```

With this fix, the `s3_load_path` parameter from `MyRedshiftTask` class is passed to the `S3CopyToTable` constructor and accessed as a property `self.path` within the `run` method. This should resolve the TypeError issue.
