From the error message and the provided test case, it seems that the `TypeError: 'str' object is not callable` is occurring when trying to call `self.s3_load_path()` on line 166. This suggests that `self.s3_load_path` is being treated as a string instead of a method.

The reason behind this bug is that the `s3_load_path` is being set as a class attribute instead of a method. This is why it is being referenced as a string instead of being callable.

To fix the bug, `s3_load_path` should be defined as a method instead of a class attribute. This will allow it to be called as a function and prevent the TypeError.

Here's the corrected code for the `run` method with the fixed `s3_load_path` method:

```python
def run(self):

    if not (self.table):
        raise Exception("table need to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path()  # assuming s3_load_path is a method
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```

By defining `s3_load_path` as a method and calling it using `self.s3_load_path()` in the `run` method, the TypeError should be resolved.
