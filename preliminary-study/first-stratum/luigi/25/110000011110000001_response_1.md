Potential error location: The error occurs at `path = self.s3_load_path()` in the `run` method of the `DummyS3CopyToTable` class.

Reason for the bug: The error message indicates that a "TypeError: 'str' object is not callable" is occurring. This suggests that `self.s3_load_path` is being treated as a callable (function) when it is actually a string, leading to the TypeError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Check the definition of `self.s3_load_path` to ensure that it is not mistakenly defined as a string when it should be a callable method.
2. Verify whether `self.s3_load_path` should be a method that returns the path, and if so, correct its definition.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def run(self):
    """
    If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
    will be called to attempt to create the table.
    """
    
    if not (self.table):
        raise Exception("table need to be specified")

    # Assuming s3_load_path is a method that returns the path
    path = self.s3_load_path()
    connection = self.output().connect()
    
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```
