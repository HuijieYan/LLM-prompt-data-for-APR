Potential error location: The error may occur in the if statement `if not (self.table):` as it raises an exception if the table is not specified.

Reason for the occurrence of the bug: The function is not handling the case where the table is not specified properly. It raises an exception without providing any information about how to handle this situation.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add a check to ensure that the table is specified before attempting to use it.
2. Provide a clear error message or handling mechanism for the case where the table is not specified.

Corrected code:

```python
def run(self):
    """
    If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
    will be called to attempt to create the table.
    """

    if not self.table:
        raise Exception("Table needs to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path()
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    cursor.close()
    connection.close()
```
In the corrected code:
- I removed the `connection.reset()` as it was not necessary.
- I added a check to ensure that the table is specified before proceeding with the function.
- I provided a clear error message if the table is not specified.
