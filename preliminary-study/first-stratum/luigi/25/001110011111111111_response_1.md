The error occurs because the `s3_load_path` attribute is being called as a function, but it is actually defined as a string in the `S3CopyToTable` class. This is evident from the error message `TypeError: 'str' object is not callable`.

To fix this bug, the `S3CopyToTable` class needs to be modified so that the `s3_load_path` attribute is accessed directly as a property rather than being called as a function.

The corrected code for the `run` method is as follows:

```python
def run(self):
    if not (self.table):
        raise Exception("table needs to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path  # accessing the attribute directly
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```

With this change, the `s3_load_path` attribute is accessed directly without being called as a function, fixing the TypeError that was occurring.
