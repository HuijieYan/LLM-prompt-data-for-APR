1. The error message indicates that a TypeError occurred because a 'str' object is being called. This is happening in the `run` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi.contrib.redshift` file.

2. The potential error location is within the `run` method where `self.s3_load_path()` is being called.

3. The reason for the TypeError is that `self.s3_load_path` is likely being assigned a string value somewhere in the code, and then it's being called as a function in the `run` method.

4. To fix the bug, it's necessary to ensure that `self.s3_load_path` is assigned a function, not a string value.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def run(self):
    if not (self.table):
        raise Exception("table needs to be specified")
    
    path = self.s3_load_path()  # Calling the function
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)
    
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()
    
    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```
