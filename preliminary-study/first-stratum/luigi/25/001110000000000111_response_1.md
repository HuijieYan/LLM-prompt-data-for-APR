The error occurs in the `run` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class. The error message "TypeError: 'str' object is not callable" indicates that the `s3_load_path` attribute is being treated as a function/method when it is actually a string.

The reason behind this bug is that the `s3_load_path` attribute is defined as a string parameter in the `MyRedshiftTask` class, but in the `S3CopyToTable` class, it is being called as a method.

One possible approach to fix this bug is to remove the parentheses when accessing the `s3_load_path` attribute in the `run` method. This will ensure that the attribute is treated as a string and not a method.

Here's the corrected code for the `run` method:

```python
# this is the corrected run method
def run(self):
    
    if not (self.table):
        raise Exception("table need to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path  # remove parentheses
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```
