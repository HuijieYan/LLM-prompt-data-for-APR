The error is occurring in the line `path = self.s3_load_path()`, where `self.s3_load_path` is being called as a function when it is actually a string type. The attributes `self.output`, `self.does_table_exist`, `self.create_table`, `self.do_truncate_table`, and `self.init_copy` are all methods, so they are not called directly using the parentheses. However, `self.s3_load_path` is a parameter that is being incorrectly called as a function.

To fix this bug, the line `path = self.s3_load_path()` should be changed to `path = self.s3_load_path`. This will correctly assign the value of `s3_load_path` to the variable `path` without trying to call it as a function.

Here's the corrected code for the `run` method:

```python
def run(self):
    """
    If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
    will be called to attempt to create the table.
    """

    if not self.table:
        raise Exception("table needs to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```

By making this change, the TypeError should be resolved and the `run` method should behave as expected.
