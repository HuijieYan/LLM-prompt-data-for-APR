The error occurs at line 166 in the `run` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class. The error message indicates that `self.s3_load_path()` is being called as a function, but it is a `str` type and not callable.

The reason for this bug is that the `s3_load_path` attribute is defined as a parameter in the `MyRedshiftTask` class, and it is also overridden in the `S3CopyToTable` class. When the `run` method tries to call `self.s3_load_path()`, it mistakenly tries to call the string as a function, resulting in the TypeError.

To fix this bug, the `s3_load_path` attribute should be accessed directly as a string, rather than attempting to call it as a function. This can be simply achieved by removing the parentheses when accessing the attribute.

Here's the corrected code for the `run` method in the `S3CopyToTable` class:

```python
def run(self):
    """
    If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
    will be called to attempt to create the table.
    """

    
    if not (self.table):
        raise Exception("table need to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```
