The potential error location within the `run` function is at the following line:
```python
if not (self.table):
    raise Exception("table need to be specified")
```
The bug occurs because the condition being checked is whether `self.table` exists or not, and if it does not, then an exception is raised. This condition is not checking whether `self.table` is empty or not, which is the intended behavior. Instead, it is checking if `self.table` exists at all, which may not be the correct behavior.

To fix the bug, the condition should be changed to check if `self.table` is empty or not:
```python
if not self.table:
    raise Exception("Table needs to be specified")
```
With this change, the function will correctly check if the `table` attribute has been specified and raise an exception if it has not.

Here's the corrected `run` function:

```python
def run(self):
    """
    If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
    will be called to attempt to create the table.
    """

    
    if not self.table:
        raise Exception("Table needs to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path()
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```
