The potential error location within the `run` function is the condition `if not (self.table):`. The intention seems to be to check if the `table` attribute has been specified, but the condition is incorrectly checking if the `table` attribute exists rather than if it has been assigned a value.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the condition is using the wrong check. Instead of checking if the attribute exists, it should be checking if the attribute has been assigned a value.

To fix the bug, the condition should be updated to check if `self.table` has been assigned a value using the `is None` or `==` comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the `run` function:

```python
def run(self):
    """
    If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
    will be called to attempt to create the table.
    """
    if self.table is None:  # Check if self.table has been assigned a value
        raise Exception("table needs to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path()
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```
