The potential error in the provided code is that the function "run" is using some methods like s3_load_path, does_table_exist, create_table, truncate_table, init_copy, and copy without the self keyword, indicating that these methods are meant to be part of the class but are not being called correctly as instance methods.

The reason for the bug is that the methods are not being called as instance methods, and therefore they cannot access the instance variables and attributes of the class.

To fix this bug, we need to make sure that these methods are defined as instance methods within the class.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def run(self):
        
    if not (self.table):
        raise Exception("table need to be specified")
    
    path = self.s3_load_path()
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)
    
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()
    
    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```
