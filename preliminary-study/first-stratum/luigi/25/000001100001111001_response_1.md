The potential error in the `run` function is that the function is trying to call `self.s3_load_path()` without the `self` keyword. Additionally, the function `init_copy` is being called, but there is no such function defined in the provided code.

The reason for the bug is that in Python, when calling a method within the class, we need to use `self` to refer to the instance of the class. Also, there seems to be a missing function `init_copy` which is being called in the provided code.

To fix the bug, we need to add the `self` keyword before `s3_load_path()` and if `init_copy` is intended to be a method of the class, it should be defined within the class.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def run(self):
    if not self.table:
        raise Exception("table needs to be specified")
    
    # Using self keyword to call the method
    path = self.s3_load_path()
    connection = self.output().connect()
    
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)
    
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()

    # Assuming init_copy is a member function, otherwise, it needs to be defined
    # Note: init_copy needs to be defined within the class if it's intended to be a method
    self.init_copy(connection)

    # Continue with the rest of the code
    # ...
    # ...

    # Commit and clean up
    connection.commit()
    connection.close()
```
