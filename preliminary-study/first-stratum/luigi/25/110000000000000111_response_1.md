The error message "TypeError: 'str' object is not callable" indicates that the variable `self.s3_load_path` is being treated as a callable function, but it's actually a string. 

The potential error location is within the line `path = self.s3_load_path()`, where `self.s3_load_path` is being treated as a callable function by using `()` after it.

The reason for the bug is that `self.s3_load_path` is intended to be a string representing a path, not a function.

To fix the bug, simply remove the `()` from `self.s3_load_path` so that it's treated as a string:

```python
path = self.s3_load_path
```

By making this change, the code will correctly use the string value of `self.s3_load_path` as the path to be used.

Here is the corrected code for the `run` function, with the fix applied:

```python
def run(self):
    if not (self.table):
        raise Exception("table need to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```
