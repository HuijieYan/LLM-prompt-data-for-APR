The error message indicates a TypeError at line 166 of the `run` method in the `S3CopyToTable` class. The error occurs when trying to call the `s3_load_path` attribute as a function (`self.s3_load_path()`), which is incorrect because `self.s3_load_path` is of type `str`.

The error occurred because the code was trying to call a string object as a function (i.e., `self.s3_load_path()`), which resulted in a TypeError. The `s3_load_path` attribute should be accessed directly as an attribute of the class, not called as a function.

To fix the bug, the line in the `run` method that tries to call `self.s3_load_path()` as a function should be updated to access the `s3_load_path` attribute directly as shown below:

```python
path = self.s3_load_path  # Fixed line
```

Here's the corrected code for the `run` method in the `S3CopyToTable` class:

```python
def run(self):
    if not self.table:
        raise Exception("table needs to be specified")
    
    path = self.s3_load_path  # Fix the line by accessing the attribute directly
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)
    
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()
    
    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```

The fix involves simply modifying the line that caused the TypeError and removing the parentheses, which treated `self.s3_load_path` as a function call. After making this change, the bug should be resolved, and the function should work as expected.
