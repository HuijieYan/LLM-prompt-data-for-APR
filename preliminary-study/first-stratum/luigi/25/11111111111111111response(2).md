The error is occurring at the line `path = self.s3_load_path()` in the `run` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class. The error message indicates that `self.s3_load_path` is being treated as a string instead of a callable object, resulting in a `TypeError`.

The reason behind the bug is that `self.s3_load_path` is being incorrectly referenced as a method by adding parentheses at the end, which treats it as a callable object. This is incorrect because `s3_load_path` is defined as a parameter/attribute, not a method, in the `S3CopyToTable` class.

To fix this bug, the line `path = self.s3_load_path()` should be replaced with `path = self.s3_load_path` in the `run` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class.

Here's the corrected code for the `run` method:

```python
def run(self):
    """
    If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
    will be called to attempt to create the table.
    """

    
    if not (self.table):
        raise Exception("table need to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```

This fix ensures that `self.s3_load_path` is treated as an attribute/parameter instead of a callable object, resolving the `TypeError` that was occurring.
