The error is occurring because the `self.s3_load_path` variable is being called as a function (`self.s3_load_path()`), but it is defined as a parameter in the class. This is causing a `TypeError` because a string object cannot be called as a function.

To fix this issue, the `self.s3_load_path()` should be replaced with `self.s3_load_path` (without parentheses) in the `run` function.

Here is the corrected code for the `run` function:

```python
def run(self):
    if not (self.table):
        raise Exception("table need to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```

With this change, the `TypeError` should be resolved, and the function should work as expected.
