The error occurs at line 166 of the code, which is `path = self.s3_load_path()`. The error message indicates that a TypeError is being raised and it suggests that a string is not callable.

The occurrence of the bug is due to the incorrect use of the parentheses `()` after `self.s3_load_path`. This indicates that the code is trying to call a string as a function, which is not allowed.

To fix the bug, remove the parentheses from `self.s3_load_path` and update the code to use it as a variable instead of a method call. This will ensure that the string value assigned to `s3_load_path` is used correctly.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def run(self):
    
    if not (self.table):
        raise Exception("table need to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```
