The error message "TypeError: 'str' object is not callable" indicates that the code is trying to call the `s3_load_path` attribute as a function, but it is actually a string. This is likely happening on this line in the `run` function:
```python
path = self.s3_load_path()
```
The reason for this bug is that `s3_load_path` is defined as a parameter in the `MyRedshiftTask` class, and in `S3CopyToTable` it is trying to call it as a function.

To fix this bug, the `s3_load_path` attribute should be accessed as a property rather than calling it as a function.

Here's the corrected code for the `S3CopyToTable` class:

```python
# corrected S3CopyToTable class
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable):

    # ... (other methods)

    # this is the corrected run function
    def run(self):
        """
        If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
        will be called to attempt to create the table.
        """
        if not self.table:
            raise Exception("table needs to be specified")
    
        path = self.s3_load_path  # access as property, not as function
        connection = self.output().connect()
        if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
            # try creating table
            logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
            connection.reset()
            self.create_table(connection)
        elif self.do_truncate_table():
            logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
            self.truncate_table(connection)
    
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        self.init_copy(connection)
        self.copy(cursor, path)
        self.output().touch(connection)
        connection.commit()
    
        # commit and clean up
        connection.close()
```

By accessing `s3_load_path` as a property instead of calling it as a function, the TypeError should be resolved.
