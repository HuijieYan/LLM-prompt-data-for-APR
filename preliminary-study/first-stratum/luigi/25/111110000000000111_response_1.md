The error message "TypeError: 'str' object is not callable" indicates that the function `self.s3_load_path()` is being treated as a callable function, but it is actually a string. This suggests that the variable `self.s3_load_path` is being improperly accessed.

The bug likely occurs on the line `path = self.s3_load_path()`, where the `self.s3_load_path` variable is mistakenly called as a function. 

To fix this bug, we need to remove the parentheses `()` after `self.s3_load_path`, as it is not a function but a string attribute.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def run(self):
        """
        If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
        will be called to attempt to create the table.
        """

        
        if not (self.table):
            raise Exception("table need to be specified")
    
        path = self.s3_load_path  # Corrected line
        connection = self.output().connect()
        if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
            # try creating table
            logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
            connection.reset()
            self.create_table(connection)
        elif self.do_truncate_table():
            logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
            self.truncate_table(connection)
    
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        self.init_copy(connection)
        self.copy(cursor, path)
        self.output().touch(connection)
        connection.commit()
    
        # commit and clean up
        connection.close()
```
