The error is occurring in the `run` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class. Specifically, the error is happening at `path = self.s3_load_path()`, where `self.s3_load_path` is a string and not a method that can be called. This indicates that there might be a misunderstanding in how `self.s3_load_path` is being used.

The error occurs because `self.s3_load_path` is being treated as a method instead of a simple attribute. 

To fix the bug, the reference to `self.s3_load_path` should be modified to access the value directly as an attribute, rather than trying to call it as a method.

Here's the corrected code for the `run` method:

```python
def run(self):
    
    if not self.table:
        raise Exception("table needs to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path  # accessing the attribute directly 
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```

By making this change, the code will access the `s3_load_path` attribute directly without trying to call it as a method, which was causing the TypeError.
