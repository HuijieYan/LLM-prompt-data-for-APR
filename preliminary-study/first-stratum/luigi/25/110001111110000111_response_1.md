The error message "TypeError: 'str' object is not callable" in the test function indicates that there is an issue with calling the `s3_load_path` attribute as if it were a function in the `run` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class. This error occurs because `s3_load_path` is being treated as a callable (a function) when it is actually a string attribute.

To fix this issue, it's important to understand that the `s3_load_path` attribute is not a function, but a string that represents the path to an S3 location.

The bug occurs in the `run` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class when `self.s3_load_path()` is called. It should be corrected to `self.s3_load_path` to retrieve the path as a string attribute.

To fix this bug, the code for the `run` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class should be corrected as follows:

```python
def run(self):
    """
    If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
    will be called to attempt to create the table.
    """
    
    if not self.table:
        raise Exception("table needs to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```

By making this change, the `s3_load_path` attribute will be accessed as a string, and the TypeError will be resolved.
