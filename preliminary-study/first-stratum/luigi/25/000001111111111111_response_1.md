The error seems to be occurring when the `run` method of the `DummyS3CopyToTable` class is called. Specifically, the line `path = self.s3_load_path()` is causing a TypeError: 'str' object is not callable.

The reason for this error is that `self.s3_load_path` has been defined as a parameter of the class, and it is being called as a method in the `run` function. This means that `self.s3_load_path` is being treated as a string and is being called as a function, which is not allowed in Python.

To fix this bug, you need to remove the parentheses when calling `self.s3_load_path` in the `run` method, as follows:

```python
path = self.s3_load_path
```

By doing this, you're referencing the value of `self.s3_load_path` instead of trying to call it as a function.

Here's the corrected `run` method:

```python
def run(self):
    if not self.table:
        raise Exception("table needs to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path
    connection = self.output().connect()
    
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)
    
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()
    
    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```

With this change, the `TypeError` should no longer occur, and the functionality of the `run` method should be preserved.
