The error occurs because the `s3_load_path` attribute is being called as a function within the `run` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class, leading to the `TypeError: 'str' object is not callable` error message.

The reason for the bug is that the `s3_load_path` attribute is being treated as a method due to the parentheses `()` after its reference. However, it is actually defined as a string attribute in the class declaration.

To fix the bug, we should remove the parentheses when calling the `s3_load_path` attribute within the `run` method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected run function
def run(self):
    if not self.table:
        raise Exception("table needs to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path  # corrected line
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```

With this correction, the `TypeError` should be resolved. The `s3_load_path` attribute is now being accessed as a string property rather than being called as a function.
