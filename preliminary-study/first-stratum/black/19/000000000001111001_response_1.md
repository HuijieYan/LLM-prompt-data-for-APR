The bug in the given `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to how the function computes the number of empty lines to be inserted based on the input `current_line` and some other conditions.

The bug arises from the incorrect handling of the condition for checking if `current_line.is_yield` and `depth != self.previous_line.depth`. The existing logic does not correctly handle these conditions, leading to incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, the logic for checking `current_line.is_yield` and the comparison of `depth` with the previous line's depth needs to be adjusted to ensure the correct number of empty lines is returned.

Below is the corrected function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

class Line:
    def __init__(self, depth, leaves):
        self.depth = depth
        self.leaves = leaves
        self.is_decorator = False
        self.is_def = False
        self.is_class = False
        self.is_flow_control = False
        self.is_import = False
        self.is_yield = False

class Leaf:
    def __init__(self, leaf_type, name):
        self.leaf_type = leaf_type
        self.name = name
        self.prefix = ""

class EmptyLineTracker:
    def __init__(self, previous_line, previous_after, previous_defs):
        self.previous_line = previous_line
        self.previous_after = previous_after
        self.previous_defs = previous_defs

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the above corrected code, the conditions related to `current_line.is_yield` and the comparison of `depth` with the previous line's depth have been adjusted to ensure the correct computation of the number of empty lines to be inserted.
