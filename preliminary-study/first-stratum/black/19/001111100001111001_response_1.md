The potential error in the given function arises due to the incorrect handling of the `is_decorator` attribute. It seems that the function is not considering the `is_decorator` attribute correctly when determining the number of newlines to return. The logic within the `if is_decorator` block is incorrect, and it doesn't properly account for the newlines in the given cases.

To fix the bug, the function should accurately detect the presence of decorators, `is_def`, `is_class`, and `is_flow_control` and determine the necessary number of newlines based on these conditions.

Here's the corrected code for the given function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

This corrected function should appropriately handle the cases described and provide the correct output based on the conditions in the code.
