The bug occurs in the `_maybe_empty_lines` method of the `EmptyLineTracker` class. This method is supposed to return the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. However, there are several issues with the code.

1. The logic inside the method is complex, making it difficult to follow and prone to errors.
2. There are multiple conditional statements that make the code difficult to reason about, potentially leading to incorrect outputs in different scenarios.

To fix the code, the complex logic within the method should be broken down into smaller, more manageable parts. This will make it easier to understand and debug.

Here's the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` method:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    after = 0

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    else:
        max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        else:
            return 1, 0

    if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line and not self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is not None:
            return 1, 0
        return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return 1, 0

    return before, after
```

In the corrected code, the conditional logic has been simplified and broken down into smaller, more manageable parts. This should make the method more reliable and easier to maintain.
