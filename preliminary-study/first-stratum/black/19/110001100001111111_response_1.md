Based on the provided buggy function, it seems that the function `_maybe_empty_lines` is designed to handle some logic related to new lines and indentation levels. However, there are several issues within it, including missing return values, unnecessary conditions, and incorrect variable assignments.

The potential error locations within the code include:
1. The condition checks for current_line.is_flow_control, self.previous_line.is_import, and self.previous_line.is_yield do not return correct values or do not cover all possible cases.
2. The logic within the conditions related to is_decorator, is_def, and is_class could be causing incorrect behaviors.
3. The variables newlines and is_decorator are defined but not used or returned.
4. The use of self.previous_defs seems inconsistent and may cause unexpected results.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bugs are likely related to improper handling of conditional checks and variable assignments. The code's logic also seems to have inconsistencies in the conditions and their corresponding operations.

To fix the bugs, the problematic conditional checks need to be revisited and the associated logic should be updated. Also, the logic for handling self.previous_defs should be reviewed to ensure it aligns with the expected behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth != 0 else 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if (current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class) and not current_line.is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line and not (self.previous_line.is_decorator or 
            (self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import) or 
            (self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth))):
            return 2 - int(bool(current_line.depth)), 0
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    elif (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and 
            depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    else:
        return before, 0
```

In the corrected code, I've revisited the conditions and their corresponding logic to handle new lines and indentation levels properly. I've also ensured that the function returns the expected values for tuples and handles the depth conditions appropriately. Additionally, I've removed the unused variables and revised the self.previous_defs logic for clarity and correctness.
