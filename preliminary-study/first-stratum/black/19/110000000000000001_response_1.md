The potential error in the code is in the logic for determining the number of empty lines to return. The code has multiple if-else conditions to check for different scenarios and return the number of empty lines accordingly. However, the logic seems to be convoluted and has conditional statements that may not be necessary.

The possible approach for fixing the bug is to simplify the logic and remove unnecessary conditional statements. We can consolidate the conditions and combine them where possible to reduce redundancy.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
        return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        else:
            newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
            return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (self.previous_line and 
        self.previous_line.is_import and 
        not current_line.is_import and 
        current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (self.previous_line and 
        self.previous_line.is_yield and 
        (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
