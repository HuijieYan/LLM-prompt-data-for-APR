Potential error location: The buggy function seems to be incorrectly handling the maximum number of allowed empty lines based on the depth of the current line. This may be causing the output to have extra or fewer empty lines than expected.

Reasons for the bug: The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of the maximum allowed empty lines for certain line types. In some cases, the function is not properly considering the depth of the current line to determine the maximum number of allowed empty lines.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the function correctly calculates the maximum allowed empty lines based on the depth of the current line and the line types.
2. Check the conditions where the maximum allowed empty lines are being set and make sure they match the expected behavior.
3. Verify the handling of different line types (decorators, flow control, imports, yield, etc.) and make necessary adjustments to the empty line calculation based on these types.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
from typing import Tuple

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return 1, 0
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return 1, 0
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
    if current_line.leaves and len(current_line.leaves) > 0:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
    return before, 0
