The code is meant to handle the number of empty lines to be added before a given line based on various conditions. The main issue with the current function is that it is returning a two-item tuple, but in some cases, it is actually returning a three-item tuple which causes an error.

Based on the observed input and expected output, the main issue might lie in the return statements. In the cases provided, the function is expected to return a tuple of two integers, but in some cases, it is returning a tuple with three values, which causes a mismatch.

To resolve this issue, the return statements need to be revised to ensure they always return a tuple of two integers. Additionally, it's worth revisiting the logic to ensure that the correct values are being returned based on the various conditions.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected code, the return statements have been revised to always return a tuple of two integers, ensuring consistency in the return type. Additionally, the conditionals have been carefully reviewed to ensure that the correct values are returned based on the specified conditions.
