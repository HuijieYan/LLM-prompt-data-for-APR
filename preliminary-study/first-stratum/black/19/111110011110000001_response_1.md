The `test_comment_in_decorator` method is failing with an `AssertionError`. It seems the issue is related to the formatting of comments within a decorator in the source code.

The potential error location within the `_maybe_empty_lines` method is not immediately clear without additional context.

The bug occurs because the `_maybe_empty_lines` method is not correctly handling the insertion of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. This impacts the formatting and placement of comments, resulting in the AssertionError in the test method.

To fix the bug, the `_maybe_empty_lines` method should be modified to accurately determine the number of empty lines to be inserted before and after the currently processed line based on various conditions, such as line depth, presence of decorators, flow control, imports, etc.

Here's the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` method:

```python
from typing import Tuple

# class declaration containing the buggy function
@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    """
    Provides a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra
    empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
    
    Note: this tracker works on lines that haven't been split yet.  It assumes
    the prefix of the first leaf consists of optional newlines.  Those newlines
    are consumed by `maybe_empty_lines()` and included in the computation.
    """

    # this is the corrected function
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
        if depth == 0:
            before = 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, before
            elif self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, before
            else:
                newlines = 1
                if current_line.depth:
                    newlines = 0
                return newlines, before
        
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return before, 0
        
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return before, 0
        
        return before, 0
```

The corrected code takes into consideration the different conditions under which empty lines should be inserted before and after the currently processed line, addressing the formatting issue observed in the test case.
