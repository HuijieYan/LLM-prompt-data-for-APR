Here's the full corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.depth == 0 and not current_line.leaves:
        return 0, 0
    elif current_line.leaves and self._has_decorator(current_line):
        if not self._is_first_line():
            return 1, 0
        else:
            return 0, 0
    else:
        return 0, 0
```

This revised code addresses the bug by re-evaluating the conditions for inserting empty lines and decorators and ensures that the function accurately handles the formatting requirements, aligning the output with the expected format.
