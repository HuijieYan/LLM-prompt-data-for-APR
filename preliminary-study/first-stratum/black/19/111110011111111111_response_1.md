The error message indicates that the number of empty lines is not as expected in the test case.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic for computing the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be the incorrect calculation of empty lines based on the different conditions and flags that are checked within the function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Review the logic for computing the number of empty lines and ensure that it aligns with the expected behavior based on the input parameters and conditions.
2. Check the conditions for adjusting the number of empty lines before and after the current line and make sure they are correctly applied.
3. Consider using separate variables for tracking the number of empty lines before and after, to avoid confusion and potential errors.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth > 0 else 2
    before = 0
    newlines = 0
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
    
        if self.previous_line is not None and not self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            newlines = 2 if current_line.depth > 0 else 1
        else:
            newlines = 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0
    
    return before, newlines
```

This corrected function attempts to address the potential issues by restructuring the logic for computing the number of empty lines before and after the current line.
