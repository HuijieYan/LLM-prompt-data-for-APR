The `assertFormatEqual` function in the test is comparing the expected output with the actual output and throwing an `AssertionError` because the two outputs don't match.

The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is causing this discrepancy. The function is responsible for handling cases where empty lines need to be inserted in the output. The discrepancies in the output are likely due to incorrect handling of these cases.

Upon analyzing the code, it seems that the `newlines` variable is not correctly computed for some conditional branches. Additionally, the logic for handling empty lines before or after certain types of lines might be flawed.

To fix the bug, the logic for computing `newlines` should be revisited to ensure it correctly handles all possible scenarios. Also, the logic for inserting empty lines before or after certain types of lines should be carefully reviewed.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import(self)
        and not current_line.is_import(self)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield(self)
        and (not current_line.is_yield(self) or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
