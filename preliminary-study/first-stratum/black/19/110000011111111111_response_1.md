The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function results in the incorrect handling of new lines in the code. This is causing the `assertFormatEqual` test to fail because the expected and actual outputs have different line structures.

The potential error location within the function is the logic for handling decorators, imports, and yields. These sections of code determine the number of newlines to be added or handled before and after specific code constructs.

The bug seems to occur due to incorrect logic in determining the number of newlines to be added in specific situations. The conditional statements that handle decorators, imports, and yields are not properly accounting for the number of newlines to be inserted. This results in a mismatch between the expected and actual outputs.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling decorators, imports, and yields needs to be reviewed and corrected. This may involve adjusting the conditional statements to properly calculate the number of newlines required in each situation.

Here's the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        if current_line.depth:
            return 1, 0
        return 2, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
