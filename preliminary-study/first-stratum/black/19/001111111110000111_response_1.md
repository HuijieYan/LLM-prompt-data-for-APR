The error message from the test function indicates that the expected and actual outputs are not equal. This test is likely related to the format of the input source code and its expected output after processing by the `fs` method. The function `fs` may invoke the `_maybe_empty_lines` method which seems to be causing the issue.

Upon closer inspection of the `_maybe_empty_lines` method, it is apparent that the logic within the method is complex and contains potential issues. The logic involves tracking empty lines and line prefixes based on certain conditions related to the input source code.

The bug could be caused by incorrect handling of the line prefixes, including newline characters. The conditions that determine the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line might not be properly implemented.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to carefully review and modify the logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` method. Potential approaches for this include:
1. Checking and adjusting the conditions related to line prefixes and the number of empty lines.
2. Ensuring that the method correctly handles different types of lines and their relationships with previous lines.
3. Testing the method with various input source code samples to verify its correctness.

The corrected `_maybe_empty_lines` method is provided below:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
        
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

This corrected method enhances the handling of line prefixes and adjusts the conditions for determining the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line.
