The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the handling of newlines. 

The function takes in a `current_line` object and calculates the number of newlines that should be added before the given line based on various conditions like whether it's a decorator, a flow control statement, an import, etc.

In the buggy function, there are several issues:
1. The logic for handling `before` and setting `max_allowed` is inconsistent across the cases and may lead to unexpected behavior.
2. Assignment of `newlines` is not properly handled and does not cover all the cases.
3. The condition `before = 1 if depth else 2` seems incorrect and needs further evaluation.

The `return` statements are not properly structured. Additionally, the function does not seem to consider all the conditions properly which may lead to incorrect return values.

To fix this function, we need to ensure that all the conditions are properly handled and return the appropriate number of newlines as per the requirements.

Here's the corrected implementation for the function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if not current_line.leaves:
        before = 0
    else:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    return_statement = (0, 0)  # default return statement

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return_statement = (0, 0)  # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file or between decorators
        else:
            newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
            return_statement = (newlines, 0)
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        return_statement = (before, 1)
    elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return_statement = (before or 1, 0)
    elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return_statement = (before or 1, 0)
    else:
        return_statement = (before, 0)

    return return_statement
```

In the corrected function:
1. `before` is calculated consistently based on leaf prefix.
2. Proper handling and assignment of values for `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, etc.
3. The conditions are properly handled based on the expected behavior.
4. Clear and structured `return` statements are provided for each condition.
