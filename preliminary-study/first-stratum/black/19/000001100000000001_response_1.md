The potential error location within the problematic function is the 'if is_decorator' condition. 

The bug occurs because the condition 'if is_decorator' is not accurately checking whether 'current_line' is a decorator or not. This may result in incorrect handling of empty lines.

To fix the bug, we need to properly check whether 'current_line' is a decorator or not and make sure the condition is accurately evaluating it.

```python
from typing import Tuple

class YourClassName:
    # ... other methods ...

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        
        # Check if the current line is a decorator
        if current_line.is_decorator() or current_line.is_def() or current_line.is_class():
            if not current_line.is_decorator():
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator():
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control():
            return before, 1

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import(self)
            and not current_line.is_import(self)
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield(self)
            and (not current_line.is_yield(self) or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return before, 0
```

In the fixed code:
- The method 'is_decorator()' is called to accurately check if the current line is a decorator.
- Similarly, other methods like 'is_def()', 'is_class()', 'is_flow_control()', 'is_import()', and 'is_yield()' should also be called to correctly evaluate their conditions.
