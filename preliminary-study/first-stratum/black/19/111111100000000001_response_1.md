The potential error location within the problematic `_maybe_empty_lines` function is the use of attributes such as `current_line.is_decorator`, `current_line.is_def`, `current_line.is_class`, `current_line.is_flow_control`, `current_line.is_import`, and `current_line.is_yield` without a proper definition of these attributes and methods. It seems like the previous lines are trying to access attributes and methods of the `current_line` object, which may not have been properly defined or initialized.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code is trying to access attributes and methods of the `current_line` object without a clear definition or initialization of these attributes and methods. This can lead to the code execution failure due to attribute errors or undefined method calls.

To fix the bug, the `current_line` object should have clearly defined attributes and methods such as `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield`. These attributes and methods should be properly defined within the `Line` class or wherever the `current_line` object is defined to ensure that they can be accessed without causing attribute errors.

Additionally, it's important to ensure that the `current_line` object is properly initialized and passed to the `_maybe_empty_lines` method before accessing its attributes and methods.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the fixed _maybe_empty_lines function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    previous_defs = []
    if depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    while previous_defs and previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    if depth:
        before = 1
    newlines = 2 if depth else 1
    return newlines, 0
```

In this corrected code, we are assuming that the `current_line` object has been properly defined and initialized with the necessary attributes and methods. We are also setting the `before` value based on the conditions and removing references to undefined attributes and methods.
