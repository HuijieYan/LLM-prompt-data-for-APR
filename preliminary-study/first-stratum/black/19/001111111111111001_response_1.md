The error message indicates that the function `assertFormatEqual` is failing because the expected and actual outputs are not matching as per the assertion. The difference seems to stem from the comments (`# TODO: X`, `# TODO: Y`, `# TODO: Z`) and the number of empty lines between various parts of the code.

Based on the provided details, it seems that the `EmptyLineTracker` class is responsible for handling the number of empty lines between different types of lines in the code. The issue might be that the `_maybe_empty_lines` method in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is not handling the condition for appending comments or adding empty lines correctly, thus leading to the mismatch in the test results.

To resolve this issue, the `_maybe_empty_lines` method should be revised to accurately handle the insertion of empty lines and comments in the code. This would involve checking for comments and calculating the appropriate number of empty lines based on the code context.

Here is the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` method with the relevant comments and added conditions:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
    # Add check for comments and modify the conditions accordingly
    if current_line.contains_comment():
        return 1, 0
    return before, 0
```

In the corrected method, additional conditions have been added to handle comments and calculate the required number of empty lines appropriately.

However, the exact way of handling comments and empty lines might depend on the specific requirements of the codebase and the expected behavior, and further refinement of the conditions might be necessary to exactly match the expectations.
