The test case is failing because the function `assertFormatEqual` is comparing two strings and finding a mismatch. This indicates that the function `fs` is not producing the expected output, causing the test to fail.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `_maybe_empty_lines` method of the `EmptyLineTracker` class.

The bug is likely occurring due to incorrect logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` method, which is intended to calculate the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.

To fix the bug, the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` method should be carefully reviewed and adjusted to ensure that it accurately calculates the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not self.is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.is_yield(self.previous_line)
        and (not self.is_yield(current_line) or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected code, I made adjustments to the logic to ensure that it accurately calculates the number of potential extra empty lines needed. I also made changes to how the `is_import` and `is_yield` checks are handled within the method.
