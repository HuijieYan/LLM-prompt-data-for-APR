Potential Error Location: 

The issue is likely to be in the section of code that handles the conditions for returning the number of empty lines before and after the current line, depending on the type of line.

Reasons for the Bug: 

The bug occurs because the logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after the current line is not consistently applied. Additionally, there are multiple conditional checks that could lead to incorrect return values.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:

1. Refactor the logic to handle the different cases more consistently and clearly.
2. Ensure that the conditional checks are properly organized and do not conflict with each other.
3. Update the code to handle different line types in a more structured manner.
4. Use meaningful variable names and comments to improve the code readability.

Corrected Code:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0
