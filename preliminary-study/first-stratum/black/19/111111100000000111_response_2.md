The potential error location within the problematic function is in the logic for determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.

The bug occurs because the function `_maybe_empty_lines` has a flawed logic. It incorrectly calculates the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. This includes incorrect handling of depth, decorators, flow control, imports, and yields.

To fix the bug, we can adjust the logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to properly calculate the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. We need to handle the depth, decorators, flow control, imports, and yields correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
import Leaf
import dataclass
import Line
import Tuple

# class declaration containing the corrected function
@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    """
    Provides a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra
    empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
    
    Note: this tracker works on lines that haven't been split yet.  It assumes
    the prefix of the first leaf consists of optional newlines.  Those newlines
    are consumed by `maybe_empty_lines()` and included in the computation.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # the corrected function
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2

        if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if self.previous_line is None:
                return 0, 0
            elif self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0
            else:
                newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
                return newlines, 0
        elif current_line.is_flow_control:
            return 0, 1
        elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return 1, 0
        elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return 1, 0
        else:
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0] if current_line.leaves else None
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n") if first_leaf else 0
            before = min(before, max_allowed) if max_allowed else before
            if current_line.depth in self.previous_defs:
                before = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
            return before, 0
```

In the corrected code, the logic handling decorators, flow control, imports, and yields has been adjusted to return the correct number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. Additionally, the handling of `first_leaf` and `before` has been corrected for proper computation of the number of optional newlines.
