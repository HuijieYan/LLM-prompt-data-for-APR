The bug occurs in the function `_maybe_empty_lines`. The function is expected to return the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line, based on certain conditions. The function seems to be incorrectly handling some of the conditions, leading to incorrect results and the assertion error in the test case.

The error message indicates that the expected and actual values are not equal. It seems that the function is not correctly determining the number of empty lines needed based on the input and the current state.

The potential error locations within the function could be how it handles the conditions related to decorators, imports, and yields.

One approach to fixing the bug could be to carefully review the logic for handling each condition in the function. Make sure that each condition is correctly evaluated and the expected number of empty lines is determined based on the conditions. It's important to consider all possible scenarios and edge cases to ensure the correct number of empty lines is returned.

Below is the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth > 0 else 2
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    depth = current_line.depth
    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth > 0 else 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0
    return before, 0
```

In the corrected code, the logic related to each condition is restructured to accurately determine the number of empty lines based on the input parameters and the current state. This updated logic should address the bug and provide the expected results in the test cases.
