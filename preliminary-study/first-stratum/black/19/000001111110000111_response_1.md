The error occurs when comparing the expected output with the actual output in the test_comment_in_decorator function. The error message indicates a mismatch between the expected and actual outputs.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the logic for handling empty lines. It seems that the logic for inserting empty lines before certain types of lines is causing issues, leading to incorrect output.

The bug occurs because the function _maybe_empty_lines is not correctly handling the insertion of empty lines before specific types of lines. The logic for handling different types of lines and their respective depth is causing unexpected behavior, leading to the test failure.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling empty lines before certain types of lines needs to be rewritten to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is inserted based on the context of the code.

Here's the corrected code for the _maybe_empty_lines function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

class SomeClass:
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
            
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        
        if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not current_line.is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
            
            if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0
            
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
        
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return (before or 1), 0
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return (before or 1), 0
        
        return before, 0
```

The corrected code revises the logic for handling empty lines based on the type of the current line, its depth, and the previous line. This should address the bug and provide the expected behavior for the test case.
