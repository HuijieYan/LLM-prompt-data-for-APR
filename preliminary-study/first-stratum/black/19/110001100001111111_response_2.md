Error:
The function `_maybe_empty_lines` appears to have issues in determining the correct values for variables `newlines` and `before` based on various conditions involving `if` statements and comparisons with different attributes and properties.

Reasons for the bug:
1. The function is not correctly handling all the conditional branches and updating the variables accordingly.
2. There are cases where the function is not returning the expected output as per the input and conditional checks.

Approach for fixing the bug:
1. Review the logic for each conditional block and verify if all possible combinations of input are being handled correctly.
2. Ensure that the correct values are assigned to `newlines` and `before` based on the conditions described in the code and the function's objective.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if len(current_line.leaves) > 0:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed) if "\n" in first_leaf.prefix else 0
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    if current_line.depth >= len(self.previous_defs):
        self.previous_defs.append(0)  # assuming default value for stack
        
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if current_line.is_def and not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs[current_line.depth] = current_line.depth
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth == 0 else 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before if before > 0 else 1, 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before if before > 0 else 1, 0
    
    return before, 0
