The error message indicates a discrepancy between the expected and actual output. The expected output contains extra newline characters compared to the actual output. This suggests that the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is not handling the insertion of empty lines correctly.

Upon inspecting the function, it appears that the logic for inserting empty lines based on different conditions is not working as intended. The `before` variable, which determines the number of empty lines to be inserted before the current line, is being overwritten in multiple places within the function.

One of the reasons for the bug could be the incorrect handling of the `before` variable, which is intended to track the number of empty lines to be inserted before the current line. Additionally, the handling of different conditions and flags such as `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, and others needs to be reviewed to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is being returned.

To fix the bug, the logic for updating the `before` variable needs to be revised to accurately track the number of empty lines required based on different conditions. The handling of conditions such as decorators, definitions, classes, flow control, imports, and yields should be reviewed to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is inserted based on these conditions.

Here's the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

# Corrected function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    # Handle other conditions and return appropriate values
    return before, 0
```
