The error message states that the `assertFormatEqual` method encountered an `AssertionError` because the expected output does not match the actual output. The difference seems to occur due to the presence of extra newlines in the actual output.

Upon a closer look at the `def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]` function, it appears that there are conditions defined to handle the addition of empty lines based on certain criteria related to the `current_line`. 

The bug in the function is that it's not handling the insertion of empty lines correctly, leading to the unexpected behavior in the test case.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to review the logic for handling the insertion of empty lines in the function and ensure that it accurately assesses the conditions for adding or not adding empty lines.

Here's the corrected code for the `def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file or between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected code, the logic for handling empty lines has been adjusted to address the issues that were causing unexpected behavior. Additionally, the conditions for not inserting empty lines have been made more explicit to avoid unexpected empty line insertions.
