## Issue Analysis
The error message indicates that there are extra newlines present in the output that are not present in the expected output. This suggests that the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is incorrectly handling the line spacing, leading to extra newlines in the output.

## Probable Bug Location
The bug might be located in the logic that deals with the insertion of empty lines based on various conditions within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.

## Reason for the Bug
The logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to have conditions that are not properly handling the insertion of empty lines. This is leading to inconsistencies in the output.

## Suggested Approach
1. Review the conditions within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to ensure that they are correctly handling the insertion of empty lines based on different scenarios.
2. Consider refactoring the logic to make it more readable and easier to understand.
3. Test the function with different use cases to ensure that it behaves consistently.

## Corrected Code
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        if depth == 0:
            before = 2
        else:
            before = 1
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line

        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
