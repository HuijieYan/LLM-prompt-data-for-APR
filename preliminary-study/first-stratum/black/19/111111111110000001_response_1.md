The error occurs in the `assertFormatEqual` function. The `assertFormatEqual` function is part of the unit test, and it compares the expected output with the actual output. In this case, it seems that the actual output is not matching the expected output.

Upon analyzing the code, the potential error location within the problematic function is in the `_maybe_empty_lines` method of the `EmptyLineTracker` class. The bug might be causing unexpected behavior when handling decorators and comments within the code.

The reason behind this bug is that the `_maybe_empty_lines` method is not handling decorators and comments correctly, resulting in an incorrect number of empty lines in the output.

To fix this bug, the `_maybe_empty_lines` method needs to be updated to correctly handle decorators and comments. Additionally, it should ensure that the correct number of empty lines is inserted based on the context of the current code.

Here's the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` method:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import()
        and not current_line.is_import()
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield()
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected code, changes have been made to ensure that decorators, imports, and yields are handled correctly, and the appropriate number of empty lines are inserted based on the context of the current code.
