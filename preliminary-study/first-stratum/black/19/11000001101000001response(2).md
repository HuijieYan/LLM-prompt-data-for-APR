The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is likely related to the conditional statements not properly handling the different conditions. The function seems to be responsible for formatting code by adding empty lines in certain conditions.

The potential error can be related to the logic within the various conditional statements that determine when to add empty lines.

The problematic code seems to be trying to handle different cases where empty lines should be added based on the current line attributes and previous line attributes.

To fix the bug, the logic within the conditional statements needs to be carefully reviewed and adjusted to ensure that the correct conditions are being evaluated.

Here's the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
        
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0
        
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected code:
- The logic for evaluating conditions and adding empty lines has been revised to ensure that it accurately reflects the intended behavior.
- The conditions for adding empty lines before or after specific line types have been adjusted to match the expected behavior.

It's important to thoroughly test this code to ensure that it behaves as expected in a variety of scenarios.
