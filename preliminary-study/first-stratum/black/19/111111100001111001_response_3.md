The error is likely caused by the logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function not returning the expected results, leading to faulty functionality in the `EmptyLineTracker` class.

The issue stems from the conditional statements and their inability to return the expected number of newlines before or after the currently processed line. This behavior results in incorrect placement of empty lines within the code.

To rectify this issue, you should address the conditional statements that check for `current_line.is_decorator`, `current_line.is_def`, and `current_line.is_yield`. Additionally, consider the logic for updating `self.previous_defs`.

Here's a possible fix for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 2 if current_line.depth == 0 else 1

    # ... (omitted code in the function)

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_yield:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, `max_allowed` is initialized based on the `current_line.depth`. Furthermore, the logic for `current_line.is_decorator`, `current_line.is_def`, and `current_line.is_yield` has been revised to ensure `self.previous_defs` is appropriately updated, and the correct number of newlines is returned.
