The current function is meant to determine the number of empty lines to be added before a given line of code based on certain conditions. However, the function contains multiple conditional statements and does not handle all cases properly, leading to potential incorrect results.

Upon analysis of the buggy function and the provided test cases, it seems that the function has issues with handling multiple conditions for different types of lines (e.g. decorators, flow control, import statements, etc.) and their relationship with the depth of the current line. The handling of the `is_decorator` and `current_line.is_def` conditions seems to be particularly problematic.

To fix the bug, the conditional logic in the function needs to be revised to properly account for the different scenarios and types of lines. Additionally, the handling of depth-related conditions and the manipulation of the `before` variable also needs to be reviewed and adjusted.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if not self.previous_line:
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
``` 

The corrected code addresses the conditional logic and properly handles the different types of lines and their relationship with the depth of the current line. This should ensure that the function provides the expected results for the given test cases.
