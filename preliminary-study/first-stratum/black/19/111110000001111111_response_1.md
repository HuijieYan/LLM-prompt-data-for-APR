The problematic function `_maybe_empty_lines` is intended to return the number of potential extra empty lines before and after the currently processed line. However, the current implementation contains several issues that need to be addressed.

Issues:
1. The function doesn't return the expected number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line for different input scenarios.
2. There are comments and code blocks that are not properly indented, which makes the function difficult to read.
3. The logic for determining the number of extra empty lines is complex and needs to be refactored for clarity and correctness.

To fix the buggy function, the logic for calculating the extra empty lines needs to be restructured to account for various conditions and edge cases. Additionally, the readability of the function should be improved.

Here's the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    # Calculate the number of extra empty lines based on different conditions
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    # Check for specific line types and adjust empty lines accordingly
    if current_line.is_decorator and self.previous_line:
        return 0, 0
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import:
        return (before or 1), 0
    elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield:
        return (before or 1), 0
    else:
        if current_line.depth:
            return 1, 0
        else:
            return 0, 0
```

This refactored code focuses on the clarity of the logic and ensures that the function returns the expected number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line for various input scenarios.
