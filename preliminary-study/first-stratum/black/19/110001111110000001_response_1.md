The error message from the test function indicates that the output does not match the expected format. It seems to be related to the presence of empty lines and comments within decorators.

The potential error location is within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, particularly in the logic related to inserting empty lines.

The bug seems to occur because the function `_maybe_empty_lines` does not handle the insertion of empty lines correctly in certain cases, such as between decorators and after comments within decorators. This results in a mismatch between the expected and actual output.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to handle the insertion of empty lines more accurately.

Here's the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

# ... (other imports and code)

class SomeClass:
    # ... (other functions and methods)

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        
        if current_line.is_decorator:
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
        
        if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
            if not current_line.is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            return 2, 0
        
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return (before or 1), 0
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return (before or 1), 0
        
        return before, 0
```

In the corrected code, the logic for handling decorators, defs, and classes has been updated to ensure that empty lines are inserted correctly. The conditions for handling imports and yields have also been adjusted to address the issues identified in the original code.
