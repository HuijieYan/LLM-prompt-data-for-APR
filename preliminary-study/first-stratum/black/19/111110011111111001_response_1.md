The error occurs in the `assertFormatEqual()` method of the `BlackTestCase` class within the `test_comment_in_decorator` test case. The error message indicates that there is a mismatch between the expected output and the actual output of the `fs()` function.

Upon analyzing the error message, it seems that the issue is related to the presence of extra newlines in the actual output compared to the expected output.

The buggy code appears to be the `_maybe_empty_lines` method of the `EmptyLineTracker` class. This method is responsible for determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. Based on the provided test cases and input parameters, it seems that the method is not handling the cases of newlines correctly, leading to extra newlines being added where they are not expected.

To fix the bug, the `_maybe_empty_lines` method needs to be modified to properly handle the cases of newlines according to the logic provided. This may involve restructuring the conditional checks and update the logic for adding newlines.

Here's the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` method:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return 1, 0

    return 0, 0
```

In the corrected code, the logic for handling the cases of newlines is updated to match the expected behavior, based on the test cases and input parameters provided. This should resolve the issue of extra newlines in the actual output and align it with the expected output.

After making these changes, the `assertFormatEqual` method in the test case should no longer raise an AssertionError.
