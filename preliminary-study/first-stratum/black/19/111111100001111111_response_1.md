The issue with the function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to be related to how the logic handles the `current_line` object and the various conditions for the variables such as `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, etc. The function is supposed to return a tuple of integers representing the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.

Looking at the different test cases, it seems that the conditions for handling `is_decorator`, `is_def`, and `is_class` might not be properly evaluated based on the values of these attributes in the `current_line` object.

To address this issue, we need to ensure that the conditions for these attributes are correctly evaluated and the logic for calculating the number of empty lines based on these conditions is accurate.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    # Check conditions for is_decorator, is_def, is_class, and is_flow_control
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    else:
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return (before or 1), 0
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return (before or 1), 0
        return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, we made sure to correctly evaluate the conditions for `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, and `is_flow_control` and adjusted the logic accordingly to calculate the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.

These changes should address the issues identified in the different test cases and provide the expected behavior for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.
