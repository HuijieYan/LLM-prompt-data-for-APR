Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the logic that calculates the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line.

Reason behind the bug: The logic to calculate the number of empty lines appears to be convoluted and unclear, resulting in incorrect computations.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Simplify the logic for calculating the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line.
2. Ensure that the conditions for various types of lines (e.g., decorators, flow control, imports, etc.) are properly handled to determine the correct number of empty lines.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Tuple

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker:
    """
    Provides a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra
    empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
    
    Note: this tracker works on lines that haven't been split yet.  It assumes
    the prefix of the first leaf consists of optional newlines.  Those newlines
    are consumed by `maybe_empty_lines()` and included in the computation.
    """

            before = 1
