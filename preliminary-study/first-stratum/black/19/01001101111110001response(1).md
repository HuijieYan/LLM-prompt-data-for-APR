The test case `test_comment_in_decorator` is comparing the expected output with the actual output and failing with an `AssertionError`. The error message indicates that the newlines are not being handled correctly, resulting in the mismatch between expected and actual outputs.

The issue seems to be related to how the function `_maybe_empty_lines` handles newlines in the input `current_line`. It appears that there are discrepancies in the handling of newlines and indentation.

The function should appropriately handle conditions where newlines need to be added or removed before returning the final output.

To fix the bug:
1. Review the logic for adding and removing newlines based on different conditions.
2. Ensure that the function accounts for the presence of comments and decorators in the input `current_line`.
3. Verify that the logic for handling newlines is consistent and accurate.

Below is the corrected code for the `maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        current_line.leaves[0].prefix = ""
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth == 0 else 2
        
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and 
        not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and 
        (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected code, the handling of newlines, indentation, and different conditions has been revised to ensure consistent and accurate output. This should address the issues reported in the error message.
