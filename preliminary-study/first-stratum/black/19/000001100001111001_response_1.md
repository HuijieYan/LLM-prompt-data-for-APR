The issue with the _maybe_empty_lines function is that it does not return values with the correct types as specified in the function signature. Also, it doesn't have a return statement for all possible code paths.

The code has conditional statements that return different sets of values. 

To fix the function, we need to ensure that the return types match the function signature and that all possible code paths include a return statement.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

class Line:
    pass

class Leaf:
    pass

class EmptyLineTracker:
    # ... other methods ...

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return (0, 0)
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return (0, 0)
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
        return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, I have added return statements for all possible code paths and ensured that the return values are tuples with two integer elements, as specified in the function signature.
