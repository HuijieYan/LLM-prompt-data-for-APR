The error message indicates that the `assertFormatEqual` method is failing, comparing the expected output with the actual output. The error message suggests that the number of empty lines in the actual output does not match the expected output.

The potential error location within the `_maybe_empty_lines` method could be related to the logic that calculates the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line.

The bug seems to be occurring because the logic for calculating the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line is not working as intended. This is causing discrepancies between the expected output and the actual output.

To fix the bug, the logic for calculating the number of empty lines based on different conditions such as depth, decorators, flow control, imports, yields, and others should be reviewed and adjusted accordingly.

```python
# Corrected _maybe_empty_lines function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 1, 1
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return 1, 0
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return 1, 0
    
    return 0, 0
```

This corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function addresses the logic for calculating the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line under different conditions.
