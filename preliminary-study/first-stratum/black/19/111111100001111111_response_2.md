The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is having issues with the conditional `if` statements. The condition `if current_line.is_import` is causing problems because it references a method that doesn't exist in the class. The `is_import` method has been implemented as a function outside of the class, which is causing the problem.

To fix the bug:
1. Move the `is_import` method into the `EmptyLineTracker` class.
2. Update the method to take the `current_line` as a parameter.
3. Call the method as `self.is_import(current_line)` instead of `current_line.is_import` within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.

Here is the corrected code for the `is_import` method and the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    """
    Provides a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra
    empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
    
    Note: this tracker works on lines that haven't been split yet.  It assumes
    the prefix of the first leaf consists of optional newlines.  Those newlines
    are consumed by `maybe_empty_lines()` and included in the computation.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def is_import(self, current_line: Line) -> bool:
        # Implementation to determine if the current line is an import
        pass

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        # existing code
        is_import = self.is_import(current_line)  # Call the is_import method
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return before, 0
```

By moving and modifying the `is_import` method, the function should operate without errors.
