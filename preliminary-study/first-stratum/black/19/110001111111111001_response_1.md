The error comes from the fact that the `assertFormatEqual` function is comparing the expected and actual values for the `test_comment_in_decorator` test case and finding a mismatch. The `expected` and `actual` values are different, which causes the assertion error.

The potential error location in the `maybe_empty_lines` function is the logic for handling newlines in different conditions. It seems that the logic might not be correctly handling the insertion of empty lines in certain cases, leading to unexpected results.

The issue could be related to the incorrect handling of the conditions for inserting empty lines before or after certain elements in the code. The logic for determining whether to insert empty lines before or after specific lines might not be accurately capturing all cases, resulting in incorrect spacing in the output.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling the insertion of empty lines needs to be reviewed and possibly re-implemented to ensure that all relevant cases are considered and handled correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected code, the logic for handling the insertion of empty lines has been re-implemented to consider all relevant cases and ensure the correct spacing in the output.
