The error message indicates that the `assertFormatEqual` method of the `BlackTestCase` class is failing. This method is used to compare the expected and actual formatted code and check if they are equal.

The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is likely causing the formatting issue, as revealed by the mismatch between the expected and actual formatted code.

Looking at the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, the potential error could be related to how it handles the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. The logic for computing the number of empty lines is complex and could lead to incorrect results.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Simplify the logic for computing the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line to reduce the chances of errors.
2. Break down the function into smaller, more manageable parts to improve readability and maintainability.

Here's the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        return 0, 0
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 1, 1
    else:
        return 1, 0
```

This refactored version simplifies the logic by directly checking the type of the current line and returning the corresponding number of empty lines. This should reduce the chances of errors and make the function more manageable.
