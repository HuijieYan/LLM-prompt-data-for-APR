The error message indicates that the `assertFormatEqual` method is failing because the `expected` and `actual` outputs do not match. Specifically, there are extra empty lines in the actual output that are not present in the expected output.

Based on the information provided, the `buggy_function` seems to be adding more newlines than expected in certain cases. This could be due to the conditional logic for adding newlines not working as intended.

The potential error location within the function is in the logic that determines how many newlines to add before returning. The conditionals related to handling decorators, flow control, imports, and yields might not be correctly adjusting the number of newlines.

One approach to fixing the bug is to carefully review the conditional logic for adding newlines and ensure that it accurately reflects the expected behavior. Additionally, thorough testing with different input cases can help in identifying the specific conditions where the bug occurs.

Here's the corrected `maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.depth == 0 and current_line.is_decorator:
        return 0, 2

    if current_line.depth == 0 and current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, 1)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    if depth in self.previous_defs:
        self.previous_defs.remove(depth)
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected function takes into account the depth and the type of line (e.g., decorator, import, yield) to determine the correct number of newlines to add. It also handles the scenarios like decorators, imports, and yields more accurately. After implementing this correction, further testing is recommended to ensure that the function behaves as expected across different input cases.
