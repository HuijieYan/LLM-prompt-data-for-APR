The error message indicates that the expected and actual outputs of the `fs` function do not match. The error specifically mentions additional newline characters at certain places in the output, which suggests that the function `_maybe_empty_lines` is not handling newline characters properly.

Based on the error message and the debugging information, the potential error location within the problematic function `_maybe_empty_lines` is likely in the section where it computes the number of newlines to insert before and after the current line.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be due to incorrect handling of newlines when determining whether to insert newlines before or after the line. The logic for handling newlines and depth conditions might not be accurate, leading to incorrect insertion of newlines in the output.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling the computations of newlines before and after the current line needs to be reviewed and corrected. Proper conditions need to be applied to accurately determine the number of newlines to be inserted.

Here's the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` method:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth == 0 else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator and (
            self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator
        ):
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line:
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This improved code applies correct conditions for handling newlines and properly accounts for decorators, conditions, depths, and import statements.
