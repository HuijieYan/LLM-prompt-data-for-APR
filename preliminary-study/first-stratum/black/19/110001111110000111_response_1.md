The function `_maybe_empty_lines` is causing an error in the test `test_comment_in_decorator` because it is not handling the empty lines properly. The function is designed to manage the insertion of empty lines when formatting Python code, and it seems there are issues with its logic.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the section where it handles the decision to insert empty lines based on the current and previous line's properties. The calculation and comparison of empty lines and decorators, depth, imports, yield, flow control, etc., seems to be incorrect.

The bug occurred because the logic for determining when to insert empty lines was flawed. This led to incorrect insertion or skipping of empty lines, resulting in a formatting mismatch between the expected and actual outputs. 

To fix the bug, the logic for inserting empty lines based on different conditions needs to be revisited and adjusted. It's essential to correctly identify when to insert or skip empty lines based on the context of the lines being processed.

Here's the corrected and refactored code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

In the corrected code, the logic for managing empty lines has been simplified and adjusted to ensure proper handling of different line contexts. This should address the formatting mismatch and resolve the bug in the test case.
