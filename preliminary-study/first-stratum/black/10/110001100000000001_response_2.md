Potential Error:
The issue with the function is that it does not correctly handle the wait_for_nl condition. This results in incorrect prefix consumption and potentially incorrect results.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the wait_for_nl condition is not applied correctly. This condition is supposed to wait for a new line character before considering the current line as complete. However, the current implementation does not handle this condition properly.

Approach to Fix the Bug:
The fix involves properly handling the wait_for_nl condition and checking for the correct indentation level before considering the line as consumed. Additionally, we need to ensure that the remaining prefix is correctly returned.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                lines.append(current_line + char)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                break
        else:
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            break
        current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
```
