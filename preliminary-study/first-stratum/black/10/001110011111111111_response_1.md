The issue is related to the incorrect behavior of the `_partially_consume_prefix` method in the `Driver` class. The method is designed to consume a prefix of a string until a certain column, but it is not working as expected for some inputs, as evidenced by the failed test case `test_comment_indentation`.

The issue occurs because the method does not correctly handle the logic for consuming the prefix and updating the variables `lines`, `current_line`, `current_column`, and `wait_for_nl`. Additionally, the logic for checking the indentation level is incorrect, leading to incorrect behavior for tabulated comments after a dedent.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` method to correctly handle the consumption of the prefix and update the variables based on the input prefix string and the specified column. Additionally, we need to update the logic for handling tabulated comments and their indentation level.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` method:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line + char)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Assuming each tab counts as 4 spaces
            else:
                current_line += char

            if current_column >= column:  # Check if the current_column has reached the specified column
                break

        remaining_prefix = prefix[len(''.join(lines) + current_line):]
        return ''.join(lines), current_line + remaining_prefix
```

This corrected code should correctly handle the consumption of the prefix and update the variables `lines`, `current_line`, and `current_column` based on the input prefix string and the specified column. Additionally, it ensures that the logic for tabulated comments and their indentation level is handled correctly.
