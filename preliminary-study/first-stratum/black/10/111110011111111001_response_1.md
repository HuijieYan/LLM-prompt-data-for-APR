The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to handle indentation in a code prefix by consuming whitespace characters until a specific column is reached. It then returns the consumed prefix and the remaining unparsed prefix.

The errors in the function are causing issues with indentation in the test case `test_comment_indentation`. This is evidenced by the `AssertionError` thrown when comparing the expected and actual formatted strings.

The potential error location is within the logic that checks for indentation and waits for a newline character. The function may not be correctly handling the indentation and newline characters, resulting in incorrect parsing of the prefix.

The function is likely not correctly tracking the current indentation level and waiting for a newline character before returning the consumed prefix. Also, the handling of tab characters seems incorrect, which may lead to issues with indentation levels.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling indentation, including spaces, tabs, and newline characters, needs to be revised. Additionally, the function should correctly keep track of the current column to ensure proper parsing of the prefix.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            current_line += char
            if current_column >= column:
                lines.append(current_line)
                return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
        return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
```
