The test case is checking the indentation of comments in two different strings (`contents_spc` and `contents_tab`), and then using the `assertFormatEqual` function to compare the output of the buggy function `fs()` with the expected output `contents_spc`. The error message indicates that the expected output does not match the actual output for one of the test cases.

The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is likely causing the indentation issue, leading to the test failure.

The bug occurs because the `wait_for_nl` flag is not properly reset when a newline character is encountered. This causes the function to incorrectly handle indentation levels and newline characters.

To fix the bug, we should reset the `wait_for_nl` flag to `False` when a newline character is encountered so that the function can correctly handle the indentation and newline characters.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False  # reset the flag when encountering a newline character
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

With this correction, the function should now handle the indentation and newline characters correctly, and the test case should pass without error.
