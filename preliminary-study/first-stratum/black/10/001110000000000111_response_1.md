The bug in the provided function `_partially_consume_prefix` seems to be related to how it handles indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent. The function is meant to partially consume a prefix based on the specified column, but it seems to mishandle the indentation for tabulated comments.

Upon analyzing the function, it appears that the issue arises from the identification and handling of different types of characters (spaces, tabs, new lines) and the tracking of the current column. The function fails to correctly handle the indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent, leading to incorrect behavior.

To fix this bug, the function needs to correctly handle the indentation levels for tabulated comments after a dedent. This can be done by ensuring that the function properly tracks the indentation level and handles tabulated comments according to the specified column.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                continue  # Continue to the next character after handling the newline
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Adjust the column count by assuming tab width as 4
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Reset column count for new line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # Stop waiting for a newline if an indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected code, I've added a `continue` statement after handling the newline character to ensure that the function moves on to the next character. Additionally, I've adjusted the column count for tab characters to be equivalent to 4 spaces, as mentioned in the bug description.

These changes should address the incorrect handling of tabulated comments after a dedent and ensure that the function correctly consumes the prefix based on the specified column.
