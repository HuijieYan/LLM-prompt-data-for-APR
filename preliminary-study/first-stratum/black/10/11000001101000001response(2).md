The potential error in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the way the code handles indentation levels and waiting for a new line character. The function is intended to partially consume the prefix until a certain column level is reached, but it contains logic that is not correctly handling the indentation and new line characters.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is the incorrect handling of indentation levels and new line characters. The code is not properly resetting the `current_column` when a new line is encountered, and the logic for waiting for a new line is not functioning as intended.

To fix the bug, the code needs to accurately keep track of the current indentation level and correctly handle new line characters. Additionally, the logic for waiting for a new line needs to be adjusted to properly identify when a new line should reset the `current_column`.

Here is the corrected code for the `partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        if current_column >= column:
            return ''.join(lines), current_line
        if char != '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code ensures that the function properly handles indentation levels and new line characters, and correctly determines when to return the consumed prefix.
