The issue is related to the incorrect handling of indentation for comments after a dedent when the input file uses tabs. The provided function "_partially_consume_prefix" is likely causing this issue.

The reason for the bug is that the function is not correctly updating the current_column while iterating over the characters in the prefix. This results in incorrect indentation handling, especially when tabs are used.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly track and update the current_column based on the type of characters encountered (tab, space, newline) in the prefix. Additionally, the function should handle tab characters differently to accurately represent the indentation.

Here's the corrected function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == '\t':
                # Adjust column for tab based on the number of spaces
                current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected function now properly handles the update of current_column based on different character types and correctly adjusts the current_column for tab characters to accurately represent the indentation.
