Potential error location: The issue lies in the conditional logic for handling indentation and new lines within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The conditional logic is not correctly handling the indentation for comments after a dedent, especially when using tabs.

Suggested approach for fixing the bug: We need to modify the logic for handling indentation and new lines to properly preserve the indentation level of comments after a dedent.

Corrected code:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Adjusting indentation based on the number of spaces equivalent to a tab
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Reset the current_column to 0 for each new line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # Reset the current_column and wait for a new line when encountering a non-space or non-tab character
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
