Potential error location: The issue seems to be related to the handling of indentation when there are tabs in the input code, which leads to incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug is likely caused by the inconsistent handling of tabs and spaces when calculating the current column position in the code. This inconsistency results in incorrect positioning of the comments after a dedent.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

1. Ensure consistent handling of tabs and spaces when calculating the current column position.
2. Adjust the logic for indentation to properly account for tabs and spaces.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.rstrip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))  # adjust for tab width
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
