The error occurs because the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is not correctly handling the indentation for comments, especially when using tabs. This results in incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent.

The potential error lies in the `wait_for_nl` condition, where the logic for handling the indentation and new line characters is not correctly nested.

The reason for this bug is that the function is not properly tracking the current indentation level, especially when encountering new lines and different types of whitespace characters.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation level and adjusts it accordingly when encountering the different whitespace characters.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                else:  # if char is a non-whitespace character
                    wait_for_nl = False  # reset the wait_for_nl flag
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected code, we've adjusted the conditions and nesting to properly handle the indentation level based on different types of whitespace characters and new lines. This should resolve the bug related to incorrect comment indentation after a dedent.
