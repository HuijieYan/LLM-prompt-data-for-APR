Potential Error Location: The bug may be in the logic for handling the indentation of the prefix and waiting for a new line.

Reason for the Bug: The code does not properly handle the indentation and waiting for a new line in the prefix, causing incorrect consumption of the prefix.

Possible Approach to Fix the Bug: We need to properly handle the indentation, new lines, and waiting for a new line in the prefix to ensure correct consumption.

Corrected Code:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
