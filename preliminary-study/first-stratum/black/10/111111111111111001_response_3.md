The bug in the provided function `_partially_consume_prefix` appears to be in the logic to handle indentation in the input `prefix` string. The function is intended to consume a part of the prefix that has a specific column indentation.

The bug seems to be related to the logic used to handle different types of whitespace characters such as spaces and tabs and the count of `current_column`. This leads to incorrect identification of the line that needs to be partially consumed.

The bug occurs because the function incorrectly handles the indentation levels, leading to wrong decisions about when to stop consuming the prefix and return the consumed part.

To fix the bug, a possible approach would be to revise the logic for handling different types of whitespace characters so that it accurately tracks the column indentation and correctly identifies when to stop consuming the prefix.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            current_line += char
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code ensures that the indentation logic and column count are properly handled, which should address the bug and prevent the incorrect identification of the consumed prefix.
