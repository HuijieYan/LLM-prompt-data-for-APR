The error seems to be occurring in the `test_comment_indentation` method, specifically when trying to compare the formatted result for `contents_tab` with the expected `contents_spc`. This indicates that the `fs` function, which is responsible for formatting the input, is not producing the expected output for `contents_tab`.

The issue seems to be related to the incorrect handling of comments after a dedent when using tabs for indentation. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is likely responsible for this incorrect behavior.

The current implementation of `_partially_consume_prefix` seems to have issues with handling the indentation level and newline character when processing prefix strings with different indentation styles.

To fix this issue, we can modify the logic of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle different indentation styles and properly consume the prefix string.

The corrected function is provided below:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming each tab is equivalent to 4 spaces
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected code, the function processes each character in the prefix string, correctly updating the `current_column` based on spaces and tabs, and resetting it when encountering a newline character. The function also properly handles the `wait_for_nl` flag to determine when to process the next line.

These changes should address the bug related to incorrect comment indentation after a dedent when using tabs for indentation.
