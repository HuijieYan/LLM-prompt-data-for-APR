Potential error location: The issue seems to be related to the incorrect handling of indentation and tabs in the function `_partially_consume_prefix`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The function does not handle tabs (\t) correctly and does not account for the indentation level when processing the prefix.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the logic for handling tabs (\t) to correctly calculate the indentation level.
2. Adjust the logic to handle the indentation level and preserve the original formatting.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class Driver(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\t':
                # Calculate the number of spaces equivalent to the tab
                spaces_to_add = 4 - (current_column % 4)
                current_line += " " * spaces_to_add
                current_column += spaces_to_add
            else:
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1 if char != '\n' else -current_column
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
