The buggy function _partially_consume_prefix() has an issue where it is not correctly handling the case when the current line is empty and the next character is a newline. This causes it to incorrectly return the consumed prefix and the remaining prefix.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling the wait_for_nl flag and the condition for adding the current line to the lines list.

Here's the corrected code for the _partially_consume_prefix() function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected code, the logic for handling the wait_for_nl flag and adding the current line to the lines list has been adjusted to handle all edge cases. This should resolve the issue with the buggy function.
