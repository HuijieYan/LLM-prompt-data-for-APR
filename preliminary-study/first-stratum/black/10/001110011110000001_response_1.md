The error occurs when comparing the expected and actual outputs in the test case `test_comment_indentation`. The error message indicates that the `assertFormatEqual` method is failing because the expected and actual outputs do not match. The specific difference highlighted is the absence of a space before the comment in the actual output.

The potential error location within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is likely the conditional logic for handling indents and newlines. It seems that the function is not correctly handling the spaces and tabs at the beginning of each line, leading to incorrect output.

The bug occurs because the function does not properly consume the prefix while considering the column parameter.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling spaces, tabs, and newlines in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. We also need to ensure that it correctly considers the column parameter.

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            if current_column < column:
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1
            else:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
        elif char == '\t':
            if current_column < column:
                if (column - current_column) >= 4:
                    current_line += "    "  # Replace tab with spaces
                    current_column += 4
                else:
                    current_line += " " * (column - current_column)  # Fill remaining spaces
                    current_column = column
            else:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected function now properly handles spaces, tabs, and newlines while considering the column parameter.
