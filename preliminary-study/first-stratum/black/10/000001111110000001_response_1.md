The test function `test_comment_indentation` is trying to compare the formatted output of `contents_tab` and `contents_spc`. It is using the `assertFormatEqual` method to compare the expected and actual formatted outputs. However, it is failing for certain inputs, as indicated by the error message, due to differences in indentation and comments.

The potential error location within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is in the logic related to handling comments and indentation.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling comments and their indentation. This causes discrepancies in the formatted output, leading to the assertion failures in the test function.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to revise the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to properly handle comments and their indentation, ensuring that the expected and actual outputs match.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming 4 spaces for each indentation level
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming 4 spaces for each indentation level
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            wait_for_nl = True  # Wait for newline after the comment
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
