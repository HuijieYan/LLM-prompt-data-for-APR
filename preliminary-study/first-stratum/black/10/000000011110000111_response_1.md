Potential error location: 

The issue seems to be related to the handling of tab characters and the incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent.

Reason for the bug:

The bug seems to be related to the way the function is handling tab characters and their indentation level relative to spaces. This causes the comments to be incorrectly indented after a dedent.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

1. Modify the logic for handling tab characters to ensure that their indentation level is correctly accounted for.
2. Update the handling of comments to ensure that they maintain the correct indentation level after a dedent.

Corrected code:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming each tab is equivalent to 4 spaces
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
