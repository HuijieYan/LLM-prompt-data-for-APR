The issue seems to be with the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, which is used to handle indentation in comments. It seems that the function is not handling the indentation levels correctly, especially when a comment is encountered after a dedent.

The code is not properly tracking the current indentation level and handling the comments within the indentation level. This results in incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly track the current indentation level and handle comments within that level. It should also correctly handle the case where a comment is encountered after a dedent.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The changes made to the code include:
1. Adjusting the check for column comparisons to include less than or equal to instead of just less than.
2. Fixing the handling of tabs to correctly calculate the indentation level.
3. Setting `wait_for_nl` to `False` when encountering a newline character, to handle unexpected empty lines properly.

By making these changes, the function should correctly handle the indentation of comments and address the issue reported in the test case.
