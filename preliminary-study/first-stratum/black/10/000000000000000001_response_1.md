Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the `wait_for_nl` block, where the function is checking for a newline character.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug is likely due to the logic in the `wait_for_nl` block, which is not properly handling the newline character and resetting the `current_column` and `current_line` values.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: The `wait_for_nl` block needs to be revised to properly handle the newline character and reset the `current_column` and `current_line` values. Additionally, the logic for tracking the column count needs to be reviewed for accuracy.

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_column += 1
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
