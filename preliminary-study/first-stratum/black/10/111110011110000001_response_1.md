The `test_comment_indentation` test case is comparing the expected output `contents_spc` with the actual output from the `fs` function. It seems that the `fs` function is expected to format the input string to a particular format and the test checks whether the output matches the expected format.

The potential error in the `Driver` class's `_partially_consume_prefix` method is around the handling of newline characters. It seems that the function is not correctly handling the indentation caused by the presence of tab characters or spaces.

The reason behind the bug could be due to the incorrect handling of the indentation level when encountering tab or space characters as well as when encountering newline characters. The indentation level is not being updated correctly based on the encountered characters.

To fix the bug, the function needs to accurately track the indentation level and whether it is being maintained or reset when encountering different characters such as tab, space, or newline.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` method:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # Handle newline characters properly
                if current_column > 0:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    # If the current column is 0, it is an empty line
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    lines.append("\n")
                    current_line = ""
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
In the corrected code, when encountering newline characters, the function checks if the current column is greater than 0. If it is, it appends the current line to the list of lines and resets the current line and column. If the column is 0, it indicates an empty line, and it appends it to the list of lines. This should resolve the issue with incorrect formatting and handle indentation and newline characters properly.
