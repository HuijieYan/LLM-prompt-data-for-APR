The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is due to incorrect tracking of the current column position and handling of indentation levels. The `wait_for_nl` variable is not being properly reset after encountering a new line, leading to incorrect indentation. Additionally, the logic for calculating the current column position is flawed, which causes incorrect handling of tabs and spaces.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly reset the `wait_for_nl` variable after encountering a new line and fix the logic for calculating the current column position.

Here is the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False  # Reset wait_for_nl after encountering a new line
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Adjust for tab width
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False  # Reset wait_for_nl after encountering a new line
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these corrections, the function should now properly handle the indentation and comments according to the provided test cases.
