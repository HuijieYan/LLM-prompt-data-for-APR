The bug seems to be related to the indentation of comments in the code. The `assertFormatEqual` function is comparing the expected and actual output, and it seems that the buggy function is not handling the indentation of comments correctly.

Potential error location: The `_partially_consume_prefix` function, particularly in the logic related to handling indentation.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug might be occurring due to the incorrect handling of spaces and tabs, which is impacting the indentation of comments in the code.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Review the logic for handling spaces and tabs within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to ensure the correct calculation of indentation.
2. Ensure that the function correctly identifies the indentation level of comments and maintains it in the output.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_column += 1 if char == ' ' else 4 if char == '\t' else 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
