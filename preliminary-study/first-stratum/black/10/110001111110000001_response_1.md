The error seems to be related to the indentation level being incorrect when comparing the two outputs. This suggests that the `partially_consume_prefix` function is not properly handling the indentation.

The potential error location in the `partially_consume_prefix` function is the logic related to handling spaces and tabs.

The reason for the bug is that the function is not accurately tracking the column and indentation levels while processing the input prefix string. This causes the function to incorrectly consume the prefix and calculate the indentation.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly handle spaces, tabs, and newline characters to accurately track the column and indentation levels.

Here's the corrected code for the `partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_column = 0
            current_line = ""
            continue
        else:
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0

        current_line += char

        if current_column >= column and char != ' ' and char != '\t':
            break
    
    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

With the updated logic, the `partially_consume_prefix` function should accurately consume the prefix and calculate the correct indentation levels. Testing with the provided test cases should demonstrate the proper functioning of the updated function.
