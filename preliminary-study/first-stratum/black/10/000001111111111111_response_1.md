The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has a few issues that need to be fixed. The main problem seems to be that the function is not correctly handling the indentation of comments after a dedent.

Looking at the test case `test_comment_indentation`, it seems that the function is failing to correctly handle the indentation of comments in some cases. The error message also indicates a problem with the indentation of comments not being preserved after a dedent.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the logic related to handling indentation and newline characters.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not correctly tracking the indentation level and handling comments after a dedent.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly identify when a comment should be indented and make sure it preserves the correct indentation level.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == "\n":
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = "".join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == " " or char == "\t":
            current_column += 1 if char == " " else 4
        elif char == "\n":
            current_column = 0
            if current_line.strip().startswith("# "):
                wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = False
    return "".join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected code, I've added a condition to check if the current line is a comment (startswith `#`) and set `wait_for_nl` to `True`. This ensures that the function waits for a newline after the comment for correct indentation.

With this fix, the function should now correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent.
