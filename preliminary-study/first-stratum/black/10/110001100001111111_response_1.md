The issue lies within the logic of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, specifically in the condition for handling tabs (`\t`) and spaces (`' '`) as indentation.

The bug occurs because when the function encounters a tab character in the input string, it incorrectly increments the `current_column` variable by `4` instead of `1`. This causes the subsequent lines to be incorrectly indented.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic for handling tab characters to correctly increment the `current_column` variable by `1` instead of `4`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 1  # Fix: Increment current_column by 1 for tab character
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now handle tab characters correctly and produce the expected indentation for comments after a dedent.
