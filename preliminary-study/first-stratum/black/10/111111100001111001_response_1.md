The bug is in the `_partially_consume_prefix` method, which is supposed to partially consume a prefix string based on a given column value but has an erroneous logic leading to incorrect output.

The function `_partially_consume_prefix` has an issue with the logic related to updating the `current_column` value when the `wait_for_nl` flag is set. The `wait_for_nl` flag is being set to `True` and never reset to `False` when a new line character is encountered. This causes the function to incorrectly process the prefix string and compute the `current_column` value.

To fix this bug, the logic for resetting the `wait_for_nl` flag and updating the `current_column` value when encountering a new line character should be revised.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` method:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_line += char
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
