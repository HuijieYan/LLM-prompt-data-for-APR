Analysis:
1. The test function is comparing the expected output with the actual output using the assertFormatEqual function.
2. The error message indicates that the expected and actual outputs are not equal, specifically for the indentation of comments after a dedent.
3. The bug is likely to be in the _partially_consume_prefix function, where the calculation of indentation may not be handling the tab characters correctly.
4. The bug occurs because the function does not handle tab characters (\t) properly when calculating the column position. Tab characters are considered as a single space in the current implementation, which leads to incorrect indentation calculation.
5. The fix involves updating the way tab characters are handled for column calculations in the _partially_consume_prefix function.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            spaces_to_next_tab = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_line += ' ' * spaces_to_next_tab
            current_column += spaces_to_next_tab
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

This corrected function properly handles tab characters and calculates the column position correctly, ensuring that the indentation is preserved as expected.
