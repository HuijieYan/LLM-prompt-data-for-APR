The error seems to be related to the indentation of comments after a dedent, particularly when the input file uses tabs. The test case `test_comment_indentation` is checking the equality of two strings: `contents_tab` and `contents_spc`. The error message indicates that there is an AssertionError when comparing the expected and actual strings.

The potential error location within the `Driver` class is the `_partially_consume_prefix` method. The method seems to be intended to consume a prefix of a string until a certain column is reached, and return the consumed prefix and the remaining string. However, it fails to handle the indentation of comments correctly, particularly in cases where the input file uses tabs for indentation.

The bug occurs because the method does not handle the correct indentation level for comments after a dedent, especially when the input file uses tabs. As a result, the indentation of comments is incorrectly changed.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_partially_consume_prefix` method to correctly handle the indentation of comments, especially when using tabs for indentation. This may involve tracking the indentation level and adjusting the behavior of the method accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` method:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Adjust the column count based on the tab size (e.g., 4 spaces)
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Reset the column count at the start of a new line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # Check for the start of a comment and adjust the column count accordingly
            if current_line.lstrip().startswith('#'):
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # Adjust the column count based on the character type
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected code, we have added a condition to check for the start of a comment and reset the column count accordingly. This should help to handle the indentation of comments correctly, especially when using tabs for indentation.
