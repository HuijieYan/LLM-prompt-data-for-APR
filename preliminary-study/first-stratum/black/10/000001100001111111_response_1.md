The issue seems to be related to the handling of indentation in the comments. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not correctly handling the indentation for comments after a dedent. This is causing incorrect indentation for tabulated comments.

The potential error seems to be in the logic for adding the lines to the `lines` list and handling the indentation and new lines.

The buggy function does not handle the indentation and new lines correctly when building the `lines` list. It fails to maintain the correct indentation level and does not take into account the impact of new lines on the indentation.

To fix the bug, the function `_partially_consume_prefix` needs to be rewritten to correctly handle the indentation and new lines when building the `lines` list. It should also properly maintain the current column and handle the wait for new line condition.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip():
                lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            current_line += char

    if current_line.strip():
        lines.append(current_line)

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code should address the issues with incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
