The bug occurs because the `wait_for_nl` flag is not being set back to false after a new line character is encountered. This prevents the code from fully resetting after a new line is found.

To fix the bug, we'll reset the `wait_for_nl` flag to False once a new line character is encountered. 

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class Driver(object):
    # ... omitted code ...


    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False  # reset the flag
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_line = ""  # reset the line
                current_column = 0  # reset the column
                wait_for_nl = False  # reset the flag
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
