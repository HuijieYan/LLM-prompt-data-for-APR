The bug occurs because the function is not correctly handling cases where the column limit is reached before encountering a newline character. 

The function is supposed to split the input `prefix` string based on the `column` value. However, in the current implementation, it only checks for the newline character when it reaches the column limit. This leads to incorrect results when the column limit is reached before encountering a newline character.

To fix the bug, the function should also check for the column limit when there is no newline character in the `prefix` string.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if current_column >= column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
