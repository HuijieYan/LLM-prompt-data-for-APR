The error seems to be related to the manipulation of indentation in the original code. The test case is checking if the indentation for comments is correctly handled for both tab and space indentations. The error message indicates that for tab indentation, the comment indentation is not being handled correctly after a dedent.

The potential error location within the code is the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, specifically in the part where it handles the indentation of the comments.

The bug occurs because the function is not correctly handling the scenario of a comment being indented relative to the line it follows. This leads to incorrect indentation when the comment is at a deeper level than the following line.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling comments and their indentation. We should ensure that comments are correctly aligned with the same level of indentation as the following line.

Below is the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if current_line.strip() and current_column < column and not char.isspace():
            res = ''.join(lines)
            return res, prefix[len(res):]

        if char == '\n':
            res = ''.join(lines)
            return res, prefix[len(res):]
        
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4

        lines.append(current_line)
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected code, we iterate over the characters in the input prefix and build lines with their respective indentation levels. We then compare the indentation level of the comment with the following line and adjust the indentation accordingly.

This correction should ensure that the comments are correctly aligned with the same level of indentation as the following line, resolving the bug.
