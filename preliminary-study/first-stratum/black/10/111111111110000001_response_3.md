The error message is indicating that the output of the `fs` function is not as expected. This is likely related to the `_partially_consume_prefix` function since it is the one being called by the `fs` function.

Upon analyzing the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, the issue seems to be with the conditional logic for handling indentation. The bug occurs because the `wait_for_nl` flag is not properly initiated and handled. This causes incorrect handling of the newline characters '\n' and ultimately results in incorrect output.

To fix the bug:
1. Initialize the `wait_for_nl` flag to True at the beginning of the function.
2. Adjust the conditional logic to properly handle the 'wait_for_nl' flag and newline characters.
3. Update the logic for building the lines list.

Here is the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = True  # initialize the flag to True
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True  # reset the flag after handling newline
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True  # set the flag after handling newline
        else:
            wait_for_nl = False  # unset the flag if not waiting for newline
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these corrections, the logic for handling indentations, newlines, and building the lines list should work correctly and provide the expected output for the test case.
