The potential error in the provided function is in the logic for handling indentation and new lines. It seems that the function is not correctly handling the indentation and it is also not returning the expected result.

The bug occurs because the current implementation does not properly handle the indentation and new lines. It also does not concatenate the lines correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to re-implement the logic for handling indentation and new lines, as well as the logic for concatenating the lines.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected implementation properly handles the indentation and new lines and should return the expected result for the given test cases.
