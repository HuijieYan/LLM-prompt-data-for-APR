The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the logic for identifying when to return the result `res` and the remaining prefix.

The bug occurs because the logic for identifying when to return the result `res` and the remaining prefix is incorrect. The expected behavior is to return the result `res` when the current line has been fully consumed, and the remaining prefix after the current line. However, the current logic uses a flag `wait_for_nl` to attempt to determine when to return the result, but it does not cover all cases correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for identifying when to return the result `res` and the remaining prefix to cover all cases correctly with the correct conditions and handling of the `wait_for_nl` flag.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl and char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            current_column = 0
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected code, the function should be able to correctly handle the prefix and column values and return the expected results.
