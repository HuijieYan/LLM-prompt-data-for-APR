The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix string and return the consumed part as well as the remaining part, based on a given column. However, the function is not handling the indentation correctly, especially when encountering a tab character.

The error message from the test function `test_comment_indentation` is indicating an incorrect indentation for the comment after a dedent. This suggests that the function is not correctly handling the indentation, especially when dealing with tabs.

The issue occurs because the function does not properly account for tab characters when calculating the current column. This leads to incorrect handling of indentation, especially when transitioning between spaces and tabs.

To fix the bug, the function needs to accurately calculate the column taking into account both spaces and tab characters. It should handle the indentation appropriately to ensure the correct consumption of the prefix based on the given column.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            spaces_to_add = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_column += spaces_to_add
            current_line += ' ' * spaces_to_add
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
