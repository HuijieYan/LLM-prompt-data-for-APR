The potential error in the provided function is in the logic for handling tabs and spaces. It seems that the function is trying to consume a prefix string by partially considering the indentation. However, it is not handling tabs and spaces correctly, which is causing it to fail in some scenarios, as shown in the test cases.

The reason behind the bug is that the function is not correctly calculating the column position when encountering tabs and spaces, and it is not handling the indentation correctly while consuming the prefix string.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the tab and space characters to calculate the column position accurately. Additionally, it should properly handle the indentation while consuming the prefix string.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':  # consider each space as a single column
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':  # consider each tab as 4 columns
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:  # other characters
            current_line += char
            if not wait_for_nl:  # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected function should properly handle both tabs and spaces, and correctly consume the prefix string based on the given column position.
