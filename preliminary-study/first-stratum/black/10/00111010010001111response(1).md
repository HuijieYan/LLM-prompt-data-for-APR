The buggy function _partially_consume_prefix is having issues with correctly handling the indentation of comments. The function is supposed to check for lines with fewer spaces than the column parameter and then return the lines. However, it fails to handle the indentation of comments properly, especially in cases where tabs are used for indentation.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function does not properly differentiate between tab and space characters when calculating the current column. This leads to incorrect handling of indentation, especially when dealing with comments.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly calculates the current column by differentiating between tab and space characters. Additionally, the function should properly handle the indentation of comments, ensuring that they are correctly aligned based on the indentation level.

```python
# class declaration containing the fixed function
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                # check for consecutive spaces
                if prefix[prefix.index(char)-1] != ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                else:
                    current_column += 4
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the logic for handling space characters and tabs, as well as ensuring proper handling of comment indentation, the corrected function should now behave as expected and correctly handle the indentation of comments, irrespective of whether tabs or spaces are used for indentation.
