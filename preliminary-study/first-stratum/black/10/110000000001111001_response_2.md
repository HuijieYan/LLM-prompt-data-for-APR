Potential Error Location:
The bug likely occurs in the logic related to updating the current line and column position in the '_partially_consume_prefix' function.

Reasons behind the Bug:
1. The logic for updating the 'current_column' when encountering whitespaces or tabs is not correctly implemented, resulting in incorrect tracking of the column position.
2. The 'wait_for_nl' flag is not appropriately handled for certain conditions as it should reset after encountering a newline character.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Adjust the logic for updating 'current_column' when encountering whitespaces or tabs to correctly reflect the column position.
2. Update the handling of the 'wait_for_nl' flag to reset it after encountering a newline character.

Corrected Code:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)  # Adjust column position for tabs
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False  # Reset wait_for_nl flag
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
