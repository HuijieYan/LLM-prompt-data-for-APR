The bug occurs in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` in the if condition where `wait_for_nl` is True. This condition is not properly handling the case where the current column is less than the specified column. As a result, the indentation of comments is not processed correctly after dedent.

This bug occurs because the function does not properly handle the indentation level of comments, especially after dedent. When the function encounters a newline character and `wait_for_nl` is True, it should check if the current column is less than the specified column. If so, it should adjust the indentation level of the comment accordingly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the if condition where `wait_for_nl` is True to correctly handle the indentation level of the comment after dedent. We can check if the current column is less than the specified column and adjust the code accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                if current_column < column:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                else:
                    lines.append(" " * (current_column - column) + current_line.strip())

                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
