The bug occurs in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, specifically in the logic for handling tab characters. When a tab character is encountered, the `current_column` is incremented by 4, which is incorrect. Tabs should be treated as 1 character, not 4. This leads to incorrect indentation calculation, especially for tabulated comments after a dedent.

To fix this bug, the logic for handling tab characters needs to be corrected. Instead of incrementing `current_column` by 4 for each tab, it should be incremented by 1.

Here is the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Increment current_column by 1 for each tab
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the tab characters are now correctly handled, and the indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent will be calculated accurately.
