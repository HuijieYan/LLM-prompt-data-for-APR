The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume the prefix string until a certain column limit is reached, and return the consumed part along with the remaining part of the prefix. However, the function has a bug related to handling indentation and newline characters, causing incorrect behavior for tabulated comments after a dedent.

The bug occurs because the `wait_for_nl` flag is not properly handled. When encountering a newline character, the current column is reset to 0 regardless of the indentation level, which leads to incorrect behavior for tabulated comments after a dedent.

To fix the bug, the function should properly handle the `wait_for_nl` flag and reset the current column based on the actual indentation level.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                # Reset current_column to the actual indentation level
                current_column = len(current_line) - len(current_line.lstrip())
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming 4 spaces for each tab, adjust as needed
        elif char == '\n':
            # Reset current_column to the actual indentation level
            current_column = len(current_line) - len(current_line.lstrip())
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

With this correction, the function should now properly consume the prefix string based on the given column limit and handle the indentation, including tabulated comments after a dedent.
