The given function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix string up to a specified column and return the consumed part and the remaining part. However, there are issues with its current implementation.

The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of the `wait_for_nl` condition. When a '\n' character is encountered, the function is not properly updating the `wait_for_nl` flag and handling the computation of current column and line. This results in incorrect behavior and causes the function to return incorrect output.

To fix this bug, we need to update the handling of the `wait_for_nl` condition and properly compute the current column and line.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 4
        else:
            if current_column < column:
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1
            else:
                break
    return current_line, prefix[len(current_line):]
```
