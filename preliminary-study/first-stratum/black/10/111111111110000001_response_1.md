The error occurs in the `test_comment_indentation` function at line 517 of the `test_black.py` file. The error message indicates that the expected output does not match the actual output, specifically related to the indentation after the comment.

The potential error location within the `Driver` class is the `_partially_consume_prefix` method. This method is responsible for partially consuming a prefix string based on specific indentation rules, and it seems like the logic is not handling the indentation and newline characters properly, which results in incorrect output.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the logic inside the `_partially_consume_prefix` method is not correctly handling the indentation, new lines, and spaces, leading to incorrect prefix consumption.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of the `_partially_consume_prefix` method to properly handle the indentation, new lines, and spaces while consuming the prefix string.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` method:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl or char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_line += char
        else:
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected code, the logic properly handles the consumption of the prefix string based on the indentation and new line characters, which should resolve the bug.
