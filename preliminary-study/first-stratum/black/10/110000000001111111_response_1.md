The issue seems to be with the handling of tabs and spaces in the input string. The current function assumes a tab is equivalent to 4 spaces, which might not be the case and is causing incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.

Based on the analysis of the function and the provided test cases, the bug is occurring in the handling of tabs and spaces to calculate the current column position.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic for handling tab characters. We should consider each tab as equivalent to the next multiple of 4 and adjust the current_column accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # adjust current_column for tabs
        else:
            current_column += 1
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    wait_for_nl = False
                elif char == ' ':
                    current_line += char
                    continue
        current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code includes additional logic to properly handle tabs, adjusting the current_column position as needed. This should resolve the issue of incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
