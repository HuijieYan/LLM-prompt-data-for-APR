The error occurs when the input file uses tabs and the indentation for comments past depth 0 is changed incorrectly after a dedent. This is likely due to the _partially_consume_prefix function not correctly handling the indentation for comments.

To fix this bug, the function _partially_consume_prefix needs to be modified to correctly handle the indentation for comments when using tabs.

Here is the corrected code for the _partially_consume_prefix function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.lstrip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.lstrip().startswith("#"):
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the modified code, we have added a check to see if the current line starts with a '#' (indicating a comment). If it does, we reset the current column to 0. This will ensure that the comments are correctly indented, especially after a dedent.

This should fix the bug and correctly handle the indentation for comments, even when using tabs.
