The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be in the logic for checking the column width. This bug is relevant to the test case `test_comment_indentation` and the error message from the test function indicates a mismatch in the expected and actual output.

The logic for counting the column width is flawed and doesn't handle the indentation correctly, which results in incorrect output.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly count the column width while iterating through the prefix string and handle the indentation properly.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)  # adjust column for tab width
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected code, the column width is adjusted for tab characters, and the logic for counting the column width is updated to handle both spaces and tabs correctly. This should fix the bug and make the function produce the expected output.
