Potential error location: The bug appears to be in the logic for handling indentation and new lines within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function.

Reasons behind the bug:
1. When the function encounters a newline character ('\n'), it resets the `current_column` to 0, which could potentially ignore the previous indentation levels and cause incorrect output.
2. The logic for checking if the current line is empty and the column is less than the specified column is not handling the situation correctly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Adjust the logic for handling indentation and new lines to correctly track and maintain the indentation levels.
2. Properly check for empty lines and the column value to consume the prefix up to the specified column.


Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected code:
1. The logic for handling whitespace and indentation has been adjusted to accurately track the current column and consume the prefix up to the specified column.
2. Proper checks for new lines and indentation have been implemented to ensure correct behavior.
