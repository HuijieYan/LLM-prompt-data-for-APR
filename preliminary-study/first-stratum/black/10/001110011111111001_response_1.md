The test cases are checking the indentation of comments in a given code and expecting the output to be properly formatted. The error message indicates that the result is not matching the expected output for the test case. 

The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic for handling indentation and new lines in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function.

The bug occurs because the logic inside the `for` loop within the function does not properly handle the indentation and new line characters. This causes inconsistencies in the formatting of the comments, leading to the test failures.

To fix the bug, we should properly handle the indentation and new line characters within the `for` loop. We need to accurately track and update the current column and line based on the characters encountered, and correctly account for the indentation changes and new lines.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected code, the function now properly handles the indentation and new line characters, ensuring that the formatting of comments is consistent and aligns with the expected output for the test cases.
