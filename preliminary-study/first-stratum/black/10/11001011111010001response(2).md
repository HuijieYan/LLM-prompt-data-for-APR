The bug in the `partially_consume_prefix` function is in the logic for handling whitespace and tab characters. The function is intended to consume a specified prefix up to a given column, splitting it into "lines" and "current_line". 

However, the bug causes incorrect handling of both tab characters and the column tracking when handling indentation. It leads to incorrect behavior when the input prefix contains tabs, and it doesn't handle the indentation properly, leading to the wrong result.

To fix the bug:
1. We need to correctly handle the tab characters ('\t') to properly count the column position.
2. We need to keep track of the whitespace and tab characters and increment the column appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the `partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
            continue
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        if wait_for_nl:
            if current_column >= column and current_line.strip():
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ' or char == '\t':
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected code, the function should now properly handle the indentation, consuming the prefix up to the specified column correctly.
