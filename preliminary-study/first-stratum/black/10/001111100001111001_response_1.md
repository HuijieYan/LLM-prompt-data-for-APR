The buggy function is designed to partially consume a given input prefix up to a specified column index. However, it fails to correctly identify and process newline characters, tabs, and spaces according to the specified column index. 

The issue in the function arises from the incorrect handling of indentation (tabs and spaces) and newline characters. 

To resolve this issue, we need to modify the conditional checks and state transitions to accurately track the prefix and consume it based on the specified column index.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Considering 4 spaces for each tab
            current_line += char
        else:
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
            
        if current_column >= column:
            break

    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```
