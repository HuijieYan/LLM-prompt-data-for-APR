The error seems to be related to the indentation of comments after a dedent, especially when the input file uses tabs. This results in incorrect indentation of the comments after a dedent. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is the likely source of the bug as it deals with handling prefixes and columns in the code.

The issue appears to be with how the function handles the indentation and whitespace characters, especially when encountering newlines, spaces, and tabs.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function accurately tracks the current column and correctly identifies the start of a new line when encountering whitespace characters, tabs, and newlines. It should also correctly handle the indentation level for comments after a dedent.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        current_line += char

    res = ''.join(lines)
    if len(res) < len(prefix) and res[-1] == '\n':
        res = res[:-1]
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

This corrected code should address the issues with handling the comment indentation after a dedent, especially when using tabs. The function now correctly tracks the current column and handles whitespace characters, tabs, and newlines to ensure correct indentation of comments after a dedent.
