The error occurs due to the incorrect implementation of the _partially_consume_prefix function. This function is supposed to partially consume the prefix up to a certain column. The bug is causing the function to return incorrect results, leading to the test failure.

The potential location of the error is within the condition when 'wait_for_nl' is True. The current implementation fails to correctly handle the case where a newline character ('\n') is encountered.

The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle the newline character ('\n') when 'wait_for_nl' is True. As a result, the function fails to correctly consume the prefix up to the specified column, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the case when a newline character is encountered while 'wait_for_nl' is True. Also, the logic for managing the current line and line consumption needs to be adjusted.

Below is the corrected code for the _partially_consume_prefix function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = [""]
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    if char == '\n':
                        current_column = 0
                    lines.append("")
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            lines[-1] += char
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:  # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
```

The corrected function now properly handles the cases when a newline character is encountered while 'wait_for_nl' is True, and it correctly consumes the prefix up to the specified column.
