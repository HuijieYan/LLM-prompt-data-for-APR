Potential error:
In the function `_partially_consume_prefix`, there is an issue with the logic of handling the newline character.

Reason for the bug:
The `wait_for_nl` variable is not being updated correctly. As a result, the function fails to correctly consume the prefix string and identify the appropriate line breaks and indentation.

Approach to fixing the bug:
1. A conditional statement should be added to update the `wait_for_nl` variable appropriately when encountering a newline character.
2. The logic for handling the indentation and spaces should be adjusted.

Corrected code:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            wait_for_nl = True  # Updated to set wait_for_nl to True
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = False  # Updated to set wait_for_nl to False
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
