Potential Error Location:
The issue appears to be in the `if` condition for checking if the character is a space or a tab. It is incrementing the `current_column` variable by 1 or 4, but it should be checking if the `current_column + 1` or `current_column + 4` is less than the given `column` value.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function is not properly handling the case where the current column value exceeds the given column value.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the current column plus the added value (1 or 4 for space or tab, respectively) exceeds the given column value before incrementing the current column variable.
2. Reset the `current_column` to 0 when encountering a new line character to accurately track column positions.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            if current_column + 1 < column:
                current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            if current_column + 4 < column:
                current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
