The bug is located in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. The bug seems to be caused by the code not handling the indentation correctly when consuming the prefix.

The error message from the test function indicates that the expected and actual outputs differ when the `assertFormatEqual` function is called.

One potential cause of the bug is that the logic for handling whitespace and new lines is not correctly consuming the prefix. The function is intended to partially consume the prefix up to a certain column, but it seems to be incorrectly detecting new lines and not handling whitespace and indentation properly.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for consuming the prefix to properly handle whitespace, new lines, and indentation. A more robust approach would be to iterate through the prefix character by character, keeping track of the current column and adding characters to the lines as necessary.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0

    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char

        if current_column >= column and char != '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected logic, the function should now handle whitespace, new lines, and indentation correctly, and the test case should produce the expected output without errors.
