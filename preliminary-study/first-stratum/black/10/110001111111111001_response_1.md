Potential error location: The bug seems to be located in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function that is supposed to partially consume the prefix according to the specified column.

Reason for the bug: The bug might be occurring because the logic for consuming the prefix based on the specified column is not implemented correctly. The function is not handling the indentation properly, which results in incorrect consumption of the prefix.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. We can modify the logic for consuming the prefix by considering the indentation level and the specified column.
2. We can track the current indentation level and consume the prefix accordingly until the specified column is reached.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
