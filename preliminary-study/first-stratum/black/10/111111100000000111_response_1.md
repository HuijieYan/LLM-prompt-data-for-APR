The issue seems to be related to the incorrect handling of indentation for comments after a dedent when the input file uses tabs. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is likely causing this issue.

Upon analyzing the function, it seems that the issue may be caused by the incorrect handling of tab characters. The function is intended to partially consume a prefix string while considering column and line breaks. However, the handling of tab characters (`\t`) may be causing the incorrect calculation of the current column, leading to incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent.

To fix this issue, we can modify the handling of tab characters to ensure that the current column is incremented by the appropriate amount when encountering a tab character.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column + 4) // 4 * 4  # Adjust current column for tab character
            else:
                current_line += char
                if wait_for_nl:
                    if char == '\n':
                        if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                            res = ''.join(lines)
                            return res, prefix[len(res):]

                        lines.append(current_line)
                        current_line = ""
                        current_column = 0
                        wait_for_nl = False
                elif char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\n':
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected code, we handle the tab character separately and adjust the current column accordingly. This should ensure that the calculation of the current column is done correctly, addressing the incorrect indentation issue for comments after a dedent when the input file uses tabs.
