The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` seems to be incorrectly handling the indentation of comments in the prefix string. It appears that the function is intended to consume a prefix string up to a specific column, while taking into account spaces, tabs, and newlines for indentation.

Upon analysis of the provided test cases, it seems that the function is not correctly handling the indentation and newline characters, leading to incorrect behavior for tabulated comments after a dedent.

The function appears to incorrectly handle the indentation level when encountering tab characters and newlines, leading to the incorrect result.

To fix this bug, the function should correctly track the current indentation level and handle tab characters and newlines in a way that preserves the indentation level of the comments.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if current_column < column:
            current_line += char
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Assuming a tab is equivalent to 4 spaces
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
        res = ''.join(lines)
        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code should properly handle the indentation of the prefix string and correctly process tab characters and newlines while preserving the correct indentation level for comments.
