The bug occurs in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. The function is intended to partially consume the prefix based on the specified column. It keeps track of the current line, current column, and whether it needs to wait for a new line.

The bug occurs because the logic for handling indentation and new lines is incorrect. This causes the function to incorrectly consume the prefix and return the remaining part.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling indentation and new lines. Specifically, we need to ensure that the indentation is correctly accounted for and that the function correctly identifies when to wait for a new line.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                continue  # Skip the rest of the iteration as a new line has been encountered
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 8  # Assuming 8-character tabs
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
            continue  # Skip the rest of the iteration as a new line has been encountered
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected code:
- We added a `continue` statement after updating the `wait_for_nl` flag to skip the rest of the iteration when a new line is encountered.
- Adjusted the handling of tab characters to correctly account for the column width.
- Removed the unnecessary `else` statements to simplify the code flow.

With these corrections, the function should now correctly consume the prefix based on the specified column and handle indentation and new lines appropriately.
