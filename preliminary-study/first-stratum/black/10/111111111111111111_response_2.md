The error occurs in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function within the `Driver` class. The function is intended to process a prefix and return the consumed part and the remaining part of the prefix based on the column indentation. However, the logic within the function is not correctly handling the indentation and the presence of new lines.

The reason behind the bug is that the logic for handling indentation and new lines is not accurately implemented in the function. This causes incorrect handling of comments after a dedent.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be adjusted to correctly handle the indentation and new lines, ensuring that comments are indented correctly after a dedent. Additionally, the handling of whitespace characters such as spaces and tabs needs to be refined to accurately determine the column position.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_line += char
            current_column = 0
            continue
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected code, the function should be able to accurately handle the indentation and new lines, ensuring that comments are indented correctly after a dedent. This should resolve the issue described in the error message and the associated GitHub issue.
