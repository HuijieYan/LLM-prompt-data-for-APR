The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix string up to a certain column. The issue is that when the prefix contains tabs, the function incorrectly calculates the current column position, leading to errors in the prefix consumption.

The main problem lies in the handling of tabs in the `current_column` calculation. When a tab character is encountered, the function should increment `current_column` by the equivalent number of spaces (e.g., 4 spaces per tab), but it is currently incrementing by 1 instead.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle tab characters and calculate the `current_column` based on the tab width.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        tab_width = 4  # Assuming 4 spaces per tab
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += tab_width  # increment by tab width instead of 1
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle tab characters and calculate the `current_column` based on the tab width, resolving the indentation issues with tabulated comments after a dedent.
