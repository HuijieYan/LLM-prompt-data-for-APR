The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to process a prefix string character by character until a certain condition is met. However, it seems to have issues with correctly handling the indentation and newline characters, as evidenced by the test failures.

The bug occurs because the function does not correctly handle the indentation and newline characters, especially when it encounters a dedent (i.e., decreases in indentation level). This causes the comments to be misaligned after a dedent.

The possible approach to fixing the bug is to modify the logic for handling spaces, tabs, and newline characters. The function should maintain the correct tracking of the current indentation level and adjust the comments accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 8  # Assuming tab width as 8 for consistency
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            if current_line.strip():  # ignore empty lines
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code includes proper handling of indentation levels and newline characters, ensuring that comments are aligned correctly after a dedent.
