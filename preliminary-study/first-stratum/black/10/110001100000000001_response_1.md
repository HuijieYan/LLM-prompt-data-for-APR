Potential error location: The error is likely caused by the incorrect handling of the `wait_for_nl` flag and the conditions associated with it.

Reasons behind the bug: The `wait_for_nl` flag is not being handled properly, leading to incorrect parsing of the `prefix` string.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: We need to properly handle the `wait_for_nl` flag and the conditions associated with it to ensure correct parsing of the `prefix` string.

Corrected code:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_column += 1 if char == ' ' else 4 if char == '\t' else 0
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True if char != ' ' and char != '\t' else False
            
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
