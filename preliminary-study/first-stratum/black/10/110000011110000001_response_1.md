1. The test case appears to be comparing two different string outputs, `contents_tab` and `contents_spc`, using the `assertFormatEqual` function. The error message indicates that there is an assertion error because the two strings are not equal.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the `_partially_consume_prefix` method, where the string `prefix` is being processed to partially consume a prefix based on certain conditions.

3. The bug occurs because the current implementation of the `_partially_consume_prefix` method does not properly handle the indentation and comment lines in the prefix string, leading to incorrect partial consumption and mismatched string outputs.

4. To fix the bug, the `_partially_consume_prefix` method needs to be modified to correctly handle the indentations, comments, and line breaks within the prefix string. This can be achieved by adjusting the logic for consuming the prefix characters and properly identifying the end of each line in the prefix string.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == '#':
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
