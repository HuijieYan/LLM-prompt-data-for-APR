Potential error location: The "wait_for_nl" condition seems to be incorrectly implemented, causing the incorrect indentation.

Reasons behind the bug:
- The "wait_for_nl" condition is not correctly handling the indentation when encountering new lines, spaces, or tabs, resulting in incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Update the "wait_for_nl" condition to correctly handle new lines, spaces, and tabs to maintain the correct indentation.
- Adjust the logic to ensure that the indentation is preserved after a dedent.

Corrected code:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and len(current_line.expandtabs()) <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming 4 spaces for each tab
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0  # Reset column count for new line
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
