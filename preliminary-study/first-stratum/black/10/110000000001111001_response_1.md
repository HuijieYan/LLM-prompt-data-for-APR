The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume the prefix string based on a given column width. It appears that the function is not working as intended, as it is failing to split the prefix at the correct column width.

The potential error in this function occurs in the handling of indentation using spaces and tabs. The function fails to correctly update the `current_column` value, and it's not correctly identifying when an indent has finished and it's time to wait for a newline character.

To fix this bug, I suggest refactoring the logic for tracking the current column and detecting when an indent has finished.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming tab width is 4 spaces
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char
            if current_column >= column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
        if char != '\n':
            current_line += char
        else:
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

I have removed the `wait_for_nl` variable and instead checked for the current column width directly inside the loop. When the column width is exceeded, the function returns the consumed prefix and the remaining prefix string.
