The error occurs because the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not handling the indentation of comments correctly. The function is designed to consume part of a prefix string until a certain column is reached, but it does not account for the indentation of comments within the string.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the indentation of comments, ensuring that comments are aligned with the code based on the column provided.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming tab width is 4, adjust if required
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':  # Check for comment
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            current_line += prefix[prefix.index(char):]  # Include the entire comment in current_line
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected function, we have added a condition to handle the indentation of comments and include the entire comment in the `current_line`. This ensures that the comments are correctly aligned with the code based on the provided column.

After making these changes, the function should correctly handle the indentation of comments and resolve the bug in the test case mentioned.
