The error occurs when the `test_comment_indentation()` function is being run. The error message indicates that when comparing `fs(contents_tab)` with `contents_spc`, there is an assertion error indicating that the indentation for comments is incorrectly changed after a dedent.

The potential error location within the `Driver` class is the `_partially_consume_prefix` method, particularly in the logic that handles waiting for a new line (`'\n'`) character.

The bug occurs because the logic for handling the wait for a new line character is incorrect. The function attempts to maintain indentation levels by tracking the column count, but it does not properly handle the case where a comment is encountered after indentation. This results in the incorrect indentation of comments after a dedent.

One approach to fixing the bug is to refactor the logic for handling the wait for a new line character. Instead of manually tracking the column count, it might be better to keep track of the current indentation level and properly handle the indentation of comments.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix()` method:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    indent = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and indent < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                indent = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                indent += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                indent += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                indent = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, the function uses `indent` to keep track of the current indentation level and properly handles the indentation of comments.
