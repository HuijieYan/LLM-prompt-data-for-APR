The potential error in the given function is with how it handles the cases when a newline character is encountered. It seems that the function fails to properly handle the case where a newline character is encountered and the current column is less than the specified column parameter.

The reason for this bug is that the function does not correctly update the `current_column` variable when encountering a newline character. Additionally, the logic for checking if the current column is less than the specified column is not properly implemented.

To fix the bug, we can update the function to correctly handle the cases when a newline character is encountered and the current column is less than the specified column parameter. We also need to update the logic for the tab character ('\t') to properly increment the `current_column` by 4.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                else:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected code, we have updated the logic to properly handle the cases when encountering a newline character and when encountering a tab character. Additionally, we have added an else block for the case when the current column is less than the specified column.
