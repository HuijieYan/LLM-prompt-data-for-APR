The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix string and split it into lines based on a given column. However, the issue seems to be with the handling of tab characters and their impact on indentations for comments.

The bug occurs because the function does not correctly handle tab characters when calculating the column position. As a result, when there is a tab character in the prefix string, the function incorrectly calculates the column position and fails to maintain the correct indentation for comments.

To fix this issue, we need to update the logic for handling tab characters and calculating the column position. We can use the `expandtabs` method to calculate the correct column position after expanding the tab characters. This will ensure that the correct column position is maintained even when tab characters are present in the prefix string.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix.expandtabs():
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected code, the function will correctly handle tab characters and maintain the correct indentation for comments, resolving the bug reported in the issue.
