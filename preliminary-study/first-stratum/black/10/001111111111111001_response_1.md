The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` seems to be related to the handling of the `wait_for_nl` flag and the condition for appending lines within the loop. The function is designed to partially consume a prefix string based on a given column. It processes each character in the `prefix` string and appends lines based on the column and indentation level.

The bug occurs when the function incorrectly handles the `wait_for_nl` flag. This causes unexpected behavior when determining whether to add the current line to the lines list.

To fix this bug, the condition for appending lines should be modified to ensure that the current line is added to the `lines` list at the correct indentation level. Additionally, the flag `wait_for_nl` should be updated based on the current character being processed.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if current_column < column:
            current_line += char
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
        else:
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After applying this fix, the function should correctly process the prefix string based on the provided column, and the test case `test_comment_indentation` should pass without errors.
