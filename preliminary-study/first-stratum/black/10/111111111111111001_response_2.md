The error message indicates that there is a mismatch between the expected and actual output of the `assertFormatEqual` function. Looking at the test cases, it seems that the function `fs` is expected to format the input string `contents_tab` in a specific way, which is not happening correctly.

The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a portion of the input string `prefix` based on the value of `column`. It keeps track of the lines and columns to correctly consume the prefix string. However, there seems to be an issue with the logic within the function, resulting in incorrect behavior.

The function does not properly handle indentation levels, especially when dealing with spaces and tabs. The check for a newline character seems to be causing unexpected behavior, and the updating of `current_column` is incorrect.

To fix the bug, the function should handle indentation levels properly, update the `current_column` based on the number of spaces and tabs, and correctly consume the prefix string based on the `column` value.

Here's the corrected code for the `:_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Assuming 4 spaces per tab
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line + char)  # Include the newline character in the line
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_column += 1  # Consider other characters as a single column
                current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these corrections, the function should now correctly consume the prefix string based on the given column value, handling indentation levels and newline characters appropriately. The corrected function should address the bug and produce the expected output for the test cases.
