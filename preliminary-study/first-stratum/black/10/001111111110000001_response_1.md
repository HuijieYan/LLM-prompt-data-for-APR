The error message is coming from the `test_comment_indentation` test function, specifically from the `assertFormatEqual(fs(contents_tab), contents_spc)` line, indicating that the output from `fs(contents_tab)` is not equal to `contents_spc`.

Upon reviewing the buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix`, it seems that the logic for handling indentation and comments is incorrect. The issue lies in the `wait_for_nl` condition, which is not being handled properly for comments.

The potential reason for the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the case when a line contains both code and a comment. When the function encounters a line with both code and comment, it fails to correctly process and consume the prefix leading to the comment.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for handling comments and ensure that the prefix is correctly consumed, including the comment portion.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            else:
                current_column += 1
                continue
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            res = ''.join(lines)
            return res, prefix[len(res):]
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This correction ensures that all characters including the comment are processed correctly, allowing the function to consume the proper prefix.
