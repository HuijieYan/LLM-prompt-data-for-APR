The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is caused by the incorrect handling of the indentation level when processing the prefix string. This leads to incorrect tracking of the current column and incorrect splitting of the prefix into lines.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of updating the current column and lines, and also how the function handles the wait for a new line.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code ensures that the current column and lines are correctly updated based on the indentation characters, and the wait for a new line is handled properly.
