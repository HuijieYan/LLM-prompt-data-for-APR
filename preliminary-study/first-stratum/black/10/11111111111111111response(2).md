The issue seems to be related to the incorrect handling of comments with different indentation levels in the `Driver` class' `_partially_consume_prefix` method. The method incorrectly handles the indentation level of comments after a dedent.

The error message from the test function indicates that the actual result is not equal to the expected result after processing the input contents. This suggests that the buggy function is not correctly handling the indentation of comments.

Looking at the function, it seems to have logic for tracking indentation levels and handling different types of characters, but the approach might be over-complicated and leading to incorrect behavior.

The bug occurs because the `_partially_consume_prefix` method does not handle the correct indentation for comments after a dedent. The indentation level is not correctly reset after a dedent, leading to incorrect behavior when processing comments with different indentation levels.

To address this bug, the logic for tracking the current indentation level and handling comments after a dedent needs to be revised. Simplifying the logic and ensuring that the correct indentation level is maintained will likely resolve this issue.

The corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` method is as follows:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
                
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these changes, the method should correctly handle the indentation levels for comments after dedents, resolving the bug.
