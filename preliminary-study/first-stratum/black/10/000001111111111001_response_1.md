The error seems to be related to the `assertFormatEqual` test method, which compares the expected formatted string with the actual formatted string. The error message indicates that the comparison failed for the `contents_tab` variable.

Upon analyzing the buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix`, it seems that the issue might be related to the handling of the `wait_for_nl` condition and the indentation level (`column`). The function is designed to partially consume the prefix based on the given column value.

The bug occurs because the condition for checking the column level is incorrect. This results in incorrect handling of the prefix string, leading to unexpected behavior in the test case.

To fix the bug, the logic for updating the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` should be revised to accurately track the indentation level and handle the newline characters.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False  # Reset the wait_for_nl flag when encountering a newline
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

This revised function includes a correction to the logic for handling the newline characters and correctly updating the `wait_for_nl` flag and the `current_column` based on different indentation characters.

With these corrections, the function should now accurately consume the prefix based on the specified column value, and the test case should pass without any assertion errors.
