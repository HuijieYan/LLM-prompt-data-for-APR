Potential Error:
The function is not correctly handling the case where the prefix ends with a newline character.

Reason for the Bug:
The code does not correctly handle the situation where the prefix ends with a newline character. The variable `current_line` does not get appended to `lines`, so the result is incorrect.

Possible Fix:
We need to append the remaining `current_line` to `lines` before returning the result. Additionally, we should reset `current_line` after the loop to ensure all characters are consumed.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    # Append any remaining characters to lines
    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```
