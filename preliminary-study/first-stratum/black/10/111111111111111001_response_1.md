The test case `test_comment_indentation` compares the formatting of two code snippets. It seems that the error occurs when comparing the formatting of the contents of `contents_spc` and `contents_tab` in the second set of comparisons. This comparison fails because the indentation of the comment is incorrect in one of the snippets, leading to a formatting mismatch.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the '_partially_consume_prefix' function. It seems that the function is not handling the indentation of comments correctly.

The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle the indentation of comments in Python code. The function is designed to consume a prefix of code up to a certain column, but it fails to correctly account for the indentation of comments.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to modify the logic of the function to handle comment indentation properly. This can be done by checking for comment characters and adjusting the column and line handling accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the '_partially_consume_prefix' function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':  # handle indentation of comments
            current_column = len(current_line) - len(current_line.lstrip())
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
