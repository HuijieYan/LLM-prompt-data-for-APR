The error occurs in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, as it is responsible for handling the indentation of comments. In the test function `test_comment_indentation`, there is an assertion error due to incorrect comment indentation.

The bug occurs when the function encounters a comment after a dedent. It fails to handle the correct indentation for the comment, leading to the incorrect output.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles the indentation for comments after a dedent. One approach is to track the current indentation level and adjust the comment indentation accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    prev_indent = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                prev_indent = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            prev_indent += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            prev_indent += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            prev_indent = 0
        else:
            # indent or dedent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_column -= prev_indent  # adjust column based on previous indent level
            prev_indent = 0
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code includes tracking the previous indent level and adjusting the current column based on the previous indent level when encountering comments after a dedent. This should ensure that the comment indentation is handled correctly, resolving the bug observed in the test case.
