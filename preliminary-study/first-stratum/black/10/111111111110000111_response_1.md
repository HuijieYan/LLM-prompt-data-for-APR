The error occurs because the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not handling the indentation for comments correctly. This results in incorrect indentation when the input file uses tabs. The function needs to correctly handle the indentation for comments after a dedent.

The potential error location within the function is the condition `wait_for_nl` not being properly handled when encountering a new line character.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
- Reset `wait_for_nl` to False after appending a line in the `lines` list.
- Adjust the indentation based on the `current_column` when encountering a comment.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
# Corrected function
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column and current_line.strip():
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # Adjust comment indentation when encounter a comment character
            if char == '#':
                current_column = column
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now handle comment indentation correctly and resolve the reported issue.
