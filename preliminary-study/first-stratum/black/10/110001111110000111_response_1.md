The error occurs when the `test_comment_indentation` test case is run. The `assertFormatEqual` method compares the expected and actual formatted strings, and it fails with an AssertionError. The error message indicates a difference in the indentation of the comment. 

Upon analyzing the code, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be the potential location of the bug. The function is used to handle indentation and prefixes in the code formatting.

The reason for the bug is that the current implementation of `_partially_consume_prefix` does not correctly handle the indentation level for comments after a dedent. This leads to incorrect indentations for comments, especially when using tabs instead of spaces.

To fix the bug, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should be updated to correctly handle the indentation level for comments. This can be done by ensuring that the function properly tracks the current indentation level and adjusts it accordingly when encountering comments.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # adjust based on the tab width
        elif char == '\n':
            # reset current_column to 0 when encountering a new line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected code, the `current_column` is appropriately adjusted for tab characters, and the indentation level is reset when encountering a new line. This should ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation for comments, fixing the bug.
