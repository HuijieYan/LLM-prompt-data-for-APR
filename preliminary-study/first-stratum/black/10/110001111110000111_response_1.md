The error occurs in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. This function is part of the Black code formatting tool and is used to handle indentation during the formatting process. The error message from the test function indicates that the indentation for comments past depth 0 is changed incorrectly after a dedent.

The potential error location within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is the handling of the `wait_for_nl` flag and the logic related to indentations using spaces and tabs.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the indentation level when encountering a comment after a dedent, causing the incorrect formatting of comments.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to revise the logic for handling indentation levels and comments to ensure that the correct behavior is maintained when encountering comments after a dedent.

Corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_indent = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_indent:
            if char != ' ' and char != '\t':
                wait_for_indent = False
            else:
                current_column += 1 if char == ' ' else 4
        if wait_for_indent or char == ' ' or char == '\t':
            continue
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_indent = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This revised code includes a more explicit handling of the `wait_for_indent` flag and adjusts the logic for correctly handling the indentation levels and comments after a dedent.
