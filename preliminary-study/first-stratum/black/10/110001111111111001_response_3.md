The error message from the test function is an assertion error. It seems that the test is failing because the expected and actual output strings are not matching. The error occurs at line 517 of the test_black.py file.

The buggy function _partially_consume_prefix has a logic issue. It fails to correctly handle the indentation level when encountering a comment. This results in incorrect indentation of the comment in the output.

The reason for the bug is that the function does not account for the indentation level when it encounters a comment. It only checks the column position but does not adjust the indentation of the comment accordingly.

To fix the bug, we should modify the logic of the function to correctly handle the indentation level when encountering a comment. We can achieve this by calculating the correct indentation level for the comment based on the current_column and current_line. Then, we can adjust the comment indentation accordingly before returning the output.

Here's the corrected code for the _partially_consume_prefix function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, ' ' * (column - len(res)) + prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), ' ' * column + current_line
```
