The test case `test_comment_indentation` compares the output of the `fs` function for `contents_tab` and `contents_spc`. The error message indicates that the expected and actual outputs don't match for the `contents_tab` input.

After analyzing the code, it seems that the issue might be related to how the `partially_consume_prefix` method handles tab characters and their corresponding indentations. When the function encounters a tab character, it increments the `current_column` by 4, indicating that it's assuming each tab character represents 4 spaces. This might lead to incorrect calculations of the current column, especially when converting between tab characters and spaces.

The initial reason behind the bug is the incorrect handling of tab characters and their corresponding indentations. As a result, when the function deals with tab characters and spaces in the prefix input, it doesn't accurately calculate the current column, leading to the incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that tab characters are correctly handled and that their corresponding indentations are accurately calculated. We should also consider different scenarios when dealing with newline characters, spaces, and tabs.

Here's the modified `partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            spaces_to_add = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_line += ' ' * spaces_to_add
            current_column += spaces_to_add
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this modification, we handle tab characters separately and ensure that their corresponding spaces are correctly calculated. By addressing the issues related to tab characters and their indentations, this should resolve the bug.
