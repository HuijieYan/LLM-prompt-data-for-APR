The bug occurs in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. The function is intended to partially consume a prefix string based on a given indentation column. The bug causes incorrect behavior when the input prefix contains tabs.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle tab characters properly when calculating the current column. This leads to incorrect indentation handling, especially for comments after a dedent.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly handle tab characters and calculate the current column based on the indentation level.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
            current_line += char
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code properly handles tab characters and calculates the current column based on the indentation level, ensuring correct behavior for comments after a dedent.
