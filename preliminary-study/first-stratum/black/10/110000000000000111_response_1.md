Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the portion of the code that handles the indentation and newline characters.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of tab characters ('\t') and the logic for tracking indentation levels. When encountering a tab character, the code incorrectly increments the current_column by 4 instead of considering the tab width, which results in incorrect column tracking. Additionally, the wait_for_nl logic seems to be causing issues with the correct identification of new lines and their associated indentation levels.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the code to correctly handle tab characters by appropriately tracking the column position and incrementing it by the actual tab width. 
2. Revise the logic for tracking new lines and indentation levels to ensure accurate handling of comments and code indentation.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            # Calculate the actual column position after encountering a tab
            tab_width = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_column += tab_width
        elif char == '\n':
            if wait_for_nl:
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                else:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        else:
            # indent is finished
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
