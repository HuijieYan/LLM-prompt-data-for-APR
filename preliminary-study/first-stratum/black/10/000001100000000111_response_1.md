Potential Error Location:
The issue seems to be related to the handling of tab characters and their impact on the indentation level of comments.

Reasons for the Bug:
The current implementation does not properly handle tab characters when calculating the current column. This leads to incorrectly adjusted indentation for comments after a dedent.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the logic for calculating the current column to handle tab characters correctly.
2. Ensure that the indentation level for comments is maintained consistently, especially after a dedent.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            tab_width = 4
            spaces_to_add = tab_width - (current_column % tab_width)
            current_line += ' ' * spaces_to_add
            current_column += spaces_to_add
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1 if char == ' ' else len(char.encode('utf-8'))
        if char == "\n":
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
