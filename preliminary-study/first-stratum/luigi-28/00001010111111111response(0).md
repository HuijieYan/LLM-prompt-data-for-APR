The bug in the provided code is in the `table_exists` function. The bug causes the function to be case sensitive when checking for the existence of a table in the database.

The error message from the test function indicates that when checking for the existence of a table, the function returns False instead of True, leading to an assertion error.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle case sensitivity. When comparing the table name provided by the user with the table names obtained from the database, it does not account for case differences. This results in the incorrect evaluation of table existence, as seen in the test case.

To fix this bug, the function should convert both the table name provided by the user and the table names obtained from the database to the same case (e.g., lower case) before performing the comparison.

Here is the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}" partition (%s);'.format(database, table) % self.partition_spec(partition))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected code, both the table name provided and the table names obtained from the database are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before the comparison is made. This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive and the function works correctly for both upper and lower case table names.
