1. The error message indicates that the test case 'test_table_exists' is failing at the line `self.assertTrue(returned)`. This suggests that the `table_exists` function is not returning the expected result when checking for a table with a different case.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of the table name in the `table_exists` function. It seems like the function is not handling the case sensitivity of the table name when checking for its existence.

3. The bug occurs because the 'table_exists' function does not handle case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command. This causes the test case to fail when checking for a table with a different case.

4. To fix the bug, the 'table_exists' function should convert both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase and then perform the comparison. This will make the comparison case insensitive.

5. Here's the corrected code for the 'table_exists' function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        partition_spec_output = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} {2};'.format(database, table, partition_spec_output))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected code converts both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase using the `lower()` function and then checks for table existence. This will make the comparison case insensitive, fixing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
