The bug in the `table_exists` method is due to a case sensitivity issue. When checking for the existence of a table, the method does not take into account the case of the table name. This causes the method to fail when searching for a table with a different case than what is returned by Hive.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the method to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` method:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1}'.format(database, table))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected code, we use the `lower()` method to convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparing them, which makes the comparison case insensitive.

This change will ensure that the `table_exists` method correctly handles tables with different casing and should resolve the issue reported in the test function and GitHub issue.
