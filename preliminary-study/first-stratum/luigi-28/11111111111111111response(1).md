The bug occurs when the `table_exists` function is called with a table name that differs in case from the actual table name in the Hive database. The function compares the exact case of the table name with the output from the Hive command, leading to a false assertion when the cases don't match.

To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive. This can be done by converting both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this change, the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command will be case-insensitive, and the test cases should pass without any assertion errors.
