The error occurs in the `table_exists` method. It fails to handle the case insensitivity of table names in the Hive database. When the `table_exists` method is called with a table name in different cases, it returns incorrect results.

The reason for the bug is that the method directly compares the table name provided with the output from the Hive commands, which may have a different case. This causes the method to return incorrect results, leading to the test failures.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` method to make it case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The comparison should be done after converting both the table name and the Hive command output to lowercase.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` method:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}" {2};'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With these changes, the `table_exists` method should now handle case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database.

This fix addresses the issue described in the GitHub issues titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" and "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive".
