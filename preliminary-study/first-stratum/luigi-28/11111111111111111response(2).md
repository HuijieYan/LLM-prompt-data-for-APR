The issue seems to be related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence. The test case "test_table_exists" is failing when checking for a table with a different case from what is returned in the output.

The bug is likely caused by a case-sensitive comparison of the table name with the output of the "run_hive_cmd" function. In the "table_exists" function, there is a comparison between the provided table name and the output from the "run_hive_cmd" function. This comparison does not take into account the case sensitivity of the table names.

To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the output from the "run_hive_cmd" function should be made case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the "table_exists" function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this change, the comparison for table existence will be case insensitive, and the test case should pass without errors.
