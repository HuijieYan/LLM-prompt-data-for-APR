The problem with the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case sensitivity correctly. The function should be case insensitive when checking if a table exists, but it is currently case sensitive.

The error message from the test function indicates that the test for case insensitivity is failing, which suggests that the `table_exists` function is not handling case sensitivity correctly.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should convert the table name to lowercase before checking if it exists in the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. This will make the comparison case insensitive and ensure that the function works correctly for tables with different cases.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1}.{2}'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected code, the `table.lower()` function is used to convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. This will make the comparison case insensitive and fix the bug.

This correction will resolve the issue reported in the test function and the associated GitHub issue.
