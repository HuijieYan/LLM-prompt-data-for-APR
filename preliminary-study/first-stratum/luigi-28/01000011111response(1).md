1. The test case involves checking if the `table_exists` method correctly identifies the existence of the table, irrespective of the case of the table name. The error message indicates that the method is currently case-sensitive, leading to failed assertions when the case of the table name differs.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of the table name with the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. This comparison is causing the method to be case-sensitive, leading to the failed assertions.

3. The bug occurs because the `table_exists` method does not perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. As a result, the method is unable to correctly identify the existence of the table when the case of the table name differs from the case of the returned output.

4. One possible approach for fixing the bug is to convert both the table name and the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to lowercase and then perform the comparison. This would make the comparison case-insensitive, allowing the method to accurately identify the existence of the table.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` method:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        partition_exists = self.partition_spec(partition)

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower() and partition_exists
```

In the corrected code, both the table name and the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before performing the comparison. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, resolving the bug.
