The potential error in the problematic function is in the second part of the `if-else` statement, specifically in the line `stdout = run_hive_cmd( % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))`. It seems that there is a syntax error and the `%` operator might be misplaced.

The bug occurs because the `%` operator is not used correctly to format the string. This is causing a syntax error and preventing the function from executing properly.

To fix this bug, the `%` operator should be properly used to format the string with the database, table, and partition_spec.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_string = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}" PARTITION ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_string))
        return bool(stdout)
```
