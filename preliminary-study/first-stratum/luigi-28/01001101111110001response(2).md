The test case calls the `table_exists` method of the `HiveCommandClient` object with different inputs and asserts the output. The error message "AssertionError: False is not true" indicates that the expected output was not obtained for one of the test cases.

The potential error location within the `table_exists` method is in the conditional statement where it checks for the existence of a table in the database.

The bug occurs because the function doesn't handle the case where the table name provided in the input is not an exact match with the table names in the database. The comparison should be case-insensitive to match the behavior described in the test case.

The bug can be fixed by modifying the conditional statement to perform a case-insensitive comparison when checking for the existence of the table in the database.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` method:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()  # Perform case-insensitive comparison
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
