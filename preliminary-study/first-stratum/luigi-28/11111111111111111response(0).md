The bug in the `table_exists` method is due to the case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the tables returned in the `stdout` from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

To fix this bug, we need to compare the tables in a case-insensitive manner. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` method:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparing, we ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive, as expected by the test cases and the bug report.
