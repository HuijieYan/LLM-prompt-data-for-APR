The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the comparison of the table name in a case-sensitive manner. In the test case, when the function is called with a table name in mixed case (e.g., "MyTable"), the comparison fails because the function checks for an exact match without considering the case.

To fix this bug, the comparison should be made case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to lower case before comparing them.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
```

With this change, the comparison is now case-insensitive, and the function should work correctly for all variations of table names.
