The error in the provided code is in the `table_exists` function. 

The bug occurs because when the `table_exists` function is called with a table name, it first converts the table name to lowercase to compare with the result of the `run_hive_cmd` function. This causes a problem when the table name is provided with mixed cases because it doesn't match the result returned from `run_hive_cmd`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison is case insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the result from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}" partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_spec))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected code will ensure that the comparison between the table name and the result from `run_hive_cmd` is done in a case-insensitive manner, fixing the bug.
