The potential error location within the problematic function is with the `run_hive_cmd` function calls. In the `table_exists` function, when the `partition` parameter is not None, the `stdout` variable is assigned the result of the `run_hive_cmd` function call with the `%` operator between the database, table, and the result of `self.partition_spec(partition)`. This usage of the `%` operator is incorrect.

The bug occurs because the `%` operator is used incorrectly in the buggy function when the `partition` parameter is not None. The correct way to format the string for the `run_hive_cmd` call is by using the `format` method like in the first `run_hive_cmd` call.

To fix the bug, the corrected code for the `table_exists` function is as follows:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}" % {2};'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected code, we are using the `format` method to properly format the string for the `run_hive_cmd` call when the `partition` parameter is not None. This should resolve the bug and make the `table_exists` function work as expected.
