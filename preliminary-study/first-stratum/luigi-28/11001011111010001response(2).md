The error is likely occurring in the `table_exists` function, where the conditional statement is not handling the partition case correctly. The function is not properly checking if the table exists in the given database, possibly due to incorrect formatting of the Hive command for the partition case.

The bug occurs because when `partition` is not None, the `run_hive_cmd` function is called with incorrect formatting using the `%` operator. This may lead to incorrect command execution and therefore incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the `run_hive_cmd` function should be called with the correct formatting when `partition` is not None. Also, the conditional statement for checking the existence of the table should be modified to handle the partition case correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_string = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}" partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_string))
        return stdout and table in stdout
```
