1. The test case is checking if the function `table_exists` returns the correct value when provided with different table names. The error message indicates that the test is failing because the returned value is not as expected.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `else` part of the `table_exists` method where the `run_hive_cmd` is being called.

3. The bug occurred because the function `table_exists` is not handling case insensitivity for table names. The test is failing when checking for `MyTable` because the function does not take case sensitivity into account.

4. To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the output from `run_hive_cmd`. This will ensure that the comparison is case insensitive and the test cases should pass.

5. Corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}" {2};'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout.lower() == table.lower()
```

In this corrected code, we convert both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before performing the comparison. This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive and the test cases should pass.
