1. The test case is checking the behavior of the `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class. It first calls the function with the table name "mytable" and expects the return value to be False. Then it calls the function again with the same table name and expects the return value to be True. Finally, it calls the function with a table name "MyTable" and expects the return value to be True.

2. The potential error location is within the `table_exists` function where the condition for checking the existence of the table is implemented.

3. The bug occurs because the `table_exists` function is not handling the case sensitivity of the table name. When it retrieves the table information from stdout, it does not take into account the case of the table name provided.

4. One approach to fix the bug is to convert both the table name and the retrieved table information to lowercase before comparing them. This will make the comparison case-insensitive and ensure that the function works as expected regardless of the case of the table name.

5. ```python
   class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
       def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
           if partition is None:
               stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
               return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
           else:
               stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
               return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
   ```
