The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it compares the table name directly with the output of the Hive command, which is case sensitive. This causes the function to fail when the case of the table name doesn't match exactly with the output from Hive.

To fix this bug, the comparison should be case insensitive. The corrected function should convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

With this fix, the function should now correctly check for the existence of a table in a case-insensitive manner.
