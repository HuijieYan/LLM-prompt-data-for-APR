The bug in the `table_exists` function is likely caused by the conditional check for the presence of the table in the Hive command output. The function checks for the presence of the table using the `run_hive_cmd` function, and depending on the output, it returns either True or False. The bug is likely related to how the presence of the table is being checked in the command output.

To fix this bug, the function should properly parse the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to check for the presence of the table. Additionally, it should also handle case insensitivity for the table name.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    table = table.lower()  # Convert the table name to lowercase for case insensitivity
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.lower()  # Check for the presence of the table in the command output with case insensitivity
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function should properly handle the case insensitivity of the table name and correctly check for the presence of the table in the command output. This should resolve the AssertionError in the test function.
