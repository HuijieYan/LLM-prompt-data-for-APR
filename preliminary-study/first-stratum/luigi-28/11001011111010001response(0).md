The bug is in the `table_exists` function. The bug occurs because the `run_hive_cmd` function is being called with incorrect arguments when a partition is specified. The format of the string to be passed to `run_hive_cmd` is incorrect.

To fix this bug, the `run_hive_cmd` function should be called with the correct arguments for each case, using the correct string formatting.

Below is the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}"'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_string = '/'.join(['{0}={1}'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        query = 'use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition_string)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(query)
        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected code, we ensure that the `run_hive_cmd` function is called with the correct arguments for both cases (with or without a partition specified), using the correct string formatting. This should fix the bug and make the test case pass.
