The problem in the `table_exists` function seems to be the incorrect use of string formatting in the `run_hive_cmd` call when `partition` is not None. The way `% (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))` is used suggests that it may have been intended to use a format string. 

The bug occurs because the string formatting operator `%` is used incorrectly. It should be used with a format string. Additionally, the logic inside the function could be simplified for better readability.

To fix the bug, use the `.format()` method for string formatting and simplify the conditional logic. 

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_str = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}" partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_str))
        return bool(stdout)
```

The corrected function uses the `.format()` method for string formatting, simplifies the conditional logic, and improves the readability of the code. This should address the bug and produce the expected results.
