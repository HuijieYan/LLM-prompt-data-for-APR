The error in the `table_exists` function might be occurring due to the incorrect handling of the `stdout` variable and the condition checks.

The buggy function has a conditional statement that checks the value of `stdout` and returns `True` or `False` based on that. However, the condition checks are not handling all possible cases correctly, leading to incorrect return values.

To fix this bug, we can modify the conditional checks to properly handle the different scenarios, specifically when `stdout` contains the table name.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_str = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, partition_str))

        return stdout.strip() != ""
```

In the corrected code, we include proper handling of the `stdout` variable for when the partition is specified. We also ensure that the return value is based on whether the `stdout` contains any partitions.

This should resolve the issue with the test case failing and the incorrect return values.
