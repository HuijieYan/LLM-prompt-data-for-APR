The error in the code is likely related to the `table_exists` function, specifically in the conditional statements. The function attempts to determine if a table exists in a database within a Hive environment. The bug occurs when a partition is specified, causing the function to generate incorrect Hive commands.

The buggy function can be fixed by modifying the conditional statements and correcting the formatting of the Hive command strings. The function should also handle cases with different capitalizations of table names by converting them to lowercase for consistency.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        partition_filter = ' and '.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_filter))
        return bool(stdout)
```
