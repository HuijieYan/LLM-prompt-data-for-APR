The buggy function `table_exists` has a few issues. First, the conditional block for when `partition` is not None makes a call to `run_hive_cmd` with an incorrect argument. The line `stdout = run_hive_cmd( % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))` lacks proper formatting. It seems that it should be formatted as `stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))`. Additionally, the condition to return True when `stdout` is not empty should be `if stdout and table in stdout:` rather than just `if stdout:`.

The test function provided uses mock objects to simulate the `run_hive_cmd` function and make assertions on the behavior of the `table_exists` function. The test checks different scenarios of inputs and partition specifications.

The issues in the buggy function originate from an incorrect formatting of the `run_hive_cmd` call and an incorrect condition for checking the presence of the table in the command output.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should be corrected as follows:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}" PARTITION ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout and table in stdout
```

With these changes, the function properly formats the `run_hive_cmd` call and checks if the table is present in the command output.
