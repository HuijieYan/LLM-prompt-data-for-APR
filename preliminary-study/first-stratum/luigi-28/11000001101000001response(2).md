Potential Error Location: The issue lies in the `table_exists` function's conditional statement for handling the case when a partition is not None.

Reason for Bug: In the conditional block for handling the case when a partition is not None, there is a syntax error in the `run_hive_cmd` function call. Additionally, the condition provided to determine the return value is not correct.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug: 
1. Fix the syntax error in the `run_hive_cmd` function call.
2. Update the condition and logic for handling the case when a partition is not None.

Corrected Code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}" PARTITION ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout and table in stdout
```
