The bug in the `table_exists` method is due to the case sensitivity of the table name when checking for its existence in the Hive database. When the table name is provided in a different case than the one stored in the database, the method incorrectly returns False, leading to test failures.

To fix this bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting the table name to lowercase before performing the comparison with the stdout.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` method:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}" partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_spec))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected code, we use the `lower()` method to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them. This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive and the method will return the correct result.

This fix addresses the case sensitivity issue and aligns with the proposed fix in the GitHub issue titled "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive."
