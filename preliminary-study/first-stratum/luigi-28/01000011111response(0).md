1. The test case is checking whether the "table_exists" function correctly identifies the existence of a table, regardless of case. It is mocking the "run_hive_cmd" function to return different values and checking the output of the "table_exists" function against these values. The error message indicates that the test fails when the table name is different case from what is returned by the "run_hive_cmd" function.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of table names in the "table_exists" function. It seems to be performing a case-sensitive comparison, leading to the test failure.

3. The bug occurs because the "table_exists" function does not account for case sensitivity when comparing the table name returned by the "run_hive_cmd" function with the provided table name.

4. To fix the bug, the "table_exists" function should convert both the table name and the output from "run_hive_cmd" to lowercase and then compare them. This will ensure a case-insensitive comparison and make the function more robust.

5. The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower() and self.partition_spec(partition) in stdout
```
