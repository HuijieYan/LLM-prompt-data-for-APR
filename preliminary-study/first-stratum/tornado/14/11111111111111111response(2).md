The test function `test_force_current` creates an instance of `IOLoop` with `make_current=True`, which calls the `initialize` method. This method then checks if the current `IOLoop` exists, and if so, raises a `RuntimeError`. The error message indicates that the current `IOLoop` already exists, even though the previous line checked that it is `None`.

The potential error location is in the `initialize` method, specifically in the conditional statement that checks if the current `IOLoop` exists.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the conditional logic in the `initialize` method is incorrect. It is mistakenly raising a `RuntimeError` even when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`. We should remove the unnecessary if-else statement and directly check if `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` exists, then raise a `RuntimeError`.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False):
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is None and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected code, the conditional logic properly checks if `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` exists, and only then raises a `RuntimeError`. If `make_current` is `None` and the current `IOLoop` does not exist, it sets the current `IOLoop`.
