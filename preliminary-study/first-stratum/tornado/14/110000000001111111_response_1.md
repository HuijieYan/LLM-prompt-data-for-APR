The issue seems to be with the logic of the `initialize` function. It is meant to check if an IOLoop already exists, and if not, make it the current one. However, there seems to be a mistake in the logic that is causing the function to sometimes raise a RuntimeError even when an IOLoop already exists.

The issue lies in the condition `if make_current is None`. When `make_current` is `True`, the intention is to check if an IOLoop already exists and if not, make it the current one. However, the current logic also allows for the possibility of raising a RuntimeError if an IOLoop already exists even when `make_current` is `True`, which may not be the intended behavior.

To fix this issue, we can modify the logic of the `initialize` function to ensure that it only raises a RuntimeError if `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop already exists. If `make_current` is `None`, then the function should also make the IOLoop the current one if it doesn't already exist.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the cases where `make_current` is `None` or `True`, and correctly check if an IOLoop already exists before raising a RuntimeError.
