The potential error location within the `initialize` function is the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`. This condition is meant to check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, but it is using the incorrect signature of the `current` function. The correct signature of the `current` function should be `def current(cls=None, instance=True)`, where `cls` is the class being checked for the current instance. 

The bug occurred because the `if` condition in the `initialize` function is using the incorrect signature of the `current` function, leading to a comparison between incorrect types.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `initialize` function to use the correct signature of the `current` function and specify the class `IOLoop` when calling the `current` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(IOLoop, instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(IOLoop, instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
By specifying the class `IOLoop` when calling the `current` function, we ensure that we are checking for the current instance of the correct class, fixing the bug in the `initialize` function.
