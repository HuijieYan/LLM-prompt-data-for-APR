The bug occurs in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The problem lies in the following code block:

```python
if make_current is None:
    if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        self.make_current()
elif make_current:
    if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    self.make_current()
```

When the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`, the code checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, and if not, it raises a `RuntimeError`. However, the logic is flawed because even if there's no current `IOLoop` instance, it still tries to make the current `IOLoop` instance.

To fix this bug, we should remove the redundant conditional block and simply make the current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True`. If there is already a current instance, it should raise a `RuntimeError`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()

# Remove the previous definitions of `current` and `make_current` as they do not seem to be relevant to the issue.
```

In this corrected code, we directly check if `make_current` is `True`, and if so, we ensure that no current `IOLoop` instance exists before making the current instance. If a current instance already exists, it raises a `RuntimeError` as expected.
