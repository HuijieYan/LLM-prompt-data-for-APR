The error occurs in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The issue arises because when `make_current` is True, the code first checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, and if it is, then it raises `RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")`. This is contradictory because if it's None, it means the current `IOLoop` doesn't exist, but the code incorrectly raises an error for the opposite condition.

To fix this issue, we need to update the logic inside the `initialize` method. We should raise the `RuntimeError` only when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None and `make_current` is True.

The corrected code for the `initialize` method is as follows:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making these changes, we ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when a current `IOLoop` instance already exists, and `make_current` is set to True.
