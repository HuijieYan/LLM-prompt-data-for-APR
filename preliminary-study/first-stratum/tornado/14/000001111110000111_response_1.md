The test case `test_force_current` is trying to create an instance of `IOLoop` with `make_current=True`, which should set the current `IOLoop` instance. However, it is raising a `RuntimeError` indicating that the current `IOLoop` already exists.

The potential error location within the `initialize` function is in the condition `if make_current is None`, where it checks if the current `IOLoop` is None and then calls `self.make_current()`. This logic seems to be causing the issue.

The reason behind the bug is that the logic for checking the current `IOLoop` instance and setting the current instance is incorrect. It is not handling the case when the current `IOLoop` already exists properly.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to refactor the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the setting of the current `IOLoop` instance. This may involve checking if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists and only then raising a `RuntimeError`.

Here is the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function will first check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists, and only if it does not exist, it will set the current instance. Otherwise, it will raise a `RuntimeError` indicating that the current `IOLoop` instance already exists. This should resolve the issue described in the bug report.
