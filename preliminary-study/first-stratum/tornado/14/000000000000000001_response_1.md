Potential Error Location: The potential error in this function is within the 'initialize' method, where it checks if 'make_current' is None and then attempts to call 'self.make_current()' without a defined attribute or method 'make_current'.

Reasons for Bug: The bug occurs because the function is trying to call 'self.make_current()' without checking if the method or attribute 'make_current' exists within the class.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: We can fix this bug by checking if the 'make_current' method or attribute exists within the class before trying to call it.

Corrected Code:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if getattr(self, 'make_current', None) and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
In the corrected code, we use the 'getattr' function to check if the 'make_current' method exists within the class before attempting to call it. This helps to avoid calling the method if it does not exist and prevents the error.
