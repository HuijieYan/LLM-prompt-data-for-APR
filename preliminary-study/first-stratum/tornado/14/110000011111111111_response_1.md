The test case `test_force_current` is trying to create an instance of `IOLoop` with the `make_current` parameter set to `True`. It then checks if the created instance is the current instance using `IOLoop.current()`, and then tries to create another instance with `make_current` set to `True`, expecting it to raise a `RuntimeError`. However, it fails with a `RuntimeError` that the "current IOLoop already exists".

The potential error location within the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class is in the `elif make_current` block. Here, it checks if `make_current` is `True`, and if the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None`, it raises a `RuntimeError`. However, the intention seems to be to raise the error if the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None`.

The bug occurs because the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` should be `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:` to correctly check if the current instance exists.

To fix the bug, the condition should be reversed and corrected to check if the current instance actually exists before raising a `RuntimeError`.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
