Potential error location: The if condition for make_current is not properly handling the case when make_current is True.

Reasons behind the bug: The if condition is checking for make_current being None, but it is not considering the case when make_current is True.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Modify the if condition to consider the case when make_current is True and refactor the code for better readability.

Corrected code:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
