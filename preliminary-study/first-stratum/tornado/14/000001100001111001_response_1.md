The error occurs in the `initialize` function where the `make_current` parameter is checked. It appears that the `make_current` parameter is meant to be a boolean flag that determines whether the IOLoop should be made the current IOLoop. 

In the provided buggy function, the error occurs because when `make_current` is `True`, it first checks if the current IOLoop does not exist and then tries to make it the current IOLoop. However, if the current IOLoop does exist, it raises a `RuntimeError`. 

To fix this, we need to remove the check for the current IOLoop if `make_current` is `True`, and directly call `self.make_current()` without checking for the existence of the current IOLoop.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/tornado_14/tornado/ioloop.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def current(instance=True):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def make_current(self):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# corrected function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
``` 

With this correction, the `initialize` function will correctly check if the current IOLoop does not exist before making it the current IOLoop, and it will no longer raise a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True`.
