Potential Error Location: The if-elif-else conditions inside the initialize method are likely causing the issue.

Reasons behind the Bug:
- The if-elif-else conditions are not logically consistent.
- The code is using both None and make_current to check the status of IOLoop.current, which can lead to confusion and potential bugs.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
- Simplify the conditions and make them logically consistent.
- Use only one method to check the status of IOLoop.current for better clarity and maintainability.

Corrected Code:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    if make_current:
        self.make_current()
```
