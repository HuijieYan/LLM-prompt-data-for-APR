The potential error in the `initialize` function is with the `self.make_current()` line. The function is trying to call `make_current` on the instance (`self`), but it is not defined within the class.

The reason behind the bug is that `make_current` is assumed to be a method of the class instance, but it's actually not defined within the class.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the `self` prefix from `make_current` and directly call the `make_current` function. If `make_current` is a method defined within the class, then we need to make sure it is properly defined and accessible.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        make_current()
```
