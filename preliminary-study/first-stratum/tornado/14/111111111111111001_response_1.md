The error occurs when the test case tries to initialize a new IOLoop with `make_current=True`. The error message states that a RuntimeError is raised because "current IOLoop already exists".

The bug is located in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The conditional statements inside the `initialize` method are not correctly handling the `make_current` argument.

The reason behind the bug is that when `make_current` is set to True, it should check if there is already a current IOLoop instance. If it exists, it should not try to make the current IOLoop, and instead raise a RuntimeError.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statements inside the `initialize` method to handle the `make_current` argument properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... previous code ...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            else:
                self.make_current()
```

With this correction, when `make_current` is set to True, it will first check if a current IOLoop instance exists. If it does, it will raise a RuntimeError. Otherwise, it will make the current IOLoop instance.

This change ensures that the `make_current` argument is handled correctly and addresses the RuntimeError observed in the test case.
