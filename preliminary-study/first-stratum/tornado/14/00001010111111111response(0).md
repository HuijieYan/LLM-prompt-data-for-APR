The issue seems to be with the conditional logic in the `initialize` function. The function is supposed to check if the IOLoop is already created and make it the current IOLoop if it isn't. If the `make_current` parameter is provided as `True`, it is also supposed to check if the current IOLoop already exists and raise an error if it does.

The error message indicates that the RuntimeError is being raised when `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop already exists. This means that the logic inside the `initialize` function is not working as intended.

To fix the bug, the conditional statements in the `initialize` function need to be adjusted to properly handle the cases where `make_current` is `None` or `True`.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this adjusted code:
- We store the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in the `current` variable to avoid calling the method multiple times.
- In the first condition, if `make_current` is `None`, we check if the current IOLoop doesn't exist and then call `self.make_current()` to make the current IOLoop.
- In the second condition, if `make_current` is `True`, we check if the current IOLoop already exists and raise a RuntimeError if it does. Otherwise, we call `self.make_current()`.

This should address the issues with the original code and make the `initialize` function work as intended.
