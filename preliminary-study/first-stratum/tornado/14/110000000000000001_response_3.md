Potential Error Location:
The potential error location in the code is the condition `if make_current is None`. It seems that the intention is to check if `make_current` is not provided and then call `self.make_current()`. However, the logic is incorrect and can lead to unexpected behavior.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug occurs because the logic to check if `make_current` is not provided is incorrect. The intention is to call `self.make_current()` when `make_current` is not provided, but the condition is checking for None instead of not being provided.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we can change the condition to check if `make_current` is not provided. We can achieve this by checking if `make_current` is equal to the default value of None and then call `self.make_current()`. Additionally, we can remove the redundant check for `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` as it is already being checked within the condition.

Corrected Code:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
