The potential error location within the `initialize` function is the conditional statement that checks if `make_current` is True and if the current IOLoop instance is None. The bug occurs because the `initialize` function is not implementing the logic correctly.

The bug occurs because the conditional statement does not consider the case where `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop instance is not None, which should also be handled.

To fix the bug, we can modify the conditional statement to check both the cases where `make_current` is None and `make_current` is True, and the current IOLoop instance is either None or not None.

Here is the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this modification, the `initialize` function will correctly handle the cases when `make_current` is None and when it is True, ensuring that the current IOLoop instance is managed appropriately.
