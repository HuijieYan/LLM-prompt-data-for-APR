The issue seems to be with the logic in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The method is supposed to initialize the `IOLoop` object and set it as the current `IOLoop`, but there seems to be a bug in the logic related to the `make_current` parameter.

The bug occurs when `make_current` is set to `True` and there is no current `IOLoop` instance. Instead of setting the current `IOLoop` and initializing it, it raises a `RuntimeError` claiming that the current `IOLoop` already exists, which is contradictory and incorrect.

The logic in the `initialize` method should be modified to handle the `make_current` parameter properly based on whether a current `IOLoop` instance exists or not.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to modify the logic inside the `initialize` method to check if there is a current `IOLoop` instance before attempting to set the new `IOLoop` as current. If there is no current instance and `make_current` is set to `True`, then the new `IOLoop` should be set as the current one. If there is already a current instance and `make_current` is set to `True`, then it should raise a `RuntimeError`.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` method will handle the `make_current` parameter correctly and avoid raising the incorrect `RuntimeError`.
