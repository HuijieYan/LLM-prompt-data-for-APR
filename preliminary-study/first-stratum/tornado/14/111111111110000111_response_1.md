Potential Error Location:
The issue seems to be in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class, specifically in the conditional check when `make_current` is True.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because even if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns None, the code still raises a RuntimeError indicating that the current IOLoop already exists. This is contradictory to the condition and causes the test case to fail.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
We can fix this bug by modifying the conditional check for create_current. If `make_current` is True and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None, then we should raise the RuntimeError. If `make_current` is True and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, then we can proceed with making the `IOLoop` current. 

Corrected Code:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            # Check if IOLoop.current returns None
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            # If it returns None, make the IOLoop current
            self.make_current()
```

With this modification, the code will check whether an IOLoop instance already exists before attempting to make the IOLoop current. If an instance already exists and `make_current` is True, it will raise a RuntimeError. If no instance exists and `make_current` is True, it will make the IOLoop current.
