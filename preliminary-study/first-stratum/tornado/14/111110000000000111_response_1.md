The potential error location within the `initialize` function is the conditional statement that checks if `make_current` is `None`. 

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the conditional statement does not handle the case where `make_current` is `False`. This results in the function not behaving as expected and potentially raising a `RuntimeError` when it shouldn't.

To fix the bug, we need to add a conditional check for when `make_current` is `False`, and modify the existing conditional statements to handle all cases properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    else:  # Handle case when make_current is False
        pass  # Do nothing when make_current is False
```

By adding the `else` block to handle the case when `make_current` is `False`, we ensure that the function behaves as expected for all possible values of `make_current`.
