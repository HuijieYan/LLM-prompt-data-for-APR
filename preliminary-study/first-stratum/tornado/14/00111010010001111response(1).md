The issue occurs in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The logic is intended to check if `make_current` is `True` and if the current `IOLoop` instance exists, raise a `RuntimeError`. However, the logic is faulty as it only checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` before raising the error.

To fix this issue, the logic in the `initialize` method needs to be updated to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter. The condition to check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists should be reversed, and the `RuntimeError` should only be raised if `make_current` is `True` and there is an existing current `IOLoop` instance.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this change, the `initialize` method should now correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and raise a `RuntimeError` only if needed.
