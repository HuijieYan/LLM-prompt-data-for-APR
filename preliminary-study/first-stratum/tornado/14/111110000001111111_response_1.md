The issue with the `initialize` function is that it checks if the current IOLoop exists and then tries to make it current, but it doesn't handle the case when the current IOLoop already exists. This results in raising a RuntimeError even if the current IOLoop exists.

To fix this issue, the function should be modified to only call `make_current` if there is no current IOLoop, and if `make_current` is set to True. If `make_current` is set to True and there is already a current IOLoop, then it should raise a RuntimeError.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("Current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected code, the function will now only try to make the IOLoop current if there is no current IOLoop and `make_current` is set to True. If `make_current` is set to True and there is already a current IOLoop, it will raise a RuntimeError as intended.
