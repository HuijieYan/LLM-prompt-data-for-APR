The error message indicates that the "current IOLoop already exists" RuntimeError is being raised when the `make_current` parameter is set to True. This means that the check for the existing IOLoop is not working correctly.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the conditional statements that check for the existence of the current IOLoop and the value of the `make_current` parameter.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the conditional statements are not properly handling the cases where `make_current` is None or True.

To fix the bug, we can modify the conditional statements to properly handle the cases where `make_current` is None or True.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=False):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```
