The issue here seems to be in the `initialize` function. The code is checking if `make_current` is None, and if so, it calls `self.make_current()`. However, when `make_current` is not None, it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None and then raises an error if it is not None.

The issue here is that if `make_current` is not None and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None, it will raise an error even though it should not. This is because the intent of the code seems to be to check if `make_current` is true, and if so, call `self.make_current()` without checking if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None or not.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `initialize` function by removing the check for `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` and simply call `self.make_current()` when `make_current` is true.

Here is the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the `initialize` function will correctly call `self.make_current()` when `make_current` is True without unnecessarily checking if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None or not.
