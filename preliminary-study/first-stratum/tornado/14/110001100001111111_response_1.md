Potential error location:
The issue seems to be in the `initialize` method, specifically in the conditional statements for `make_current`. When `make_current` is not provided and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, the `self.make_current()` method should be called. However, in the `elif` block, it seems to be checking the same condition again, which may lead to the "current IOLoop already exists" error being raised.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because of the incorrect conditional logic. In the `initialize` method, when `make_current` is not provided, the condition to check if the current IOLoop instance is None is correct. But in the `elif` block, it checks the same condition again without considering the previous condition.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the conditional logic needs to be adjusted. The `elif` block should only be executed if `make_current` is provided and its value is True, and it should not re-check the condition for the current IOLoop instance.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
