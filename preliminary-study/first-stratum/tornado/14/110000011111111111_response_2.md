The bug seems to be related to the `initialize` method of the `KQueueIOLoop` class. The bug occurs because the logic for checking whether an IOLoop is already current is incorrect. When `make_current` is `True`, it wrongly raises a `RuntimeError` even though `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is actually `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic inside the `initialize` method to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the method now correctly checks whether an IOLoop is already current when `make_current` is `True` and raises a `RuntimeError` only if an IOLoop is already current.

This fix should address the bug and prevent the incorrect `RuntimeError` from being raised when `make_current` is provided as `True`.
