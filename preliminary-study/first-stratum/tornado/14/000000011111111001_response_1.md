The problem occurs in the `initialize` method of the `KQueueIOLoop` class. When the `make_current` parameter is `True`, the method checks if the current IOLoop exists, and if it does not, it raises a `RuntimeError`. However, the condition to check if the current IOLoop exists is inverted, leading to the incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to invert the condition for checking the existence of the current IOLoop. If the current IOLoop exists and `make_current` is `True`, it should raise a `RuntimeError`, indicating that the current IOLoop already exists.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this fixed code, the conditional checking is properly inverted, and the `RuntimeError` will be raised if the current IOLoop exists and `make_current` is `True`, as expected.
