The test case `test_force_current` is trying to create an instance of `IOLoop` with the parameter `make_current` set to `True`. It then checks if this instance is the current instance using `IOLoop.current()`. If another instance with `make_current=True` is created, it should raise a `RuntimeError`. However, the current behavior is that it does not recognize the existing instance and tries to create a new one.

The potential error location within the `initialize` method is in the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter. The issue is that the function does not correctly check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists with the same `make_current` setting.

The reason for the bug is that the logic within the function does not consider the scenario when an `IOLoop` instance already exists with the `make_current` setting as `True`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic within the `initialize` method to correctly check for the existence of an `IOLoop` instance with the same `make_current` setting. If it already exists and `make_current` is `True`, it should raise a `RuntimeError` as per the test case.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current:
            current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
            if current_instance is not None and current_instance.make_current:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists with make_current=True")
            self.make_current()
```

This correction ensures that when `make_current` is `True`, it checks if an `IOLoop` instance already exists with the same setting and raises a `RuntimeError` if it does.
