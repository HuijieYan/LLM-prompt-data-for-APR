The problem seems to lie in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The method is supposed to check if an instance of `IOLoop` is already the current instance, and raise a `RuntimeError` if so. However, the current implementation does not handle the case where the `IOLoop` instance is not the current one, but `make_current` is set to `True`.

The error message from the test function indicates that it is trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, but a `RuntimeError` is raised because it seems that an `IOLoop` instance is already the current one.

To fix this, the `initialize` method should be modified to properly handle the case where `make_current` is set to `True` and an `IOLoop` instance already exists as the current one.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

In this corrected code, we first check if `make_current` is `True`, and if so, we verify that there is no current instance of `IOLoop`. If there is a current instance, we raise a `RuntimeError`. If there is no current instance, we make the current instance. If `make_current` is `False`, we simply check if there is no current instance and make it the current one. This implementation should address the issue and handle both cases correctly.
