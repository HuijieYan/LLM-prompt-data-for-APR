Potential error location:
The issue is with the conditional check for `make_current`. The function should only call `self.make_current()` if `make_current` is True and there is no current IOLoop instance. 

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the conditional checks in the `initialize` function are not correctly handling the `make_current` parameter.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if `make_current` is True and there is no current IOLoop instance, then call `self.make_current()`.
2. If `make_current` is None, check if there is no current IOLoop instance, then call `self.make_current()`.
3. If `make_current` is True and there is already a current IOLoop instance, raise a RuntimeError.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None and current_ioloop is None:
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current and current_ioloop is None:
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current and current_ioloop is not None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```
