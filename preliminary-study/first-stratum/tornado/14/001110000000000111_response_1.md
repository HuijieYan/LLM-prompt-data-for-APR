The issue seems to be in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The code checks if `make_current` is None and then checks if the current instance of IOLoop is None. If it is, then it calls the `make_current` method. If `make_current` is not None, it again checks if the current instance of IOLoop is None and raises a RuntimeError if it's not. This seems to be redundant and the logic is not clear.

The bug occurs because the code is trying to check if the current instance of IOLoop exists in two different ways, and the handling of these checks is not consistent.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` method should be modified to handle the logic more clearly. It should check if `make_current` is True and the current instance of IOLoop is not None, then it should raise a RuntimeError. If `make_current` is not True, then it should just call the `make_current` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    else:
        self.make_current()
```

This code first checks if `make_current` is True and the current instance of IOLoop is not None, then it raises a RuntimeError. If `make_current` is not True, it calls the `make_current` method. This logic is more clear and should address the bug.
