The error occurs in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The `initialize` method checks if a current `IOLoop` instance exists and if not, it makes the current `IOLoop` instance. However, the logic is flawed, leading to the incorrect behavior.

The bug occurs because the code is checking if a current `IOLoop` instance exists using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. If it doesn't exist, it then tries to make the current `IOLoop` instance. However, in the case where `make_current` is `True`, it should directly make the current `IOLoop` instance without checking if it already exists, and raise an error only if it does exist.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` method should be modified to directly make the current `IOLoop` instance if `make_current` is `True`, and then check if it already exists and raise an error if it does.

Below is the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("Current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is None and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected code, the `initialize` method will correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and ensure the appropriate behavior based on its value.
