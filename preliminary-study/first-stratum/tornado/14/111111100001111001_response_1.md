The error is occurring when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`, and the `IOLoop.current` instance already exists. The bug seems to be in the `initialize` method, where it should only raise an error if `make_current` is `True` and there is already an existing current instance. However, the code is currently checking for the existence of the current instance even when `make_current` is `None`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` method to only check for the existence of the current instance when `make_current` is set to `True`.

Here is the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this modification, the code will only check for the existence of the current instance when `make_current` is `True`, and it will raise an error if the current instance already exists.
