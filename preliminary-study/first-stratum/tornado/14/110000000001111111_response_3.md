The problem with the given code is that the `initialize` function is checking if `make_current` is None or True, and then trying to make the current IOLoop instance if it is None or raising an error if it already exists. The issue arises in the logic where it tries to check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance.

It seems like the intention is to check if `make_current` is True, then we need to make the current IOLoop instance. If it is None, then we should also make the current IOLoop instance if it doesn't exist.

The bug occurs because the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is being checked separately within each of the if-else blocks, causing the function to incorrectly handle the logic.

To fix the bug, we can modify the code to first check if `make_current` is True or if it is None, and then perform the action accordingly. We only need to check the existence of the current IOLoop instance once.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

With this modification, the code will first check if `make_current` is True or None, and then it will check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance and perform the necessary action based on the combined conditions.
