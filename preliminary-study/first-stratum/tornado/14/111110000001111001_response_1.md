The bug in the `initialize` function seems to be related to the condition checking for the `make_current` parameter. When `make_current` is True, the code is trying to check if the current IOLoop exists but it should not raise an error if it exists. 

The function is meant to initialize the IOLoop and optionally make it the current IOLoop. If `make_current` is not provided, it should only make the IOLoop current if there is no current IOLoop. If `make_current` is True, it should make the IOLoop current, and if there is already a current IOLoop, it should raise an error.

The bug occurs because when `make_current` is True, it checks if the current IOLoop exists and tries to make it current if it doesn't, which is unnecessary. Instead, it should only check if the current IOLoop exists and raise an error if it does when `make_current` is True.

To fix the bug, we need to update the condition for `make_current`. Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

This fixes the bug by checking if the current IOLoop exists and raising an error if it does when `make_current` is True.
