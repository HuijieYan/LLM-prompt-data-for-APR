The bug is in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. This method checks if the current IOLoop already exists or not, and based on that, it either makes the current IOLoop or raises an error. 

The issue arises from the fact that the code first checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, and if it is, it then tries to make the current IOLoop. However, if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None at the initial check, the code does not handle this case properly and directly raises an error, assuming that the current IOLoop already exists. 

To fix this bug, we should change the condition where the error is raised to check if `make_current` is False, and if so, it should not try to make the current IOLoop.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Fix: Changed the condition to check if current IOLoop exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the code will check if the current IOLoop exists and only raise an error if `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop already exists.
