The error occurs in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. Specifically, the issue is with the conditional statements in the `initialize` method. The `initialize` method is supposed to initialize the IOLoop and handle the `make_current` parameter. 

The bug occurs because of the conditional check in the `initialize` method. When `make_current` is not provided, it checks if the current IOLoop instance is None, and if so, it calls the `make_current` method. However, when `make_current` is explicitly set to True, it checks if the current IOLoop instance is None and then raises an error, even though it should proceed to make the current IOLoop instance.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the conditional checks in the `initialize` method to ensure that the correct logic is applied for handling the `make_current` parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:  # Handles both make_current=None and make_current=True cases
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected code, we first handle the case when `make_current` is not provided. Then, we handle the scenario when `make_current` is explicitly set to True. We check if the current IOLoop instance exists, and if it does, we raise an error. If not, we proceed to make the current IOLoop instance. This ensures that the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter is properly implemented.
