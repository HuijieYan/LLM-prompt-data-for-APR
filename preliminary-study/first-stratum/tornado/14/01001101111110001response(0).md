The issue with the `initialize` function is that it is not using the correct references to the `current` and `make_current` functions. It is also not correctly handling the `make_current` parameter.

To fix this issue, we need to properly reference the `current` and `make_current` functions from the `IOLoop` class, and handle the `make_current` parameter appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected code, we are using `self.current` and `self.make_current` to reference the functions within the `IOLoop` class. Additionally, we are using `self` instead of `IOLoop` to access these functions, making sure that we are working with the instance of the class.

These changes should address the issues with the original `initialize` function and help it behave as intended.

Additionally, the test case provided for the `force_current` method of the `IOLoop` class should work correctly with this corrected code.
