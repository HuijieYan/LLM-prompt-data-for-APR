The test case `test_force_current` is trying to initialize an `IOLoop` object with `make_current=True`, and then it checks if it is the current `IOLoop` using `IOLoop.current()`. If it fails, it expects a `RuntimeError` to be raised when trying to initialize a second `IOLoop` object with `make_current=True`. The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError` is not being raised as expected, suggesting a problem with the `initialize` function.

The potential error location within the `initialize` function is the condition `elif make_current`, where it should raise a `RuntimeError` if the current `IOLoop` already exists.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the condition `elif make_current` is not correctly handling the case when `make_current=True` and the current `IOLoop` already exists. Instead, it is only checking if the current `IOLoop` does not exist and then making it the current one.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition `elif make_current` to raise a `RuntimeError` when the current `IOLoop` already exists.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the `initialize` function will correctly handle the case when `make_current=True` and the current `IOLoop` already exists. This should resolve the issue observed in the test case.
