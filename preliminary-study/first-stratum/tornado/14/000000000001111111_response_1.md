Potential Error Location:
The potential error lies in the conditional statement:
```python
if make_current is None:
    if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        self.make_current()
```
and
```python
elif make_current:
    if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    self.make_current()
```

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
In the given buggy code, the conditional statement for `make_current` does not handle all possible cases. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is checked inside both `if` and `elif` blocks, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional statements to handle all possible cases. Additionally, we need to account for both `make_current is None` and `make_current is not None` cases.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
In the corrected code:
- The `if` condition checks if `make_current` is `None` and creates a new current IOLoop if it doesn't already exist.
- The `else` block handles both the cases when `make_current` is `True` and when it is `False`, and also checks for the existence of the current IOLoop before taking any action.
