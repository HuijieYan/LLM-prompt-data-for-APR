The bug is in the `initialize` function. The `initialize` function is trying to check if the current `IOLoop` instance is None and then make it current, but the logic for checking if the current `IOLoop` instance is None is incorrect.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` is always true, so it goes into the `if` block and tries to make the current IOLoop instance, resulting in the "already exists" error because the current IOLoop instance is already not None.

To fix this bug, the condition should be checking if the `IOLoop` instance is not None, and if it is not None, then raise the RuntimeError.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function will first check if the current `IOLoop` instance is not None and only then proceed to make it current. If `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`, it will also check if the current `IOLoop` instance is not None before raising the RuntimeError.
