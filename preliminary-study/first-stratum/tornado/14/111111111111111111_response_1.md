The issue occurs in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The problem is that when `make_current` is set to `True`, it checks if there is a current `IOLoop` instance using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` and raises a RuntimeError if an instance is found. However, the code is contradictory as it should not raise an error if an instance exists when `make_current=True`.

To fix this issue, we can modify the code to only attempt to make the current `IOLoop` instance if `make_current` is explicitly set to `True` and no `IOLoop` instance exists. If `make_current` is not explicitly set, it should still try to make the current instance if one does not already exist.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        self.make_current()  # Always try to make this instance current
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This way, the code will attempt to make the current `IOLoop` instance only when `make_current` is explicitly set to `True` and no instance exists. Otherwise, it will always try to make the current instance by default.
