The error occurs in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. When the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`, it checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance using the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` call. If it exists, it raises a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists".

The issue here is that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is used to check if a current `IOLoop` instance is present, but the subsequent condition `elif make_current` does not check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists or not. It directly proceeds to check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, and raises an error even if it's not None.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the conditions within the `initialize` method to handle the cases where `make_current` is `True` and a current `IOLoop` instance exists.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this modified code, when `make_current` is `True`, it first checks if a current `IOLoop` instance exists. If it does, it raises a `RuntimeError`. If no current instance exists, it proceeds to make the current `IOLoop`.

The issue was related to incorrect condition checking that didn't properly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and a current `IOLoop` instance exists. By correcting the condition, we ensure that the logic accurately checks for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance before making it the current one.
