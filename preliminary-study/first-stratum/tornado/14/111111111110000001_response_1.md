The test case `test_force_current` is trying to create an `IOLoop` instance with the `make_current` parameter set to `True`. The test then checks if the `IOLoop.current()` is the same as the created instance, and if there is a `RuntimeError` when creating another `IOLoop` instance with `make_current` set to `True`.

The error message indicates that the RuntimeError is being raised when attempting to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`. This happens because the `initialize` method within the `IOLoop` class tries to ensure that only one `IOLoop` instance can be marked as current.

The bug occurs because the check for an existing current `IOLoop` instance is incorrect, leading to the RuntimeError being raised erroneously.

To fix this, we can modify the `initialize` method to correctly check for an existing current `IOLoop` instance and only raise a RuntimeError if `make_current=True` and a current instance already exists.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` method correctly handles the `make_current` parameter and checks for existing current instances before raising a RuntimeError.
