Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the `initialize` function where the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter is incorrect.

Reason for the bug: The `initialize` function incorrectly checks if the IOLoop is already set as the current IOLoop when `make_current=True`. If it is not set, it should set the current IOLoop using `self.make_current()`. However, the current logic does not handle this case properly and results in the RuntimeError being raised unnecessarily.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: We can fix the bug by updating the conditional statements in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the cases where `make_current` is `None` or `True`.

Corrected code:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
