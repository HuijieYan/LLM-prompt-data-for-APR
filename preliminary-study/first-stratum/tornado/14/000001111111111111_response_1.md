The issue is occurring because of the incorrect use of the `make_current` parameter in the `initialize` method of the `KQueueIOLoop` class. The code is checking for the current IOLoop instance using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` and then trying to make the current IOLoop using `self.make_current()`. However, there seems to be confusion in the logic related to making the current IOLoop.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` method and correct the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected code, we first check if `make_current` is True. If it is, then we check if the current IOLoop instance already exists and raise a RuntimeError if it does. On the other hand, if `make_current` is False or None, we check if the current IOLoop instance does not exist, and then we call `self.make_current()` to make the current IOLoop.

With this correction, the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter is fixed and the issue should be resolved.
