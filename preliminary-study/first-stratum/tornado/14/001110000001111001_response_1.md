Potential Error Location:
The bug seems to be occurring in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `initialize` method is not handling the scenario where `make_current` is True and the current `IOLoop` already exists. It only checks if the current `IOLoop` exists when `make_current` is None or False.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to check if `make_current` is True and the current `IOLoop` already exists. If it does, then we need to raise a RuntimeError as specified in the requirement.

Corrected Code:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current IOLoop already exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
In the corrected code, an additional condition is added to check if `make_current` is True and the current `IOLoop` already exists. If it does, then a RuntimeError is raised. This should fix the bug in the `initialize` method.
