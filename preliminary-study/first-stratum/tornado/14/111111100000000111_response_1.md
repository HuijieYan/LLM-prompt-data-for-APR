The bug is in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. 

The problem occurs because the `initialize` method first checks if `make_current` is None and then proceeds to check whether the current `IOLoop` instance is None or not. If it is None, then it calls the `make_current` method to make the current `IOLoop` instance.

However, if `make_current` is not None and it is True, the method again checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is None, and if it is not None, it raises a RuntimeError. This is contradictory and causes the bug.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the second check for `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` when `make_current` is True.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected code, when `make_current` is True, it only checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is not None, and if it is not None, it raises a RuntimeError.
