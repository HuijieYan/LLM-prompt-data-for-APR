1. The test case "test_force_current" is trying to create an IOLoop instance with the "make_current" parameter set to True. It then checks if the created instance is the current instance using the "IOLoop.current()" method. It also checks if attempting to create another instance with "make_current" set to True raises a RuntimeError, as expected.

2. The potential error location is within the "initialize" method of the IOLoop class, specifically in the logic related to handling the "make_current" parameter.

3. The error occurs because the logic for handling the "make_current" parameter in the "initialize" method is not correctly identifying whether a current IOLoop instance already exists. It is also not setting the current IOLoop instance correctly.

4. To fix the bug, we need to update the "initialize" method to properly handle the "make_current" parameter and ensure that the current IOLoop instance is set correctly.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class IOLoop:
    @staticmethod
    def current(instance=True):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def make_current(self):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is not None and make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("Current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
```

In the corrected code, I've added a check for "make_current is not None and make_current" to ensure that the provided "make_current" parameter is explicitly set to True before attempting to make the current IOLoop instance. I've also corrected the condition for checking if the current IOLoop instance already exists before attempting to make it. Finally, in the "elif" block, I've updated the condition to correctly handle the case when "make_current" is None.
