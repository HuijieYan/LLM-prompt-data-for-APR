The bug seems to be in the `initialize` method of the `KQueueIOLoop` class, where the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter is flawed. The bug occurs because the function is not correctly checking whether an IOLoop instance already exists before attempting to create a new one.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` method to properly handle the `make_current` parameter and check whether an IOLoop instance already exists. We can do this by using the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` method to check for the existence of a current IOLoop instance.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected code properly handles the `make_current` parameter and checks for the existence of a current IOLoop instance before attempting to create a new one.
