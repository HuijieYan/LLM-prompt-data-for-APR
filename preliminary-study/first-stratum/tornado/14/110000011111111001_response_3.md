The error message from the test function indicates that the "current IOLoop already exists" error is being raised, meaning that the current IOLoop instance already exists when trying to initialize a new one with make_current=True.

The potential error in the problematic function is in the logic of handling the make_current parameter. The current logic does not properly handle the case when make_current is True and an IOLoop instance already exists.

The reason behind the bug is that the conditional statements in the initialize method do not cover all possible cases when make_current is provided. It does not check if make_current is True and an IOLoop instance already exists.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to check if make_current is True and if IOLoop.current() is not None, and then raise an error. If make_current is None, the method should check if an IOLoop instance exists and create one if it doesn't.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the initialize method now properly handles the make_current parameter and raises an error if a current IOLoop instance already exists when trying to initialize a new one with make_current=True.
