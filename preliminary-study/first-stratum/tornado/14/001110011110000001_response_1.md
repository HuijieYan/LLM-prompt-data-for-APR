The buggy function is the `initialize` method in the `IOLoop` class. The error message from the test function indicates that the error is occurring at the point where `make_current` is set to True in the `initialize` method.

The bug seems to be that when `make_current` is True, the code is raising a `RuntimeError` if the current `IOLoop` instance is already set. This is contradictory to the intended behavior of setting the current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is True.

The code should not raise an error if `make_current` is True and the current `IOLoop` instance is already set. Instead, it should set the current `IOLoop` instance. 

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic in the `initialize` method to handle the case when `make_current` is True and the current `IOLoop` instance is already set. We can avoid raising the `RuntimeError` and simply make the current `IOLoop` instance.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            return  # No need to do anything if the current instance already exists
        self.make_current()
```
