1. The test case `test_force_current` is trying to create an `IOLoop` object with `make_current=True` and then attempting to create another `IOLoop` object with the same parameter. The expected behavior is that the first `IOLoop` object should be the current one, and the second creation attempt should raise a `RuntimeError`.

2. The potential error location is within the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class, specifically in the `if make_current is None` and `elif make_current` branches.

3. The bug occurs because the logic in the `initialize` method does not accurately handle the case when `make_current=None`. The code checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`, and if so, it calls `make_current()`. However, it also tries to handle the case where `make_current=True`, which leads to the incorrect behavior and the `RuntimeError` being raised.

4. To fix the bug, we should only check if `make_current` is `None` and, in that case, ensure that the current `IOLoop` instance is set using the `make_current()` method. If `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`, it should raise a `RuntimeError` if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists. We can remove the `elif make_current` branch to simplify the logic.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By simplifying the logic and handling the `make_current` parameter correctly, we can ensure that the `IOLoop` object is initialized as expected.
