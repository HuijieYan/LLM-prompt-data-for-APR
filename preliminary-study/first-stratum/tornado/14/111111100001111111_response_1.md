The issue arises from the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The `initialize` method is intended to initialize the IOLoop and make it the current IOLoop if `make_current` is set to `True`. However, the issue arises when the `make_current` argument is set to `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`. In this case, the code raises a `RuntimeError` stating that the current IOLoop already exists, which is incorrect.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition where the `RuntimeError` is being raised. Instead of raising a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop is `None`, we should simply make the IOLoop the current IOLoop in this case.

Here is the corrected code for the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            self.make_current()
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

With this modification, when `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop is `None`, the IOLoop will be made the current IOLoop instead of raising a `RuntimeError`.
