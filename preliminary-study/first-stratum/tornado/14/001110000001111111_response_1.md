The issue seems to be occurring in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class. The function checks if `make_current` is None, and if so, it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is None, and if it is, it calls the `make_current` method. If `make_current` is not None, it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is None and if it is not, it raises a RuntimeError. 

The bug occurs because in the second case, when `make_current` is True, it first checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is None (which shouldn't be the case if `make_current` is True), and then raises a RuntimeError. This logic is contradictory and causes the bug.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the check for `None` when `make_current` is True and instead directly call `self.make_current()`.

Here is the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
