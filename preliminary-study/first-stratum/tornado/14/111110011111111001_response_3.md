The error message suggests that the 'make_current' attribute is not being properly handled within the 'initialize' function of the 'IOLoop' class. The error occurs when trying to make the current IOLoop while one already exists.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statement that checks whether the current IOLoop instance already exists when 'make_current' is set to True.

The bug occurs because the conditional statement is mistakenly checking for the existence of the current IOLoop instance when it should be checking for its non-existence. This causes the RuntimeError to be raised when 'make_current' is set to True, even if there is no current IOLoop instance.

To fix the bug, the conditional statement should be inverted. It should check for the non-existence of the current IOLoop instance when 'make_current' is True and raise a RuntimeError only if an instance already exists.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
