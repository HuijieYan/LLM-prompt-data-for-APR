The potential error in the provided function is that it doesn't seem to define the `make_current` method or attribute anywhere. This is likely causing the error.

To fix this, we can modify the function to use the `make_current` method or attribute directly, assuming it exists in the containing class.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if getattr(self, 'make_current', None) is not None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if getattr(self, 'make_current', None) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
