The issue is with the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The problem lies in the logic for checking the current instance of the `IOLoop`.

The existing code checks whether the `IOLoop.current` is `None` or not, and then proceeds to either make the current instance or raise an error if the current instance already exists.

The issue is with the logic in the `initialize` method where it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` and then decides whether to make the current instance or raise an error. The logic is flawed because it doesn't check the value of `make_current` parameter properly, and the condition for raising an error is not valid.

To fix the bug, the code should be refactored as follows:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=True):
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected code, we first check if `make_current` is `True`. If it is, then we check if the current instance already exists using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. If it exists, we raise an error. If it doesn't exist, we make it the current instance.

This fix ensures that the logic for checking and setting the current instance is correctly implemented, and it resolves the issue described in the bug report.
