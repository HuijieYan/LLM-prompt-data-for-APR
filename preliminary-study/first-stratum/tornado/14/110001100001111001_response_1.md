Potential error location:
The potential error is occurring in the `initialize` method where it checks for the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`. 

Reason behind the bug:
The `initialize` method is checking if the current IOLoop exists without providing the instance argument, which is causing the error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Since the `make_current` method is defined with `self` as a parameter, it should be called using the instance `self.make_current()` instead of directly calling `make_current()`.
2. It seems like the `make_current` method should be called if `make_current` parameter is `True` and the IOLoop instance is not already created.

Corrected code:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
