Potential error location: The error is occurring in the `initialize` function where the `make_current` parameter is being used.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the `make_current` parameter is not being used correctly. The intention seems to be to call the `make_current` method if `make_current` is true or if it is None and the current IOLoop instance does not exist. However, the usage of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is incorrect and should instead call the `current` method from the IOLoop class.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use the correct method and parameters to check for the current IOLoop instance and make it current if it does not exist.
2. Remove the unnecessary `instance` parameter from the `current` method.

Corrected code:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current() is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current() is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
