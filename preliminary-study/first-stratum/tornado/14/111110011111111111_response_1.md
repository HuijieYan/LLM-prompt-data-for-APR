The bug here is occurring because the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class is not handling the `make_current` parameter correctly. The bug is identified due to the error message `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists` being raised when trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`.

The issue occurs because in the `initialize` method, when `make_current` is set to True and there is no existing current `IOLoop`, it should make the current `IOLoop` instance. However, when there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and `make_current` is set to True, it should raise an error. Currently, it is raising an error when there is no current `IOLoop` instance, regardless of the value of `make_current`.

To fix this issue, the `initialize` method needs to be modified to handle the `make_current` parameter correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected code, if `make_current` is True and there is already a current `IOLoop`, it will raise an error. Otherwise, it will make the current `IOLoop` as expected.

This should resolve the bug and ensure that the `initialize` method handles the `make_current` parameter correctly.
