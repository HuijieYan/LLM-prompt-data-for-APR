The test case `test_force_current` is trying to create an `IOLoop` with `make_current=True`. The expected behavior is that if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, it should raise a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists". However, the buggy function is not behaving as expected and is raising the `RuntimeError` even when there is no current `IOLoop` instance.

The potential error location is within the `initialize` method at line 252 in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file.

The bug is occurring because the logic in the `initialize` method is not correctly checking whether a current `IOLoop` instance exists or not. When `make_current=True` and there is no current `IOLoop` instance, it should make the current `IOLoop`. If `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, it should raise a `RuntimeError`.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` method should be updated to verify the current `IOLoop` instance correctly and handle the `make_current` parameter as per the expected behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

This modification ensures that when `make_current=True`, it checks if there is a current `IOLoop` instance. If there is, it raises a `RuntimeError`. If not, it makes the current `IOLoop`.
