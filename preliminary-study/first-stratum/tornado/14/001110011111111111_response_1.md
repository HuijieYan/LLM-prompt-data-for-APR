The error occurs in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The issue is that if `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance exists, it should raise an error. However, currently, it is raising an error if `make_current` is `True` and no current `IOLoop` instance exists.

To fix this bug, the conditional statement inside the `initialize` method needs to be adjusted. Specifically, the logic to check if a current `IOLoop` instance exists needs to be inverted for the case when `make_current` is `True`.

The corrected code for the `initialize` method is as follows:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    # If make_current is None, try to make this instance the current IOLoop if no current instance exists
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    # If make_current is True, raise an error if a current IOLoop instance already exists
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected code, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` is added to raise an error if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists when `make_current` is `True`. This addresses the issue by ensuring that the error is only raised when it should be based on the `make_current` flag.
