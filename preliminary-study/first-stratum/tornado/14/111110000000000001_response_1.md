The potential error location within the `initialize` function is in the condition where it checks if `make_current` is None. If it is, it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, and if it is, it calls `self.make_current()`. However, there is a missing self reference while calling the function `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`, and there is also a missing `self` parameter for the `make_current` function.

The bug occurs because the `initialize` function is not properly referencing the `current` and `make_current` functions within the class. Additionally, the function `make_current` should have a `self` parameter, as it is a method of the class. 

To fix this bug, the `initialize` function needs to call the `IOLoop.current` and `make_current` functions properly by passing `self` as a parameter. Additionally, the `make_current` function should have a `self` parameter in its signature.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
