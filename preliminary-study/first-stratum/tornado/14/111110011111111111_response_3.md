The test case "test_force_current" is trying to create an instance of the IOLoop class with `make_current=True` and then verify that it becomes the current IOLoop. It then tries to create another instance with `make_current=True`, which should raise a `RuntimeError` because the current IOLoop already exists. The error message indicates that the RuntimeError is being raised even though `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None.

The potential error location is in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class, specifically in the conditional checks related to `make_current`.

The bug occurs because the conditional checks in the `initialize` method are not handling the case where `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop already exists correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional checks in the `initialize` method to correctly handle the case where `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop already exists.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This fix ensures that the `initialize` method correctly checks whether the current IOLoop already exists when `make_current` is True and raises a `RuntimeError` accordingly.
