Potential Error location: 
The error is occurring in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The issue seems to be related to the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the `initialize` method is not handling the `make_current` parameter correctly. In the provided code, the logic for checking whether the current `IOLoop` exists is flawed, leading to the RuntimeError being raised erroneously.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
The `initialize` method should properly handle the `make_current` parameter and check if the current `IOLoop` already exists before attempting to make it the current `IOLoop`. Additionally, the logic for raising a RuntimeError should also be revised to ensure that it is only raised when necessary.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected code, I have modified the conditional statement in the `initialize` method to properly handle the `make_current` parameter. I also revised the logic for checking if the current `IOLoop` exists before attempting to make it the current `IOLoop. This should resolve the bug and prevent the RuntimeError from being raised erroneously.
