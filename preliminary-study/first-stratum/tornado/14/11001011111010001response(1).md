The problem in the code is that the initialize function is not properly checking the condition for `make_current`. It should only call `self.make_current()` when `make_current` is True, and should raise a `RuntimeError` if it is already initialized.

Here is the corrected code for the initialize function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

In this corrected code, it properly checks for the condition when `make_current` is True and handles the `RuntimeError` if the IOLoop is already initialized.
