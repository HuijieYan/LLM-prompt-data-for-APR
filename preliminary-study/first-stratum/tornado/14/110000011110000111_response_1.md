The error occurs when the `make_current` argument is set to True, and the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None, which means that a current IOLoop instance already exists. However, the `if` condition inside the `initialize` function mistakenly checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None.

To fix this bug, we need to change the condition for checking if a current IOLoop instance already exists. The if-elif-else construct can be improved for better readability and to ensure that the correct conditions are being checked.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)

    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected code:
1. We store the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in the variable `current_ioloop` to avoid redundant calls to the `IOLoop.current` method.
2. We then check if `make_current` is None and if `current_ioloop` is None, in which case we call `self.make_current()`.
3. If `make_current` is True, we check if `current_ioloop` is not None, and if so, raise a `RuntimeError`. Otherwise, we call `self.make_current()`.

This fix ensures that the correct conditions are being checked to determine whether a current IOLoop instance already exists or not.
