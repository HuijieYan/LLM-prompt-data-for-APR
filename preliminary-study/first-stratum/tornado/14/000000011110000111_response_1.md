The test case "test_force_current" is trying to create a new IOLoop instance with make_current set to True. It expects that if an IOLoop is already marked as current, then creating a new one with make_current=True should raise a RuntimeError.

The potential error location within the initialize function is the elif make_current block. Here, it is checking if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None, and if so, it raises a RuntimeError if make_current is True. This seems to be the incorrect logic.

The bug occurs because the logic in the elif block does not align with the expected behavior. The purpose of the test case is to ensure that if an IOLoop is already marked as current, then creating a new one with make_current=True should raise a RuntimeError. Therefore, the logic inside the elif block needs to be adjusted to reflect this requirement.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic inside the elif block to check if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None when make_current is True. If it is not None, then we should raise a RuntimeError, indicating that the current IOLoop already exists.

Here's the corrected code for the initialize function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the logic now aligns with the expected behavior, and the bug identified in the GitHub issue title "ioloop.py(line 252) is None or not None" should be resolved.
