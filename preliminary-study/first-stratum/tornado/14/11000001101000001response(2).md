Potential error location:
The issue seems to be with the `initialize` method. It is not properly checking the make_current parameter and not calling the make_current method as expected.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The `initialize` method is not handling the make_current parameter properly. It is not properly checking if make_current is True or None, and it should be calling the make_current method accordingly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the make_current parameter properly and call the make_current method based on its value.
2. Fix the conditional statements to handle the make_current parameter correctly.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
