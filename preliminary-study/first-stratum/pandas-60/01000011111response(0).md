1. The test case is checking the behavior of the `rolling().apply()` method with the `raw=True` parameter. It is expected to return an ndarray for each application of the custom function. However, the actual result is different, leading to the test failure.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the `apply()` method, specifically in the section where it is checking the value of `raw` and deciding how to handle the function application accordingly.

3. The bug occurs because the `raw` parameter is not being properly handled in the `apply()` method. It appears that the `raw` parameter is only being used to check if it's a boolean value or not, but it is not being passed to the `apply_func` properly, leading to unexpected behavior.

4. To fix the bug, the `apply()` method needs to ensure that the `raw` parameter is appropriately used in deciding how to handle the function application. It should be passed to the `apply_func` according to the value provided by the user, so that the `rolling().apply()` method respects the `raw` parameter.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `apply()` method:

```python
def apply(
    self,
    func,
    raw: bool = False,
    engine: str = "cython",
    engine_kwargs: Optional[Dict] = None,
    args: Optional[Tuple] = None,
    kwargs: Optional[Dict] = None,
):
    if args is None:
        args = ()
    if kwargs is None:
        kwargs = {}
    kwargs.pop("_level", None)
    kwargs.pop("floor", None)
    window = self._get_window()
    offset = calculate_center_offset(window) if self.center else 0

    if engine not in ["cython", "numba"]:
        raise ValueError("engine must be either 'numba' or 'cython'")

    if engine == "cython" and engine_kwargs is not None:
        raise ValueError("cython engine does not accept engine_kwargs")

    if engine == "numba" and not raw:
        raise ValueError("raw must be `True` when using the numba engine")

    apply_func = self._generate_cython_apply_func(
        args, kwargs, raw, offset, func
    ) if engine == "cython" else generate_numba_apply_func(
        args, kwargs, func, engine_kwargs
    )

    use_numba_cache = engine == "numba"

    if self.engine == "cython" and engine_kwargs is not None:
        raise ValueError("cython engine does not accept engine_kwargs")

    return self._apply(
        apply_func,
        center=False,
        floor=0,
        name=func,
        use_numba_cache=use_numba_cache,
        raw=raw,
    )
```

In the corrected code:
- The `raw` parameter is properly used in deciding which apply_func to use and is passed to the `_apply` method as intended.
- The engine validation has been improved to ensure that only "numba" and "cython" are valid engine values.
- Appropriate error messages are raised for invalid parameter combinations.
