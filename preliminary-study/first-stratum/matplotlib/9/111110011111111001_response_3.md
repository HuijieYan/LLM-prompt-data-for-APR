The error message indicates that there is a problem with the content in the generated image compared to the expected image.

The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the calculation of the `rmin` value and how the value is used subsequently in the code.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `rmin` value is calculated using the `_realViewLim.intervaly` without taking into account the inverted state of the y-axis.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the calculation of the `rmin` value to consider the inverted state of the y-axis.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def draw(self, renderer, *args, **kwargs):
    thetamin, thetamax = np.rad2deg(self._realViewLim.intervalx)
    if thetamin > thetamax:
        thetamin, thetamax = thetamax, thetamin
    
    # Update rmin calculation to consider the inverted state
    if self.yaxis.get_inverted():
        rmin, rmax = ((self._realViewLim.intervaly - self.get_rorigin()) * 
                      -self.get_rsign())  # Negate the value when y-axis is inverted
    else:
        rmin, rmax = ((self._realViewLim.intervaly - self.get_rorigin()) * 
                      self.get_rsign())

    if isinstance(self.patch, mpatches.Wedge):
        # Rest of the code remains the same
        pass
```
