The error in the `draw` function of the `PolarAxes` class seems to be causing issues when drawing a polar plot with the r-origin set. The issue reported is related to saving a PNG plot but doesn't occur when saving as a PDF or working interactively with the UI.

Upon analyzing the faulty `draw` function, it seems that the problem might be related to the calculations and transformations performed within the function, especially around setting the r-origin and adapting the plot accordingly.

The reported bug may occur because the `draw` function is not handling the `get_rorigin()` and `get_rsign()` calculations correctly when setting the r-origin. This might lead to incorrect plot rendering, especially when saving as a PNG.

To fix this bug, it's necessary to ensure that the calculations related to r-origin and adapting the plot are done correctly within the `draw` function. Specifically, adjustments might be needed in the calculations of `rmin`, `rmax`, `radius`, `width`, and `inner_width` when considering the r-origin.

Here is the corrected `draw` function:

```python
def draw(self, renderer, *args, **kwargs):
        thetamin, thetamax = np.rad2deg(self._realViewLim.intervalx)
        if thetamin > thetamax:
            thetamin, thetamax = thetamax, thetamin
            
        rmin = (self._realViewLim.intervaly - self.get_rorigin()) * self.get_rsign()
        rmax = self._realViewLim.intervaly * self.get_rsign()
        
        if isinstance(self.patch, mpatches.Wedge):
            center = self.transWedge.transform((0.5, 0.5))
            self.patch.set_center(center)
            self.patch.set_theta1(thetamin)
            self.patch.set_theta2(thetamax)
            
            edge, _ = self.transWedge.transform((1, 0))
            radius = edge - center[0]
            width = min(radius * (rmax - rmin) / rmax, radius)
            self.patch.set_radius(radius)
            self.patch.set_width(width)
            
            inner_width = radius - width
            inner = self.spines.get('inner', None)
            if inner:
                inner.set_visible(inner_width != 0.0)
        
        visible = not _is_full_circle_deg(thetamin, thetamax)
        start = self.spines.get('start', None)
        end = self.spines.get('end', None)
        if start:
            start.set_visible(visible)
        if end:
            end.set_visible(visible)
        if visible:
            yaxis_text_transform = self._yaxis_transform
        else:
            yaxis_text_transform = self._r_label_position + self.transData
        if self._yaxis_text_transform != yaxis_text_transform:
            self._yaxis_text_transform.set(yaxis_text_transform)
            self.yaxis.reset_ticks()
            self.yaxis.set_clip_path(self.patch)
        
        super().draw(renderer, *args, **kwargs)
```

This corrected code takes into account the calculation of `rmin` and `rmax` based on the r-origin and r-sign. It then correctly adapts the plot and performs the necessary visibility and transformation adjustments.
