The error message in the test function indicates that the images are not close, with an RMS value of 6.526. This suggests that there is a discrepancy in the rendering of the polar plot with the rorigin set.

The bug is likely located within the draw method of the PolarAxes class, specifically in the section that handles the transformation of the wedge and setting its properties. The bug seems to be related to the handling of the rorigin when rendering the polar plot.

The bug occurs because the calculation of rmin and rmax does not account for the rorigin, leading to issues with the positioning and scaling of the wedge patch. This results in discrepancies in the rendered polar plot when the rorigin is set.

To fix the bug, the draw method should properly incorporate the rorigin into the calculations for rmin and rmax, ensuring that the positioning and scaling of the wedge patch are correctly adjusted.

Here's the corrected code for the draw method of the PolarAxes class:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def draw(self, renderer, *args, **kwargs):
    thetamin, thetamax = np.rad2deg(self._realViewLim.intervalx)
    if thetamin > thetamax:
        thetamin, thetamax = thetamax, thetamin
    rmin = self.get_rorigin() - self._realViewLim.intervaly[0]
    rmax = self.get_rorigin() - self._realViewLim.intervaly[1]
    
    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
    
    Axes.draw(self, renderer, *args, **kwargs)
```

In this corrected draw method, the calculation of rmin and rmax accounts for the rorigin by subtracting it from the y-axis interval. This ensures that the wedge patch is positioned and scaled correctly based on the rorigin, addressing the issues with the rendered polar plot when the rorigin is set.
