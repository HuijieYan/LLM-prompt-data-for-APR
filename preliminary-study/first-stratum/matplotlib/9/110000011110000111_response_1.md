The error message indicates that the images are not close, with a RMS value of 6.526, suggesting that the rendered polar plot with the r-origin set does not match the expected plot. This points to a potential issue in the `draw` method of the `PolarAxes` class, as this is where the rendering of the polar plot takes place.

The issue arises from the `ax.set_rorigin(3)` line in the test function. This is causing a problem when saving the polar plot as a png file, whereas saving it as a PDF or using the UI works as expected.

The bug is likely occurring due to a mismatch or inconsistency in the implementation of the `set_rorigin` method and its relationship with the `draw` method when rendering the polar plot. This inconsistency may be causing the unexpected behavior when saving the plot as a png file.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to review the implementation of the `set_rorigin` method and its impact on the `draw` method in the `PolarAxes` class. Specifically, ensure that the `set_rorigin` method sets the r-origin correctly and that this setting is taken into account when rendering the polar plot in the `draw` method.

The corrected function would involve reviewing the implementation of the `set_rorigin` method in the `PolarAxes` class to ensure it sets the r-origin properly and accurately impacts the rendering of the polar plot.

Here is the corrected code for the `draw` method of the `PolarAxes` class:

```python
def draw(self, renderer):
    thetamin, thetamax = np.rad2deg(self._get_view_intervalx())
    if thetamin > thetamax:
        thetamin, thetamax = thetamax, thetamin
    rmin, rmax = ((self._get_view_intervaly() - self.get_rorigin()) *
                  self.get_rsign())
    if isinstance(self.patch, mpatches.Wedge):
        # Backwards-compatibility: Any subclassed Axes might override the
        # patch to not be the Wedge that PolarAxes uses.
        center = self.transWedge.transform((0.5, 0.5))
        self.patch.set_center(center)
        self.patch.set_theta1(thetamin)
        self.patch.set_theta2(thetamax)

        edge, _ = self.transWedge.transform((1, 0))
        radius = edge - center[0]
        width = min(radius * (rmax - rmin) / rmax, radius)
        self.patch.set_radius(radius)
        self.patch.set_width(width)

        inner_width = radius - width
        inner = self.spines.get('inner', None)
        if inner:
            inner.set_visible(inner_width != 0.0)

    visible = not _is_full_circle_deg(thetamin, thetamax)
    # For backwards compatibility, any subclassed Axes might override the
    # spines to not include start/end that PolarAxes uses.
    start = self.spines.get('start', None)
    end = self.spines.get('end', None)
    if start:
        start.set_visible(visible)
    if end:
        end.set_visible(visible)
    if visible:
        yaxis_text_transform = self._yaxis_transform
    else:
        yaxis_text_transform = self._r_label_position + self.transData
    if self._yaxis_text_transform != yaxis_text_transform:
        self._yaxis_text_transform.set(yaxis_text_transform)
        self.yaxis.reset_ticks()
        self.yaxis.set_clip_path(self.patch)

    Axes.draw(self, renderer)
```

This corrected `draw` method should properly account for the r-origin setting when rendering the polar plot, ensuring that the plot is consistent when saved as a png file.
