Potential Error Location: 
The error may be occurring in the logic for expanding the interval when it is too small.

Reason behind the Bug: 
The bug is likely occurring because the logic for expanding the interval is not correctly considering the case when both *vmin* and *vmax* are small but not necessarily equal to zero. As a result, the function is not correctly expanding the interval in this scenario.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check for the case when both *vmin* and *vmax* are small but not necessarily equal to zero, and apply the necessary expansion logic.
2. Ensure that the logic for expanding the interval is working as intended for all possible cases.

Corrected Code:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
