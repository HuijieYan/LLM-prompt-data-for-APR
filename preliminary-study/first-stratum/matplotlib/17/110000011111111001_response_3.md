The issue occurs in the `nonsingular` function, specifically in the `maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))` line, which triggers a RuntimeWarning related to overflow encountered in scalar absolute.

The reason for this bug is that the `abs` function is being applied to values that are too large for the data type to handle properly, leading to an overflow error.

One approach to fixing this bug is to ensure that operations like taking the absolute value do not result in overflow. This can be achieved by casting the input values to a larger data type, such as `np.float64`, before applying the `abs` function.

Below is the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    vmin = np.float64(vmin)  # Casting to np.float64 to prevent overflow
    vmax = np.float64(vmax)  # Casting to np.float64 to prevent overflow

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

By casting `vmin` and `vmax` to `np.float64`, the overflow issue when applying the `abs` function is resolved, and the `nonsingular` function should now behave as expected without triggering any RuntimeWarnings.
