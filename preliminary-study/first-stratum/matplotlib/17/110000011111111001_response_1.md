The error occurs when the function `nonsingular` encounters an overflow in the calculation of `maxabsvalue` due to the use of integer values that exceed the limits for the specified data type. The function fails to handle these large integer values appropriately, leading to an overflow error.

To fix this issue, the `nonsingular` function should cast the input values `vmin` and `vmax` to a float data type before performing any calculations. This will ensure that the calculations are carried out using floating point arithmetic, which can handle larger numerical values without encountering overflow errors.

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    ... (other function details remain the same)

    """
    # Cast vmin and vmax to float to avoid overflow errors
    vmin = float(vmin)
    vmax = float(vmax)

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

By casting `vmin` and `vmax` to float at the beginning of the function, we ensure that all subsequent calculations are carried out using floating point arithmetic, preventing overflow errors when dealing with large numerical values.
