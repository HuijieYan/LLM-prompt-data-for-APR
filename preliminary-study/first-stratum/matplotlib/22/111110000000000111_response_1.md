Based on the GitHub issue provided, the bug appears to occur when using a list of date or datetime objects as the bin edges in the `plt.hist()` function. The error message indicates a TypeError: "'<' not supported between instances of 'float' and 'datetime.datetime'".

The potential error location within the `hist()` function is likely related to the comparison operation (<) being performed between float values and datetime objects, which is not supported.

The reason behind the bug could be that the `hist()` function does not handle datetime bin edges properly, leading to a type promotion error when trying to compare float and datetime objects.

To fix the bug, the `hist()` function needs to be modified to handle datetime bin edges correctly. This may involve converting datetime bin edges to numerical values using `mpl.dates.date2num` as shown in the GitHub issue test case.

Below is the corrected code for the `hist()` function:

```python
# corrected hist function
def hist(self, x, bins=None, range=None, density=False, weights=None,
         cumulative=False, bottom=None, histtype='bar', align='mid',
         orientation='vertical', rwidth=None, log=False,
         color=None, label=None, stacked=False, **kwargs):

    if isinstance(bins, list) and all(isinstance(b, datetime) for b in bins):
        bins = mpl.dates.date2num(bins)

    # the rest of the code remains the same as the original function
    # ...
    # (remaining code omitted for brevity)

    # returning the computed values
    if nx == 1:
        return tops[0], bins, cbook.silent_list('Patch', patches[0])
    else:
        return tops, bins, cbook.silent_list('Lists of Patches', patches)
```

In the corrected code, a check is added to see if the `bins` input is a list of datetime objects. If so, it is converted to numerical values using `mpl.dates.date2num` before further processing. This modification should address the type promotion error when using datetime bins in the `hist()` function.
