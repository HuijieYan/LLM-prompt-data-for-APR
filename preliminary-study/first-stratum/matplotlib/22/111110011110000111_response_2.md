The test case `test_hist_datetime_datasets_bins` is performing a histogram operation using datetime objects as the bin edges. This operation fails with the error message `TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'float' and 'datetime.datetime'`. The error occurs when trying to compare a float value with a datetime object, indicating an issue with type promotion or type casting.

The potential error location within the `hist` function is the code that compares and operates with the bin edges and input data. Specifically, the error occurs when trying to apply the `_search_sorted_inclusive` function.

The bug occurs because the `hist` function doesn't handle the conversion of datetime objects used as bin edges to the equivalent numeric representation correctly. As a result, it leads to type mismatch errors when trying to compare datetime objects with float values during the histogram calculation.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to ensure that the bin edges provided as datetime objects are correctly converted to their numeric representation before being used in the histogram calculation. This conversion will allow the comparison and operations to be performed correctly without type mismatch errors.

Here's the corrected code for the `hist` function with the fix applied:

```python
# Fix for the type promotion error with datetime bins in hist
def hist(self, x, bins=None, weights=None, **kwargs):
    # Convert datetime array to its numeric representation
    if bins and isinstance(bins[0], datetime):
        bins = mpl.dates.date2num(bins)
    
    # Perform the histogram operation with the corrected bin edges
    m, bins = np.histogram(x, bins, weights=weights, **kwargs)
    
    return m, bins
```

In the fixed code, the `bins` parameter is checked for datetime objects, and if found, it's converted to the numeric representation using `mpl.dates.date2num`. This ensures that the bin edges are in a compatible format for comparison and calculation within the histogram operation.

With this fix, the `hist` function should handle datetime bin edges correctly and prevent type promotion errors when performing histogram operations with datetime data.
