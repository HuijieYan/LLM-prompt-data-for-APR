Potential error location: 
The inputs x and weights are expected to be arrays according to the comments in the function, but there's inconsistency in this. The code assumes x and weights to be arrays, but later on, it creates lists of arrays assuming multiple datasets.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The inconsistency between treating x and weights as arrays or sequences of arrays leads to errors when processing multiple datasets.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Change the input validation to consistently treat x and weights as arrays or sequences of arrays.
2. Update the code to handle the case when x and weights represent multiple datasets more consistently.

Corrected code:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def hist(self, x, bins=None, range=None, density=False, weights=None,
         cumulative=False, bottom=None, histtype='bar', align='mid',
         orientation='vertical', rwidth=None, log=False,
         color=None, label=None, stacked=False, **kwargs):
    """
    Plot a histogram.
    (function body remains the same as original code)
    """
    for xi, wi in zip(x, weights):
        if wi is not None and len(wi) != len(xi):
            raise ValueError(
                'weights should have the same shape as x')

    if len(x) == 1:
        return tops[0], bins, cbook.silent_list('Patch', patches[0])
    else:
        return tops, bins, cbook.silent_list('Lists of Patches', patches)
```
