The test case `test_hist_datetime_datasets_bins` is designed to test the `hist` method of the `Axes` class. It passes a list of datetime objects as `data` and a list of datetime objects as `bins` to the `hist` method, and then uses the output to compare the bin edges. The error occurs when the list of datetime objects is used as `bins`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely to be in the calculation of the histogram bins using the `np.histogram` function.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `np.histogram` function is unable to handle datetime objects in the `bins` parameter. This is evident from the error message which states that the '<' operator is not supported between instances of 'float' and 'datetime.datetime'.

To fix the bug, the datetime objects in the `bins` parameter need to be converted to a format that can be handled by the `np.histogram` function.

Here is the corrected code for the `hist` method of the `Axes` class:

```python
def hist(self, x, bins=None, density=False, **kwargs):
    if isinstance(x, (list, tuple)):
        x = [elem for sub_list in x for elem in sub_list]  # Flatten the list of lists
    if isinstance(bins[0], datetime):  # Check if datetime objects are used as bins
        bins = mpl.dates.date2num(bins)  # Convert datetime to a format that can be handled by np.histogram
    # Rest of the original code
```
In the corrected code, the `hist` method checks if datetime objects are used as bins and converts them to a format that can be handled by the `np.histogram` function using `mpl.dates.date2num`. This way, the bug related to the type promotion error with datetime bins in hist is fixed.
