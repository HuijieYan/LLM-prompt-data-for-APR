    Plot a histogram.
    
    Compute and draw the histogram of *x*. The return value is a tuple
    (*n*, *bins*, *patches*) or ([*n0*, *n1*, ...], *bins*, [*patches0*,
    *patches1*,...]) if the input contains multiple data.

    ...

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : (n,) array or sequence of (n,) arrays
        Input values, this takes either a single array or a sequence of
        arrays which are not required to be of the same length.

    bins : int or sequence or str, optional
        If *bins* is an integer, it defines the number of equal-width bins
        in the range.

        If *bins* is a sequence, it defines the bin edges, including the
        left edge of the first bin and the right edge of the last bin;
        in this case, bins may be unequally spaced.  All but the last
        (righthand-most) bin is half-open.  In other words, if *bins* is::

            [1, 2, 3, 4]

        then the first bin is ``[1, 2)`` (including 1, but excluding 2) and
        the second ``[2, 3)``.  The last bin, however, is ``[3, 4]``, which
        *includes* 4.

        If *bins* is a string, it is one of the binning strategies
        supported by `numpy.histogram_bin_edges`: 'auto', 'fd', 'doane',
        'scott', 'stone', 'rice', 'sturges', or 'sqrt'.

        The default is :rc:`hist.bins`.

    range : tuple or None, optional
        The lower and upper range of the bins. Lower and upper outliers
        are ignored. If not provided, *range* is ``(x.min(), x.max())``.
        Range has no effect if *bins* is a sequence.

        If *bins* is a sequence or *range* is specified, autoscaling
        is based on the specified bin range instead of the
        range of x.

        Default is ``None``

    ...

    Returns
    -------
    n : array or list of arrays
        The values of the histogram bins. See *density* and *weights* for a
        description of the possible semantics. If input *x* is an array,
        then this is an array of length *nbins*. If input is a sequence of
        arrays ``[data1, data2, ...]``, then this is a list of arrays with
        the values of the histograms for each of the arrays in the same
        order. The dtype of the array *n* (or of its element arrays) will
        always be float even if no weighting or normalization is used.

    bins : array
        The edges of the bins. Length nbins + 1 (nbins left edges and right
        edge of last bin). Always a single array even when multiple data
        sets are passed in.

    patches : list or list of lists
        Silent list of individual patches used to create the histogram
        or list of such list if multiple input datasets.

    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    **kwargs : `~matplotlib.patches.Patch` properties
