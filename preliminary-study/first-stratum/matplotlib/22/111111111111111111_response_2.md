The error occurs because the `numpy.histogram` function does not support lists of datetime objects for the `bins` parameter. The type promotion error is caused by the inability to compare datetime objects with floats inside the `_search_sorted_inclusive` function of the `numpy.lib.histograms` module.

To fix the bug, you can modify the `hist` method of the `Axes` class to preprocess the datetime bins into a format that can be used by the `numpy.histogram` function.

Here's the corrected `hist` method:

```python
def hist(self, x, bins=None, **kwargs):
    if isinstance(x[0], datetime.datetime):
        bins = mpl.dates.date2num(bins)
    return self.hist(x, bins, **kwargs)
```

With this modification, the `bins` parameter is preprocessed inside the `hist` method, using `mpl.dates.date2num` to convert the datetime bins to a format that can be used by `numpy.histogram`.

By preprocessing the datetime bins, the function will now accept lists of datetime objects for the `bins` parameter and work correctly without the type promotion error.

This solution addresses the underlying problem of type promotion when using datetime bins with the `hist` method of the `Axes` class.
