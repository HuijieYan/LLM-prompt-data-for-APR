The error occurs when using a list of date or datetime objects directly as the bins parameter in the hist function of Matplotlib. The error indicates that there is a type promotion issue, specifically the comparison between a float and a datetime.datetime instance.

The potential error location is within the _search_sorted_inclusive function in the numpy library, which is called when generating the histogram using the list of date or datetime objects as the bins parameter.

The reason for the bug is that the direct use of a list of date or datetime objects as the bins parameter does not handle the type promotion from datetime.datetime to float correctly. This leads to a TypeError when performing comparisons with a float value.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to convert the bins parameter, which is a list of date or datetime objects, to a format that can be directly used for comparison. This may involve converting the datetime objects to numerical values that can be directly compared with other numerical values.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def hist(self, x, bins=None, range=None, density=False, weights=None,
         cumulative=False, bottom=None, histtype='bar', align='mid',
         orientation='vertical', rwidth=None, log=False,
         color=None, label=None, stacked=False, **kwargs):
         
    # ... (existing code)

    if bins is not None and isinstance(bins[0], datetime.datetime):
        # Convert datetime objects to numerical values
        bins = mpl.dates.date2num(bins)

    # ... (remaining existing code)
```

In this corrected version:
1. We check if the bins parameter contains datetime objects.
2. If datetime objects are present, we convert them to numerical values using mpl.dates.date2num.
3. This allows for direct comparison and avoids the type promotion error when calculating the histogram.
