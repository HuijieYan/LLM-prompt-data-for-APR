The error occurs when trying to use a list of datetime objects as bin edges in the hist function. The error message indicates that there is a type promotion issue, specifically a TypeError related to the comparison between float and datetime.datetime instances.

The problematic function seems to be the hist function within the Axes class in the _axes.py file. The error likely arises from the way the function handles bin edges, especially when dealing with datetime objects.

The issue most likely occurs because the histogram function internally converts datetime bin edges to float, leading to the type promotion error when datetime bin edges are passed directly to the hist function.

To fix this issue, the hist function needs to handle datetime bin edges appropriately, ensuring that they are not unintentionally converted to float and that the comparison is handled correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the hist function within the Axes class:

```python
from datetime import datetime
import matplotlib.dates as mdates

class Axes(_AxesBase):
    # ... other functions ...

    def hist(self, x, bins=None, **kwargs):
        if isinstance(bins, (list, tuple)) and all(isinstance(b, datetime) for b in bins):
            bins = mdates.date2num(bins)  # Convert datetime bin edges to float
        # Rest of the function remains the same
```

In this corrected code, we check if the bin edges are a list or tuple of datetime objects. If they are, we convert the datetime bin edges to float using the date2num function from the matplotlib.dates module.

By handling the conversion explicitly and ensuring that the bin edges are appropriately processed, the type promotion error related to datetime bin edges should be resolved.
