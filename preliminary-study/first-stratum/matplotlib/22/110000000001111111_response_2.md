The problem arises in the `hist` function when trying to use a list of datetime as bin edges. This causes a TypeError, as the function doesn't handle datetime objects correctly.

The potential error location within the code is when dealing with the `bins` parameter and the nature of datetime objects.

The bug occurs because the `hist` function does not support datetime objects directly as bin edges. The TypeError is a result of attempting to compare a float (used as bin edges) with a datetime.datetime object.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `hist` function to handle datetime objects correctly by converting datetime objects to numeric values before processing them as bin edges.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import matplotlib.units as units
import matplotlib.dates as dates
import numpy as np

def hist(self, x, bins=None, **kwargs):
    if isinstance(bins[0], (dates.DateConverter, dates.AutoDateLocator)):
        bins = dates.date2num(bins)  # Convert datetime objects to numeric values

    # rest of the function remains the same
    # ...

    hist_kwargs = dict()
    if bins is not None:
        hist_kwargs['bins'] = bins  # use the bins parameter for histogram

    # ... rest of the function remains the same

    return tops, bins, cbook.silent_list('Lists of Patches', patches)
```

This correction involves converting datetime objects to numeric values using the `date2num` function before using them as bin edges. This way, the `hist` function can correctly handle datetime objects without causing a TypeError.
