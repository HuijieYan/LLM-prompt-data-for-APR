The bug occurs in the `hist` function when it is provided with lists of datetime objects as bins. The function does not accept lists of dates or datetime objects as bin edges, causing a TypeError.

The potential error location is in the section of the function where it handles bin range computation and histogram creation using the bins. The error is likely due to the mismatch in data types where the function attempts to compare datetime objects with floats.

The bug occurs because the `hist` function does not handle datetime bins correctly. When provided with lists of datetime objects as bins, the function attempts to compare datetime objects with floats, leading to a TypeError.

To fix this bug, the `hist` function needs to be modified to handle datetime bins correctly. This can be achieved by implementing logic to convert datetime bins into an appropriate format or data type that can be correctly processed for histogram creation.

Here's the corrected code for the `hist` function to handle datetime bins:

```python
import matplotlib.dates as mdates

def hist(self, x, bins=None, range=None, density=False, weights=None,
             cumulative=False, bottom=None, histtype='bar', align='mid',
             orientation='vertical', rwidth=None, log=False,
             color=None, label=None, stacked=False, **kwargs):
    if bins and all(isinstance(item, datetime) for item in bins):
        bins = mdates.date2num(bins)
    # rest of the function
```

In this corrected code, we check if the `bins` parameter contains datetime objects, and if so, we convert them to a numerical format using the `mdates.date2num` function. This ensures that the bins are in a format compatible with the histogram computation, resolving the TypeError issue.
