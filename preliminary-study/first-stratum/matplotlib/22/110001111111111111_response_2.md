The error message indicates that there is a problem in the `_search_sorted_inclusive` function, which is being called from the `hist` method during the histogram binning process. The error occurs due to a comparison between instances of 'float' and 'datetime.datetime'.

It seems that the issue emerges from the inconsistent treatment of date or datetime objects during the histogram binning process. Lists of date or datetime objects are not getting promoted correctly when used as bin edges in the `hist` method. This triggers the TypeError due to less than ('<') not being supported between instances of 'float' and 'datetime.datetime'.

To rectify this issue:
1. The bin edges, when provided as date or datetime objects, should be properly processed to ensure consistent promotion to the appropriate data type.
2. The handling of date or datetime objects within the histogram binning process needs to be reviewed and adjusted to ensure consistent data type usage.
3. Proper data type conversion checks should be implemented to ensure uniform treatment of date or datetime objects in the histogram binning process.

The corrected code for the problematic `hist` method can be structured based on these suggested approaches. However, considering the complexity of the issue, it would be prudent to validate these approaches thoroughly through testing. Here's the corrected `hist` method:

```python
# Assuming these changes to handle datetime objects in the histogram binning process
from datetime import datetime
import matplotlib as mpl
import numpy as np

@_preprocess_data(replace_names=["x", 'weights'], label_namer="x")
def hist(self, x, bins=None, range=None, density=False, weights=None,
             cumulative=False, bottom=None, histtype='bar', align='mid',
             orientation='vertical', rwidth=None, log=False,
             color=None, label=None, stacked=False, **kwargs):

    comparable_bins = bins
    if isinstance(bins, list):
        # Convert the date or datetime objects to a numeric representation (e.g., float)
        comparable_bins = mpl.dates.date2num(bins)

        # Process the input data for uniformity in terms of date or datetime object type
        if isinstance(x[0], datetime):
            x = [mpl.dates.date2num(xi) for xi in x]

    # Rest of the method implementation...
    # <Remaining part of the method implementation>

    return tops, comparable_bins, cbook.silent_list('Lists of Patches', patches)
```

These changes are suggestive and might require further adjustments and validations based on the specific requirements and data type behaviors of the involved methods and classes. It's essential to thoroughly test these changes to ensure that the corrected function effectively addresses the type promotion error with datetime bins in the histogram binning process.
