The error "TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'float' and 'datetime.datetime'" occurs when attempting to use a list of datetime objects as bin edges in the hist function of the matplotlib library.

Based on the provided information, it appears that the error is likely caused by the handling of datetime bins in the code. In the buggy function, the issue seems to arise when the bins are specified as a list of datetime objects.

To resolve this issue, one potential approach is to convert the datetime bin edges to an acceptable format early on in the code. This can involve converting datetime objects to numerical representations using the date2num function from the matplotlib.dates module. By doing this conversion upfront, the error related to comparing floats and datetime objects can be avoided.

Here's the corrected code for the hist method in matplotlib:
```python
import matplotlib.dates as mdates
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def hist(self, x, bins=None, **kwargs):
    if isinstance(bins, list) and all(isinstance(item, datetime) for item in bins):
        bins = mdates.date2num(bins)
    return plt.hist(x, bins, **kwargs)

# Replace `self` with the appropriate reference to the axes or subplot object, or expose `hist` as a standalone function if needed.
```
In this corrected code, the function checks if the bins are specified as a list of datetime objects. If so, it converts the datetime objects to numerical representations using the date2num function before passing them to the matplotlib hist function. This modification should prevent the type promotion error related to datetime bins.
