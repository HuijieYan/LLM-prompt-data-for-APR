The bug occurs in the hist function when using a list of datetime objects as bins. The error message '<' not supported between instances of 'float' and 'datetime.datetime' indicates a type promotion error where datetime objects are being compared to floats.

The potential error location is in the section where the bin edges are being handled and used to create the histogram.

The reason behind the bug is that matplotlib's hist function does not handle datetime bins correctly, leading to a type conversion issue when comparing datetime objects to floats.

To fix the bug, the hist function needs to correctly handle datetime bins. This can be achieved by ensuring that datetime objects are appropriately converted and compared as needed. Additionally, the function should check for the type of the bins and handle them accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import matplotlib.dates as mdates
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from datetime import datetime

def hist(self, x, bins=None, range=None, density=False, weights=None,
         cumulative=False, bottom=None, histtype='bar', align='mid',
         orientation='vertical', rwidth=None, log=False,
         color=None, label=None, stacked=False, **kwargs):
    # Check if bins are datetime objects and convert them if needed
    if isinstance(bins, list) and all(isinstance(b, datetime) for b in bins):
        bins = mdates.date2num(bins)

    # The rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...

    # Return the histogram using the modified bins
    if nx == 1:
        return tops[0], bins, cbook.silent_list('Patch', patches[0])
    else:
        return tops, bins, cbook.silent_list('Lists of Patches', patches)
```
In this corrected code, the function first checks if the bins are of type list and contain datetime objects. If so, it converts the datetime objects to floats using `mdates.date2num` before proceeding with the histogram creation. This addresses the type promotion error that occurs when using datetime objects as bins.
