The error is likely occurring due to the combination of a list of datetime objects being used as bin edges in the `plt.hist(dates, bins=date_edges)` call, which results in a TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'float' and 'datetime.datetime'. This suggests that there might be an issue with the integration of datetime objects as bin edges within the `plt.hist` function.

To fix the bug, it may be necessary to modify the function `hist` to handle datetime objects appropriately. This could involve explicitly converting the datetime bin edges to a suitable numeric representation that can be used for comparison within the function.

Here's the corrected function, which includes type casting of datetime bin edges to numeric values:

```python
def hist(self, x, bins=None, range=None, density=False, weights=None,
         cumulative=False, bottom=None, histtype='bar', align='mid',
         orientation='vertical', rwidth=None, log=False,
         color=None, label=None, stacked=False, **kwargs):
    # ...existing code

    if not input_empty and len(x) > 1:
        if weights is not None:
            _w = np.concatenate(w)
        else:
            _w = None

        # Convert datetime bin edges to numeric representation
        bins = mpl.dates.date2num(bins)

    # ...existing code
```

In this corrected function, the `mpl.dates.date2num` function is used to convert the datetime bin edges to a numeric representation, resolving the type promotion issue. This modification should allow the `plt.hist(dates, bins=date_edges)` call to work as expected.

The correction handles the type promotion error with datetime bins in hist and ensures that the bin edges are properly handled, avoiding type mismatch issues.
