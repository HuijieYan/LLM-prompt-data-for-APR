The error is occurring in the `hist` method of the `Axes` class in the `matplotlib` library. The error message indicates a type promotion error and suggests that the issue is related to the handling of datetime bins in the `hist` method.

The potential error location seems to be in the section where the bins are being processed. It appears that there is a mismatch in the data types being used for comparison, leading to the "TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'float' and 'datetime.datetime'" error.

The occurrence of the bug is likely due to the `hist` method not handling datetime bins as expected. This could be a result of inconsistent handling of datetimes and floats within the method.

To fix the bug, the `hist` method should be modified to handle datetime bins properly. This may involve converting datetime bins to a format that can be compared with the data being plotted.

Here's the corrected code for the `hist` method:

```python
# corrected `hist` method
def hist(self, x, bins=None, range=None, density=False, weights=None,
        cumulative=False, bottom=None, histtype='bar', align='mid',
        orientation='vertical', rwidth=None, log=False,
        color=None, label=None, stacked=False, **kwargs):
    """
    Plot a histogram.

    The `hist` method has been modified to handle datetime bins properly.

    """
    # code for handling datetime bins
    if isinstance(bins, list) and isinstance(bins[0], datetime):
        bins = mpl.dates.date2num(bins)  # convert datetime bins to numeric format for comparison

    # rest of the method remains unchanged
    ...
```

In the corrected code, we have added a conditional check to handle the case where the bins are of datetime type. If the bins are a list of datetime objects, we convert them to a numeric format using `mpl.dates.date2num` for comparison with the data being plotted. This modification should address the type promotion error with datetime bins in the `hist` method.
