The error occurs when the `hist` function tries to process the input data with datetime bins. The function attempts to compare a float and a datetime object, resulting in a TypeError.

The issue stems from the fact that the `hist` function does not handle datetime bins correctly. When bins are provided as a list of datetime objects, it fails to convert these datetime objects into a format that can be compared to the data. This results in the TypeError that was observed.

To fix the bug, the `hist` function should be modified to ensure that datetime bins are appropriately handled. When datetime bins are passed, these should be converted and processed to allow for proper comparison with the input data. The corrections should include handling for datetime bins in a way that avoids the TypeError by converting the datetime objects to a format that allows for comparison.

Here is the corrected code for the `hist` function:

```python
from datetime import datetime

def hist(self, x, bins=None, **kwargs):
    # Convert datetime bins to their numeric representation
    if isinstance(bins, (list, tuple)) and all(isinstance(b, datetime) for b in bins):
        bins = mpl.dates.date2num(bins)

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```
