Potential error location: The issue seems to be in the `_recache` function of the `MarkerStyle` class that doesn't correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` passed during initialization.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The `filled` attribute (which should correspond to the `fillstyle` parameter) is not being correctly set when a `MarkerStyle` object is created.

Approach for fixing the bug: We need to update the `_recache` function to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter passed during the `MarkerStyle` object initialization.

Here is the corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Updated line
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the line `self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'`, the `_filled` attribute will correctly reflect the `fillstyle` parameter, and the test case `test_marker_fillstyle` will pass without errors.
