The error is likely occurring in the `_recache` method of the `MarkerStyle` class. The issue is that the `_filled` attribute is always being set to `False` in the `_recache` method, even when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. This causes the markers to be filled, which is not the expected behavior based on the usage described in the GitHub issue.

To fix this issue, we need to update the `_recache` method to correctly handle the `fillstyle` parameter. If the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`, otherwise it should be set to `True`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` method:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this change, the `_filled` attribute will now correctly reflect the `fillstyle` parameter passed to the `MarkerStyle` class, and the markers will be hollow when `fillstyle` is set to `'none', which resolves the issue described in the GitHub report.
