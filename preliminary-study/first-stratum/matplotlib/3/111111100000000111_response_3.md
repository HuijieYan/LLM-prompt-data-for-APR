Potential error location: The issue is likely occurring in the `_recache` method of the `MarkerStyle` class. When attempting to create a hollow marker by setting the `fillstyle` to 'none', the marker does not appear as expected.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: It seems that the `_recache` method does not handle the `fillstyle` parameter correctly, leading to the marker not being rendered as hollow when expected.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: The `_recache` method should be modified to properly handle the `fillstyle` parameter and set the marker as hollow when 'none' is specified.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` method:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Set filled to False for hollow markers
    self._marker_function()
```
