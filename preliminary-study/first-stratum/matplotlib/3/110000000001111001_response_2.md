The issue with the _recache function is that when the _marker_function is called, it sets self._filled to True regardless of the current value of self._fillstyle. This suggests that there is a logical error in the function as it does not consider the current state of self._filled before setting its value to True. 

To fix this bug, you can modify the function to check the value of self._fillstyle and set self._filled accordingly. 

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle != 'none':
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```
