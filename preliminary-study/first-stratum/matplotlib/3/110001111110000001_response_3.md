The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is not returning the expected value, leading to an assertion error in the test function `test_marker_fillstyle`.

The potential error location within the `_recache` function is the line `self._filled = True` which always sets the `_filled` attribute to True, regardless of the actual fillstyle provided.

The bug occurs because the `_recache` function does not take into account the fillstyle when setting the `_filled` attribute to True by default, which causes issues when the `is_filled` method is called.

To fix the bug, the `_recache` function should check the fillstyle and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly. If the fillstyle is 'none', then `_filled` should be set to False.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'

    if self._fillstyle != 'full':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
        
    self._marker_function()
```

With this modification, the `_recache` function will correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle, preventing the erroneous behavior observed in the test case.
