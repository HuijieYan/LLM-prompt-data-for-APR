Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the `is_filled()` method within the `MarkerStyle()` class.

Reasons behind the bug: The `is_filled()` method is not returning the expected value.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: We need to modify the `_recache()` method within the `MarkerStyle()` class to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache()` method:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

This corrected code assigns the value of `_filled` based on the `fillstyle` set for the marker, which should address the issue in the test case.
