Potential error location: The line `self._marker_function()` is attempting to call the `_marker_function` attribute as if it were a method, when it is likely intended to be a class method or function.

Reasons behind the bug: The `self._marker_function()` line is trying to call a method that does not exist within the current class or any of its parent classes, resulting in an AttributeError.

Approaches for fixing the bug: The `_marker_function` should either be defined as a method within the class or passed in as a function parameter when creating an instance of the class.

Corrected code:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None or not callable(self._marker_function):
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```
