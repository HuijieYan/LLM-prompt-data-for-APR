The potential error in the provided code is that the `_marker_function` method is being called without being checked if it exists or not, which can lead to a "NoneType" object has no attribute error. The code needs to be modified to check if `_marker_function` exists before calling it.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to add a check for the existence of `_marker_function` before calling it. If it does not exist, then the function should just return without doing anything.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` method:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```
