The bug in the provided function is that it does not actually clear the marker properties. In the GitHub issue, the user is experiencing an issue with markers not being hollow when setting fillstyle to 'none'. This indicates that the marker properties are not being reset properly when the marker function is called.

To fix the bug, we need to update the _recache function to properly clear the marker properties as the user expects.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = None  # Clear the path
    self._transform = None  # Clear the transform
    self._alt_path = None  # Clear the alt_path
    self._alt_transform = None  # Clear the alt_transform
    self._snap_threshold = None  # Clear the snap_threshold
    self._joinstyle = 'round'  # Reset to default joinstyle
    self._capstyle = 'butt'  # Reset to default capstyle
    self._filled = True  # Reset filled to default
    self._marker_function()
```

With these updates, the _recache function will properly clear the marker properties, which should address the issue the user is experiencing with markers not being hollow when fillstyle is set to 'none'.
