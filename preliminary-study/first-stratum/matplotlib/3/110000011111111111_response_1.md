The error seems to occur in the `test_marker_fillstyle` function, where it expects the marker style to not be filled. The error message indicates that for some reason, the `is_filled()` method of the `marker_style` object is returning `True` instead of `False`.

Looking at the `MarkerStyle` class and the `_recache` method, it appears that when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the `_filled` attribute of the `MarkerStyle` instance should be set to `False`. However, the `_recache` method always sets `_filled` to `True`, ignoring the `fillstyle` parameter.

To fix this, the `_recache` method should account for the `fillstyle` parameter and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` method:

```python
# Corrected function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the `_filled` attribute will be set to `False`, as expected. This should address the issue encountered in the test case.
