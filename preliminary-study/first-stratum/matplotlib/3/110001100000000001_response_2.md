Potential error location: The error seems to be in the line `self._marker_function()` as it is attempting to call a method/function that has not been defined or assigned.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `_marker_function` attribute/method is not defined anywhere in the given code snippet, so calling it will result in an error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: There are a couple of approaches to fix this bug. One approach would be to define the `_marker_function` method within the class and then call it in the `_recache` method. Another approach would be to remove the line `self._marker_function()` if it is not necessary for the functionality of the class.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:  # Check if _marker_function exists
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()  # Call _marker_function if it exists
```
