Potential Error Location: The error is likely occurring in the `is_filled()` method of the `MarkerStyle` class, which is being called in the `test_marker_fillstyle()` function.

Reason for Bug: The bug is likely occurring because the `_recache()` method, which initializes various attributes of the `MarkerStyle` class, is not properly setting the `_filled` attribute.

Approaches to Fix the Bug: The `_recache()` method should correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the fill style.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache()` method:

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():
    # ... omitted code ...

    # corrected _recache method
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # update _filled based on the fill style
        self._marker_function()
```
