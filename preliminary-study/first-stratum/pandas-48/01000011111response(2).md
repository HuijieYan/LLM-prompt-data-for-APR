1. The test case involves calling the `mean`, `median`, and `var` functions on a DataFrameGroupBy with `Int64` dtype, which is resulting in a TypeError. This is caused by an error in the code, resulting in incompatible types used for casting and aggregation.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `_cython_agg_blocks` method, specifically during the casting of values to a different dtype.

3. The bug occurs because the code does not handle the casting of different types safely. When calling `mean`, `median`, or `var` on nullable integer data using `Int64` dtype, it results in a TypeError. This is because the safe casting of different dtypes is not handled properly, leading to the TypeError.

4. To fix the bug, the code needs to be modified to handle the casting of different dtypes in a safe manner. This would involve checking for equivalent types and casting in a way that avoids the TypeError.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# signature of a relative function in this class
def aggregate(self, func=None, *args, **kwargs):
    # ... omitted code ...

# signature of a relative function in this class
def _get_data_to_aggregate(self) -> BlockManager:
    # ... omitted code ...

# this is the fixed function
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... original code goes here ...

    for block in data.blocks:
        # ... (omitted code)
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # ... (omitted code)
        except TypeError:
            # Handle TypeError by specifying dtype as float for safe casting
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values.astype(np.float), how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        # ... (omitted code)
    # ... (omitted code)
    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected code, a TypeError is handled by specifying the dtype as float for safe casting, allowing the aggregation functions to work properly with nullable integer data using `Int64` dtype.
