The error message "TypeError: Cannot cast array from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64') according to the rule 'safe'" is suggesting that there is a type casting issue occurring in the buggy function. The buggy function is likely trying to cast a `float64` type to an `int64` type, which is not allowed due to potential data loss.

The code does contain logic for converting a pandas DataFrame with nullable integer data type to a float data type and then applying aggregation functions like mean, median, and var. However, the bug occurs when the aggregation function returns a float type which is then attempted to be cast to an integer. This results in the type casting error.

To fix this issue, the code should be modified to handle the application of aggregation functions for nullable integer data in a way that does not attempt to cast float types to integer.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks = []
    new_items = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)[0]
        
        dtype = result.dtype
        if dtype.kind == 'f':
            # Convert float dtype to object
            result = result.astype('O')

        agg_block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(result.index)

        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # rest of the code remains the same
    # ...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected code handles the conversion of float types to object types in case the aggregation result is a float, avoiding the type casting error. Additionally, it makes use of the aggregation result's dtype to determine whether conversion is necessary, and it would handle nan and nullable integer types appropriately.
