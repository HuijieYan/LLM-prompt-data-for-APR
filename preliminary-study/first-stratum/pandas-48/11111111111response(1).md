1. The error message is related to the `safe_cast` function, which is used to safely cast values to a specified data type. The error occurs when trying to convert an array from dtype 'float64' to 'int64' according to the rule 'safe', leading to a TypeError. The test function calls the `mean`, `median`, and `var` functions using a DataFrameGroupBy. The error message indicates that the error arises due to conversions between float and integer data types, which seems to be handled by the `safe_cast` function.

2. The potential error location is likely within the `_cython_agg_blocks` method, specifically in the logic that involves type conversions when performing aggregation operations on the DataFrameGroupBy object. It's likely that the code is not handling conversions between float and int data types correctly.

3. The error occurs because the code is failing to safely cast float values to integer values due to the type mismatch between float64 and int64. This is a case of incompatible type conversion which is not being handled properly within the function.

4. To fix the bug, the code needs to implement proper handling of the conversion of float values to integer values, especially when performing aggregation operations that require this type of conversion. This can be done by modifying the safe_cast function or by using a different type conversion approach that handles this case correctly.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    # ... (other code)

    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        is_float_array = block.dtype.kind == 'f'
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Handle non-applicable functions
            if is_float_array:
                # Handle float array
                result = block.values.astype(int)
            else:
                result = block.values
                # Handle cases where the aggregation function is not implemented

        # Rest of the code remains the same
```

In the corrected code, the `_cython_agg_blocks` function checks if the block's dtype is a float array. If it is, it safely casts (implicitly) the float values to integer values using the `astype` method. If the aggregation function is not applicable, it handles the float or integer array accordingly to avoid type conversion issues. This should address the error related to safely casting non-equivalent float64 to int64.
