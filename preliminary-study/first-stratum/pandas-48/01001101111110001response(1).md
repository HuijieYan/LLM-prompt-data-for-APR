The error message indicates that there is a casting issue from float64 to int64, suggesting that there is a type mismatch that is causing this error.

The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be in the section where the result is cast to an inappropriate dtype. This could be happening when the function is called with a 'var' method.

The bug occurs because the 'var' function calculates variance, which usually results in floating-point numbers, but the DataFrame is of type 'Int64'. Hence, there is a type mismatch when the result is being cast back to the original dtype.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that the dtype of the DataFrame is appropriately handled when calling the 'var' function. This can be done by explicitly casting the DataFrame to a floating-point type before calling the 'var' function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    if how == "var":
        data = data.astype(float)  # Explicitly cast to floating-point type

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    # ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This modified code ensures that the DataFrame is cast to a floating-point type before calling the 'var' function, thereby addressing the type mismatch issue.
