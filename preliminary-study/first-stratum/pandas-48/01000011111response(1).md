1. The test cases are calling the `mean`, `median`, and `var` functions on a DataFrameGroupBy object with Int64 dtype values. The expected behavior is to calculate the mean, median, and variance of the grouped values. However, the error message indicates a TypeError related to casting array from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64') according to the rule 'safe'. This indicates a problem related to data type casting within the implementation of the aggregation functions.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely to be the `safe_cast` function, where the error message indicates a problem related to casting array types.

3. The bug occurs because the safe_cast function is intended to safely cast values to a specified dtype with the "safe" casting rule. However, it encounters an issue when trying to cast float64 values to int64 using the "safe" casting rule. This error occurs when the aggregation functions such as `mean`, `median`, and `var` are called, and the underlying code attempts to perform data type casting.

4. To fix this bug, the safe_cast function needs to be modified to handle the specified data type conversions appropriately. This might involve checking the data types, and if the conversion is not feasible with the "safe" casting rule, handling it appropriately, such as by returning a different data type or raising a clear and informative error.

5. Below is the corrected code for the problematic function `_cython_agg_blocks`:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... existing code ...

    for block in data.blocks:
        # existing code ...

        if result is not no_result:
            # existing code ...

            if result.dtype == 'float64' and block.dtype == 'Int64':
                # Convert float64 to Int64 if possible
                try:
                    result = result.astype('Int64')  # Use the nullable integer dtype for safe casting
                except TypeError:
                    raise TypeError(f"cannot safely cast non-equivalent {result.dtype} to Int64")
                else:
                    # unwrap DataFrame to get array
                    if len(result._data.blocks) != 1:
                        # existing code ...

    # ... existing code ...
```

In this corrected code, the safe_cast logic has been integrated within the existing function to handle the specific case of casting float64 to Int64. The safe casting is attempted and if the casting is not feasible, a clear and informative error is raised. This fix ensures that the appropriate data type conversions are handled safely and accurately.
