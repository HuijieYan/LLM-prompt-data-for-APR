The issue with the function is that it is trying to cast a `float64` value to `int64`, which results in a `TypeError`. To fix this issue, you can use the `safe_cast` function in the `pandas` library to safely cast the values to the specified dtype if they are equivalent.

Here is the corrected and updated function with the use of `safe_cast`:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... OMITTED CODE ...

    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # ... OMITTED CODE ...

        assert not isinstance(result, DataFrame)

        if result is not no_result:
            # see if we can cast the block back to the original dtype
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
                result = safe_cast(result, block.dtype, copy=False)  # Safe casting
                agg_block = block.make_block(result)
        
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # ... OMITTED CODE ...
```

By using `safe_cast`, the issue with casting incompatible data types is addressed, and the function should work correctly in scenarios where `float64` values need to be safely cast to `int64` without generating a `TypeError`.
