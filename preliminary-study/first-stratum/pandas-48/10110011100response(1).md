The given issue that needs to be fixed seems to be related to improper casting of values between int64 and float64 data types. The function `safe_cast` should ensure that the values are safely cast to the specified data type and are equivalent. The error is likely caused due to non-equivalent values with incompatible data types while performing computations.

To fix this issue, you should ensure that correct typecasting and safe comparison of values are performed. An updated function with improvements to casting and comparison can help to resolve the issue.

The updated function to handle typecasting and safe comparison of values can be as follows:

```python
def safe_cast(values, dtype, copy: bool):
    """
    Safely cast the values to the dtype if they
    are equivalent, meaning floats must be equivalent to the
    ints.

    """
    try:
        # Cast the values to the specified data type, performing safe casting
        casted_values = values.astype(dtype, casting="safe", copy=copy)

        # Ensure that the casted values are equivalent to the original values
        if (casted_values == values).all():
            return casted_values
        else:
            # Raise an error indicating non-equivalent data types
            raise TypeError(f"cannot safely cast non-equivalent {values.dtype} to {np.dtype(dtype)}")
    except TypeError as err:
        # Handle any TypeError exceptions during typecasting
        casted_values = values.astype(dtype, copy=copy)
        if (casted_values == values).all():
            return casted_values
        else:
            # Ensure that different data types are handled appropriately
            raise TypeError(f"cannot safely cast non-equivalent {values.dtype} to {np.dtype(dtype)}") from err
```

This updated function ensures that typecasting is performed safely and non-equivalent values with different data types are handled appropriately. By ensuring a safe and equivalent cast, the TypeError issue seen in the test functions should be resolved.

After updating the function, the code should be thoroughly tested to ensure that the updated function works as expected and resolves the TypeError issue in the test cases.
