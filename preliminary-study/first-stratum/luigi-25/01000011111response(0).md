1. The error message indicates a TypeError occurred in the `run` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class, specifically at the line `path = self.s3_load_path()`. The error message indicates that a 'str' object is not callable, suggesting that `self.s3_load_path` is being treated as a string instead of a method.

2. The potential error location is the line `path = self.s3_load_path()` within the `run` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class.

3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that `self.s3_load_path` is being called as a method by using parentheses `()` at the end, but it is actually assigned as a string property in the class definition. This mismatch causes the TypeError.

4. To fix the bug, the `path = self.s3_load_path()` line should be modified to remove the parentheses and treat `self.s3_load_path` as a string property.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def run(self):
    
    if not self.table:
        raise Exception("Table needs to be specified")
    
    path = self.s3_load_path  # Removed parentheses
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)
    
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()
    
    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```
