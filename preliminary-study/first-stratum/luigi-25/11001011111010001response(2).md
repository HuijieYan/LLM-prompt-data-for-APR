The error is likely occurring in the line `mock_copy.assert_called_with(mock_cursor, task.s3_load_path)`. This implies that the `task.s3_load_path` is considered a string and not a method, as expected.

The bug in the code is caused by the presence of multiple `s3_load_path` and `copy` functions within the class. It seems that the `self.s3_load_path` and `self.copy` references should point to the methods defined within the class, rather than the function with the same name outside of the class.

To fix this bug, the duplicated function definitions should be removed and the references should point to the correct methods within the class.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def run(self):
    if not (self.table):
        raise Exception("table need to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path()
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```
