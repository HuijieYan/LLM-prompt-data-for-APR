The error message "TypeError: 'str' object is not callable" indicates that there is an attempt to call a string object as if it were a function. This suggests that there might be an issue with using `task.s3_load_path` as a function when it is actually a string.

Upon further analysis, it seems that `self.s3_load_path` is referenced as a function, but the actual implementation is missing. This is most likely causing the issue of attempting to call a string as a function.

To fix this issue, the `self.s3_load_path` function should be implemented to return the appropriate S3 load path for the given task.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def s3_load_path(self):
    # Implementation to get the S3 load path for the task
    return "s3://bucket/key"

def run(self):
    if not (self.table):
        raise Exception("table need to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path()
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```

By implementing the `s3_load_path` function with the appropriate S3 load path and using it as intended within the `run` method, the issue with calling a string as a function should be resolved.
