The error occurs when the function `self.s3_load_path()` is called, resulting in a 'TypeError: 'str' object is not callable'. This error suggests that `self.s3_load_path` is being treated as a method and called as a function, but it is actually a parameter and should not be callable.

To fix this bug, the line `path = self.s3_load_path()` should be changed to `path = self.s3_load_path` in the `run` method. This change ensures that `self.s3_load_path` is accessed as a parameter rather than being called as a function.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def run(self):
    
    if not (self.table):
        raise Exception("table need to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```

By making this change, the bug causing the TypeError will be resolved.
