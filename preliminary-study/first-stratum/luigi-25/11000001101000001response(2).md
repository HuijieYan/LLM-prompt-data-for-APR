The bug seems to be in the `run` method of the `DummyS3CopyToTable` class. The method tries to access certain attributes and methods without referring to `self`.

The problem occurs because the method doesn't use `self` to access class attributes and methods, which results in them not being recognized.

To fix this bug, you should use `self` to reference the class attributes and methods inside the `run` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `run` method:

```python
def run(self):
    if not (self.table):
        raise Exception("table needs to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path()
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```

In the corrected code, I have added `self` before references to `table`, `s3_load_path`, `output`, `does_table_exist`, `create_table`, `do_truncate_table`, `truncate_table`, and `init_copy` to ensure they are accessed from the class instance. This should resolve the issue.
