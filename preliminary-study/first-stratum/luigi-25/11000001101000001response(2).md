The potential error in the `run` function arises from the use of undefined functions in the source code, such as `init_copy` and `logger` variables without any definition or imported module. These undefined variables may lead to crashes when running the code.

The `run` function also calls `output` multiple times, which may not behave as intended.

To fix this bug:
1. Ensure that all required functions and variables are defined or imported before using them in the `run` function.
2. Check if the `init_copy` and `logger` variables are intended to be used and if so, define or import them accordingly.
3. Review the usage of the `output` function to determine if it should be called multiple times or if there was a mistake in the function calls.

Corrected code for the `run` function:

```python
import logging  # Assuming logger needs to be imported

class S3CopyToTable:
    # Other function definitions ...

    def run(self):
        if not self.table:
            raise Exception("table needs to be specified")

        path = self.s3_load_path()
        connection = self.output().connect()
        
        if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
            # try creating table
            logging.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
            connection.reset()
            self.create_table(connection)
        
        elif self.do_truncate_table():
            logging.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
            self.truncate_table(connection)

        logging.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        # Assuming `init_copy` is defined
        self.init_copy(connection)
        self.copy(cursor, path)
        self.output().touch(connection)
        connection.commit()

        # commit and clean up
        connection.close()
```

In the corrected code:
- `logger` is replaced with `logging` and is imported at the start of the file assuming that's required.
- The `init_copy` and `output` functions are used as before assuming they are defined or imported correctly. If not, definitions or imports should be provided accordingly.
- The use of `output` multiple times is retained, assuming it's intended behavior.
