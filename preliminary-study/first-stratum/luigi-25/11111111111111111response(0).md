The error is occurring at line 166 of the `run` method in the `S3CopyToTable` class. The line `path = self.s3_load_path()` is causing a TypeError because `self.s3_load_path` is a string and not a method or function. 

The reason for this bug is that the `S3CopyToTable` class has a `s3_load_path` method as well as a `s3_load_path` attribute which is a string. When the `run` method calls `self.s3_load_path()`, it mistakenly tries to call the string instead of the method.

To fix this bug, the `run` method should use the `s3_load_path` attribute directly without attempting to call it.

Here's the corrected code for the `run` method:

```python
def run(self):
    """
    If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
    will be called to attempt to create the table.
    """

    if not (self.table):
        raise Exception("table need to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path  # use the attribute directly
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```

By using the attribute directly, the bug is fixed and the `run` method should now work as intended.
