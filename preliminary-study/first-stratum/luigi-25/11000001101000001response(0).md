The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `run` method. The specific issue seems to be that the method is trying to access `self.table` without having it initialized or defined anywhere within the function or the class.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `run` method checks if `self.table` is specified. If it's not specified, it raises an exception. However, in the given details, it's not clear where `self.table` is supposed to be initialized.

To fix the bug, `self.table` needs to be either initialized within the class or passed as an argument to the `run` method. If `self.table` should be an instance attribute, it needs to be initialized in the `__init__` method of the class.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function including the initialization of `self.table`:

```python
class DummyS3CopyToTable:
    def __init__(self):
        self.table = "dummy_table"
        self.database = "dummy_database"
        self.host = "dummy_host"
        self.user = "dummy_user"
        self.password = "dummy_password"

    def s3_load_path(self):
        ...

    def do_truncate_table(self):
        ...

    def truncate_table(self, connection):
        ...

    def create_table(self, connection):
        ...

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        ...

    def output(self):
        ...

    def does_table_exist(self, connection):
        ...

    def run(self):
        if not (self.table):
            raise Exception("table needs to be specified")

        path = self.s3_load_path()
        connection = self.output().connect()
        if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
            # try creating table
            logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
            connection.reset()
            self.create_table(connection)
        elif self.do_truncate_table():
            logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
            self.truncate_table(connection)

        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        self.init_copy(connection)
        self.copy(cursor, path)
        self.output().touch(connection)
        connection.commit()

        # commit and clean up
        connection.close()
```

In the above code, `self.table` is initialized in the `__init__` method of the `DummyS3CopyToTable` class, ensuring that `self.table` is specified when an instance of the class is created.
