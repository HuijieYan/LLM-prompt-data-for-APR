The error occurs in the `run` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class where the `s3_load_path` attribute is being called as a method, but it is defined as a string. This is causing the TypeError: 'str' object is not callable.

To fix the bug, the `self.s3_load_path` attribute should be accessed directly without parentheses, as it is not a method but a string attribute.

Here's the corrected code for the `run` method:

```python
def run(self):
    """
    If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
    will be called to attempt to create the table.
    """
    
    if not self.table:
        raise Exception("table needs to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path  # accessing attribute directly
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    # rest of the code...
}
```
