The error occurs in the `run` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi.contrib.redshift` module. The error is a `TypeError` due to trying to call a string object `self.s3_load_path()`, which is not callable.

The reason for this error is that `s3_load_path` is defined as an instance variable of the `S3CopyToTable` class. However, it is also defined as a method within the same class, therefore, when `self.s3_load_path()` is called, it is referencing the instance variable which is a string, not the method.

One possible approach to fixing this bug is to rename the instance variable `s3_load_path` to a different name to avoid the conflict with the method `s3_load_path`. For example, it could be renamed to `s3_path`.

Here's the corrected code for the `S3CopyToTable` class with the variable renamed to `s3_path`:

```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable):
    # ... other methods ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def run(self):
        """
        If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
        will be called to attempt to create the table.
        """
        if not self.table:
            raise Exception("table needs to be specified")

        path = self.s3_path  # Rename the variable
        connection = self.output().connect()
        if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
            # try creating table
            logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
            connection.reset()
            self.create_table(connection)
        elif self.do_truncate_table():
            logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
            self.truncate_table(connection)

        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        self.init_copy(connection)
        self.copy(cursor, path)
        self.output().touch(connection)
        connection.commit()

        # commit and clean up
        connection.close()
```

By renaming the instance variable, the conflict with the method is resolved, and the `TypeError` should be fixed.
