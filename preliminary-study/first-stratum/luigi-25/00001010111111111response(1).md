The error occurs at the line `path = self.s3_load_path()` in the `run` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class. The error message indicates that the `s3_load_path` attribute is being treated as a callable (function), but it is actually a string, leading to the `TypeError`.

The bug occurs because the `s3_load_path` attribute is defined as a string type in the class, but the `run` method is mistakenly trying to call it as if it were a function.

To fix this bug, the `run` method should directly use the attribute `self.s3_load_path` as a string instead of treating it as a callable function.

Here's the corrected code for the `run` method:

```python
def run(self):
    
    if not (self.table):
        raise Exception("table need to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path  # Using the attribute directly as a string
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```

In this corrected code, the `path` variable is assigned the value of `self.s3_load_path` directly, without trying to call it as a function. This should resolve the TypeError issue.
