The bug in the provided code is likely due to the misuse of the `self.s3_load_path` attribute in the `run` method. In the test function, `mock_copy.assert_called_with(mock_cursor, task.s3_load_path)` suggests that `task.s3_load_path` is treated as a callable object (method or function), but it should be a string representing the S3 path.

To fix this bug:
1. Modify the `run` method to correctly use `self.s3_load_path` as a string, instead of calling it as a method.
2. Ensure that the `S3CopyToTable.s3_load_path` attribute is correctly assigned and accessed as a string.

Here's the corrected code for the `run` method:

```python
def run(self):
    if not (self.table):
        raise Exception("table needs to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```

By directly using `self.s3_load_path` as a string in the `run` method, the issue with the TypeError should be resolved.
