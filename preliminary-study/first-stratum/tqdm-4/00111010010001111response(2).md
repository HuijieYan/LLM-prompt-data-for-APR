The error in the buggy function seems to be occurring due to the incorrect handling of the `unit_scale` parameter. The error message specifically points to the line where `total *= unit_scale` is being executed as the cause of the TypeError.

The issue seems to be that the `unit_scale` is being treated as an integer, but in some cases, it is also used as a boolean. This inconsistency in the usage of `unit_scale` is likely causing the problem.

To fix this bug, the type of `unit_scale` should be checked before performing any operations on `total` or `n`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    """
    Return a string-based progress bar given some parameters
    ...
    """

    # sanity check: total
    if total and n > total:
        total = None

    # apply custom scale if necessary
    if unit_scale and unit_scale is not True:
        total *= unit_scale
        n *= unit_scale
        if rate:
            rate *= unit_scale  # by default rate = 1 / self.avg_time
        unit_scale = False

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

In the corrected code, `unit_scale` is explicitly checked for `True` before using it to perform any operations. This approach ensures that the variable is used consistently and prevents any potential TypeErrors that could occur due to mixed usage of `unit_scale` as an integer and a boolean.
