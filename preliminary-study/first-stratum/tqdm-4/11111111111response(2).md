1. The test case is trying to use the `tqdm` function with the `unit_scale` parameter set to 10. However, it encounters a `TypeError` related to the `total` variable when trying to apply the custom scale.

2. The potential error location is in the section of code where the custom scale is applied to the `total` variable in the `format_meter` function.

3. The error occurs because the code attempts to modify the `total` variable by multiplying it with the `unit_scale`, but in some cases, `total` might be `None`, which results in a `TypeError` when trying to perform multiplication.

4. To fix the bug, we can add a check to ensure that `total` is not `None` before attempting to apply the custom scale. If `total` is `None`, we can skip the scaling operation.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `format_meter` function:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    """
    Return a string-based progress bar given some parameters

    ... (other function comments remain the same)

    Returns
    -------
    out  : Formatted meter and stats, ready to display.
    """

    # sanity check: total
    if total and n > total:
        total = None

    # apply custom scale if necessary
    if unit_scale and unit_scale not in (True, 1):
        if total:  # Check if total is not None
            total *= unit_scale
            n *= unit_scale
            if rate:
                rate *= unit_scale  # by default rate = 1 / self.avg_time
            unit_scale = False

    # (rest of the code remains the same)
```

In the corrected code, we added a check for `total` before attempting to apply the custom scale. If `total` is not `None`, then the scaling operation will be applied. Otherwise, the scaling will be skipped, preventing the `TypeError` that occurred in the original code.
