1. The test case is attempting to use the `format_meter` function with `unit_scale` set to 10. The error message indicates that the error occurs when the `total` is being multiplied by `unit_scale`.

2. The potential error location within the `format_meter` function is identified as the line where `total` is being modified with `total *= unit_scale`.

3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that if `total` is None, it cannot be multiplied by `unit_scale`, resulting in a `TypeError`.

4. One possible approach to fixing the bug is to add a condition to check if `total` is not None before performing the multiplication with `unit_scale`.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `format_meter` function:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    # sanity check: total
    if total is not None and n > total:
        total = None

    # apply custom scale if necessary
    if unit_scale and unit_scale not in (True, 1):
        if total is not None:
            total *= unit_scale
        n *= unit_scale
        if rate:
            rate *= unit_scale  # by default rate = 1 / self.avg_time
        unit_scale = False

    # rest of the function...
```

In the corrected code, an additional check is added to ensure that `total` is not None before performing the multiplication with `unit_scale`.
