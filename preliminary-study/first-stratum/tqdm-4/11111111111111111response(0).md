The error seems to be occurring in the function `format_meter`, specifically at the line `total *= unit_scale`. The error message indicates a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *=: 'NoneType' and 'int'`.

The reason behind this error is that the variable `total` is being set to `None` if the condition `total and n > total` is met. This `None` value is then used in the calculation `total *= unit_scale`, which results in the mentioned TypeError.

To fix this issue, we can modify the if statement where `total` is set to `None` to handle the `None` case differently. For example, if `total` is `None`, we can set `total` to `n` multiplied by `unit_scale` instead.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_meter` function:

```python
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
    unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
    postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    
    # sanity check: total
    if total and n > total:
        total = None
    elif total:  # handle the case where total is not None
        total *= unit_scale

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

By making this change, we ensure that `total` is only set to `None` when the condition `total and n > total` is met. Otherwise, we apply the `unit_scale` to the `total` variable without causing a TypeError due to `None` type.
