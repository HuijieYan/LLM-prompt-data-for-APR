The error occurs due to the multiplication operation performed on the variable 'total', which is assigned a value of 'None' in the buggy function. This is because the variable 'total' is reassigned to 'None' in the code block `if total and n > total`. As a result, when attempting to perform operations such as multiplication on 'total', it causes a TypeError due to the 'NoneType' not supporting the multiplication operation.

To fix this issue, we need to provide a default value for 'total' in case it is 'None'. We can use the value of 'n' as a default total if 'total' is 'None'.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function incorporating the default value for 'total':

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
        unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
        postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    
    if total is None:
        total = n
    
    # rest of the function code...
```

By providing a default value for 'total' in case it is 'None', we can ensure that the multiplication operation on 'total' does not cause a TypeError.
