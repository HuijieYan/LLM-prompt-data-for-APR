The error occurs in the `format_meter` method of the `tqdm` class. The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError` when trying to multiply `total` by `unit_scale`.

The bug occurs because the `total` is being mutated within the function, which can cause unexpected behavior, especially when the function is used in a loop. It is not recommended to mutate input parameters within a function unless it is explicitly intended.

To fix the bug, the `total` should be assigned to a new variable before any mutation is performed. This will prevent unintended side effects.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_meter` method:

```python
    @staticmethod
    def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                     unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                     postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
        # sanity check: total
        total_value = total  # Assign total to a new variable before mutation
        if total_value and n > total_value:
            total_value = None

        # apply custom scale if necessary
        if unit_scale and unit_scale not in (True, 1):
            total_value *= unit_scale  # Use total value instead of total

        # ... rest of the code remains unchanged ...
```

By assigning the `total` parameter to a new variable (`total_value`), we avoid mutating the original `total` value and prevent unexpected behavior in the function.
