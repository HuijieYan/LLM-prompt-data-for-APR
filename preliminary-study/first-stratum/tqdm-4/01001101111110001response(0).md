The potential error location within the problematic function is the calculation for total when unit_scale is applied.

The error occurs because the code attempts to multiply the 'total' by 'unit_scale' without first checking whether 'total' is None. This leads to a 'TypeError' when the code attempts to perform the multiplication operation on 'None'.

To fix the bug, the code should include a check to ensure that 'total' is not None before applying the 'unit_scale'.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):

    if total is not None:  # Check if total is not None
        if unit_scale and unit_scale not in (True, 1):
            total *= unit_scale
            n *= unit_scale
            if rate:
                rate *= unit_scale  # by default rate = 1 / self.avg_time
            unit_scale = False

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    ...
```

This fix ensures that the 'total' is not None before applying the 'unit_scale' operation, preventing the TypeError that occurred in the previous version of the function.
