The error is occurring due to the attempt to modify the 'total' variable inside the @staticmethod function `format_meter()` at line 77. This modification is not allowed in Python as the 'total' variable is not defined as a non-local variable. This causes a TypeError.

To fix this issue, we can modify the logic of the function to avoid modifying the 'total' variable. We can use a new variable to store the scaled value of 'total' instead.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    """
    Return a string-based progress bar given some parameters
    (function's docstring here)
    """

    # sanity check: total
    if total and n > total:
        total_checked = None
    else:
        total_checked = total

    # apply custom scale if necessary
    if unit_scale and unit_scale not in (True, 1):
        scaled_total = total * unit_scale
        scaled_n = n * unit_scale
        if rate:
            rate *= unit_scale  # by default rate = 1 / self.avg_time
        unit_scale = False
    else:
        scaled_total = total
        scaled_n = n

    # (remaining code remains the same...)

    # rest of the function...
```

With this correction, the 'total' variable is not modified directly, avoiding the TypeError. Instead, a new variable 'total_checked' is used to store the modified value of 'total' based on the condition, and a new variable 'scaled_total' is used to store the scaled value of 'total' if necessary.
