The error message indicates a TypeError at the line `total *= unit_scale`, which means the `total` variable is of type `None` when it should be an integer. This is likely caused by the `sanity check: total` block where `total` is being set to `None` if it's smaller than `n`. This logic is causing issues when `total` is set to `None` and then used in calculations.

To fix this, we need to restructure the logic for handling `total`, which should be set to `None` only if it's smaller than or equal to `n` and also make sure `total` is not `None` before performing any operations on it.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_meter` function after the bug fix:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    
    # sanity check: total
    if total is not None and n > total:
        total = None

    if unit_scale and unit_scale not in (True, 1):
        if total is not None:
            total *= unit_scale
        n *= unit_scale
        if rate:
            rate *= unit_scale

    # rest of the code remains unchanged
```

By making these changes, we ensure that `total` is not set to `None` if it's actually not `None`, and we only perform the scaling operation if `total` is not `None`.
