1. The test case is trying to test the progress bar for a situation where the total number of iterations is unknown. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the `total` parameter and the `unit_scale` parameter when `unit_scale` is not `True` or `1`.

2. The potential error location is within the `format_meter` function at the line `total *= unit_scale`.

3. The bug occurs because the `total` variable might be set as `None` in the `sanity check` block. Later on, when `unit_scale` is applied, it tries to multiply `None` with an integer, resulting in a `TypeError`.

4. To fix the bug, you can add a check to ensure that `total` is not `None` before applying `unit_scale` to it. Additionally, when `total` is `None`, `total_fmt` should be set to `None` as well to avoid any further issues.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `format_meter` function:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    """
    Return a string-based progress bar given some parameters
    (rest of the docstring remains unchanged)
    """

    format_sizeof = format_sizeof  # where format_sizeof is a relative function in this class
    format_interval = format_interval  # where format_interval is a relative function in this class
    
    # sanity check: total
    if total and n > total:
        total = None
    
    # apply custom scale if necessary
    if total is not None and unit_scale and unit_scale not in (True, 1):
        total *= unit_scale
        n *= unit_scale
        if rate:
            rate *= unit_scale  # by default rate = 1 / self.avg_time
        unit_scale = False
    else:
        total_fmt = None

    # rest of the code remains unchanged
```

In the corrected function, an additional check is added to ensure that `total` is not `None` before applying `unit_scale` to it. Moreover, when `total` is `None`, `total_fmt` is also set as `None` to avoid any issues related to `total` being `None`.
