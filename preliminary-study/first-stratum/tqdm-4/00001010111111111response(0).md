The error message indicates a TypeError on line 136 of the `format_meter` function, specifically involving the line `total *= unit_scale`. This indicates that the `total` variable is of type `None`, which is not compatible with the `*=` operation.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the `total` value is set to `None` under certain conditions, and subsequently, the `*=` operation is attempted on a `None` type, leading to a TypeError.

To fix the bug, we should check whether the `total` value is `None` before performing any operations that may be incompatible with it. One possible approach to fix the bug is to add a check for `None` before the `*=` operation and handle it accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_meter` function:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):

    # sanity check: total
    if total and n > total:
        total = None

    # apply custom scale if necessary
    if unit_scale and unit_scale not in (True, 1):
        if total is not None:
            total *= unit_scale
        n *= unit_scale
        if rate:
            rate *= unit_scale  # by default rate = 1 / self.avg_time
        unit_scale = False
    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

In this corrected code, `total *= unit_scale` is wrapped in a check for `None` before being executed. If `total` is not `None`, then the `*=` operation will be performed, otherwise, it will be skipped.
