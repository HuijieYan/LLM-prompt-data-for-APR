The error message indicates that the issue is occurring when trying to multiply `total` by `unit_scale`. However, it's encountering a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *=: 'NoneType' and 'int'`. This means that `total` is `None`, which is not a valid type to perform multiplication with an integer.

The potential error location is identified at the line:
```python
total *= unit_scale
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that `total` is being set to `None` in the `sanity check` condition when `total` exists and `n` is greater than `total`. 

One possible approach to fixing this bug is to reassign `total` to `None` after the sanity check condition rather than altering its value directly. Another approach could involve not setting `total` to `None` within the sanity check and handling it separately.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    """
    Return a string-based progress bar given some parameters

    ... (other comments and documentation)

    # sanity check: total
    if total and n > total:
        total = None

    # apply custom scale if necessary
    if unit_scale and unit_scale not in (True, 1):
        total_scaled = total * unit_scale
        n *= unit_scale
        if rate:
            rate *= unit_scale  # by default rate = 1 / self.avg_time
        unit_scale = False
        total = total_scaled

    ... (rest of the code)
``` 

In the corrected code, we store the scaled `total` in a new variable `total_scaled` and then reassign the value of `total` to `total_scaled`. This way, the original `total` value is preserved and used for any remaining calculations or comparisons.
