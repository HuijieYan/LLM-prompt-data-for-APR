The error occurred due to the attempt to perform a multiplication operation on a variable that was originally set to `None`, which is not a valid operand for multiplication.

To fix this bug, you need to ensure that the `total` variable is not of type `None` before using it in the subsequent calculations. This can be achieved by adding a check to verify the non-emptiness of the `total` variable before performing any operations on it.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_meter` function:

```python
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):

    # sanity check: total
    if total is not None and n > total:
        total = None

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    format_interval = tqdm.format_interval
    elapsed_str = format_interval(elapsed)
    # ... (further code remains unchanged)

    # if total is None: no progressbar, ETA, just progress stats
    if total is not None:
        # ... (further code remains unchanged)
        return l_bar + full_bar + r_bar
    else:
        return ((prefix + ": ") if prefix else '') + \
            '{0}{1} [{2}, {3}{4}]'.format(
                n_fmt, unit, elapsed_str, rate_fmt, postfix)
```

By adding the condition `if total is not None` before using the `total` variable, we ensure that the multiplication operation is only performed when the `total` variable is not `None`, thus fixing the bug.
