1. The test case is testing the `format_meter` function with the `total` parameter set to `None`. The error message indicates that the issue is with the `total *= unit_scale` line.

2. The potential error location is identified as the `total *= unit_scale` line within the `format_meter` function.

3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that when `total` is `None`, it cannot be multiplied by the `unit_scale` which results in a `TypeError`.

4. To fix the bug, we can check if `total` is not `None` before performing the multiplication with `unit_scale`. If `total` is `None`, we can simply continue with the remaining calculations without changing it.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `format_meter` function:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    """
    Return a string-based progress bar given some parameters

    ... (other parameters and docstring remain the same) ...

    """
    
    # sanity check: total
    if total is not None and n > total:  # Check if total is not None
        total = None

    # apply custom scale if necessary
    if unit_scale and unit_scale not in (True, 1) and total is not None:  # Check if total is not None
        total *= unit_scale
        n *= unit_scale
        if rate:
            rate *= unit_scale  # by default rate = 1 / self.avg_time
        unit_scale = False

    # Remaining code remains the same
```

By making these changes, the `TypeError` that occurs when `total` is `None` and gets multiplied by `unit_scale` will be eliminated.
