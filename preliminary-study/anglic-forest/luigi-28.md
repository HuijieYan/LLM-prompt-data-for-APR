You are going to repair the following buggy python program.    

```python
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
         if partition is None:
             stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

             return stdout and table in stdout
         else:
             stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                 (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```
 
The values of variables before the snippet: (TEST CASE 1)
database: "default", partition: None, stdout: "OK", table: "mytable"
The expected values of variables after the snippet:
returned: False

The values of variables before the snippet: (TEST CASE 2)
database: "default", partition: None, stdout: 'OK\nmytable', table: "mytable"
The expected values of variables after the snippet:
returned: True

The values of variables before the snippet: (TEST CASE 3)
database: "default", partition: None, stdout: 'OK\nmytable', table: "MyTable"
The values of variables before the snippet: (TEST CASE 3)
returned: True

Can you explain the thought process for choosing the correct snippet step by step and validate it against these test cases. 

# response

Sure, let's go through the code snippet step by step and see how it can be corrected and then validate it against the provided test cases.

Test Case 1:

Database: "default"
Partition: None
Stdout: "OK"
Table: "mytable"
Expected: returned = False
Test Case 2:

Database: "default"
Partition: None
Stdout: "OK\nmytable"
Table: "mytable"
Expected: returned = True
Test Case 3:

Database: "default"
Partition: None
Stdout: "OK\nmytable"
Table: "MyTable"
Expected: returned = True
Let's analyze the original code snippet:

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                 (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False

The code has several issues:

In the first branch (when partition is None), it runs a Hive command to show tables but doesn't handle the case where the table name is not found properly.
In the second branch (when partition is not None), it runs a Hive command to show partitions but doesn't check the existence of the partition properly.
The code doesn't handle case sensitivity for table names.
Let's fix these issues step by step:

Case Sensitivity: We need to handle case sensitivity for table names. To do this, we can convert both the table variable and the table names retrieved from Hive to lowercase and then compare them.

Handle Hive Command Output:

In the first branch (when partition is None), we should check if the table name is in the stdout properly.
In the second branch (when partition is not None), we should check if the stdout contains any data, indicating that the partition exists.
Here's the corrected code:

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        table = table.lower()  # Convert table name to lowercase for case insensitivity
    
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout.lower()  # Convert stdout to lowercase for comparison
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                 (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)  # Check if stdout has any data (partition exists)

Now, let's validate the corrected code against the test cases:

Test Case 1:

Database: "default"

Partition: None

Stdout: "OK"

Table: "mytable"

Expected: returned = False

Explanation: In this case, the table name "mytable" is not found in the stdout, which is "OK." Therefore, the function should return False.

Test Case 2:

Database: "default"

Partition: None

Stdout: "OK\nmytable"

Table: "mytable"

Expected: returned = True

Explanation: In this case, the table name "mytable" is found in the stdout, which is "OK\nmytable." Therefore, the function should return True.

Test Case 3:

Database: "default"

Partition: None

Stdout: "OK\nmytable"

Table: "MyTable"

Expected: returned = True

Explanation: In this case, the table name "MyTable" (with different casing) is found in the stdout, which is "OK\nmytable" after converting to lowercase. Therefore, the function should return True.

The corrected code should produce the expected results for these test cases.
