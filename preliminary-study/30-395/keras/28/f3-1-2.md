The issue description is:

I found this new method very useful, but it seems to be that we are loosing 2 data points and lack of some functionality. Main problem was splitting the data for train and test as it become non trivial issue. So I've made a function, which has the same constructor as TSGen and also test_size. Moreover, sometimes it may be useful to see what our generated batches are, but we can only see 1 item. So I've added slicing functionality for batches. I'm not sure if it deserve a pool request and absolutely sure it may be done in another way but this worked for me. So want a little bit of discussion

Maybe I'm a noob and made useless thing
