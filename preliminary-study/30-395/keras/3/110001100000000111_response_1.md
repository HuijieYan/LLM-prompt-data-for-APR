The issue arises from the `clone_model` function in `keras.models.py` file. The error message "Could not compute output Tensor" indicates that there is an issue with computing the output tensors during the cloning process.

The potential error location within the function is in the part where it handles the output tensors and masks. The issue seems to be related to a specific scenario where the `Lambda` layer is used and does not support output masks. This causes the `output_masks` to always be `[None]`, leading to the error.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to handle the case where the `Lambda` layer does not support output masks. One possible approach is to check for the presence of masks in the output_tensors and handle the scenario accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `clone_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (existing code)

    # Iterate over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    depth_keys = list(model._nodes_by_depth.keys())
    depth_keys.sort(reverse=True)
    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # ... (existing code)

            # If all previous input tensors are available in tensor_map,
            # then call node.inbound_layer on them.
            computed_data = []  # List of tuples (input, mask).
            all_computed = True
            for x in reference_input_tensors:
                if x in tensor_map:
                    computed_data.append(tensor_map[x])
                else:
                    all_computed = False

            if all_computed:
                # Call layer.
                if node.arguments:
                    kwargs = node.arguments
                else:
                    kwargs = {}
                # ... (existing code)

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs,
    # then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        if x in tensor_map:
            tensor, _ = tensor_map[x]
            output_tensors.append(tensor)
        else:
            raise AssertionError('Could not compute output ' + str(x))
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

This corrected code includes a check to ensure that all output tensors are computed before creating the new model. If any output tensor is not computed, it raises an `AssertionError` indicating the issue.
