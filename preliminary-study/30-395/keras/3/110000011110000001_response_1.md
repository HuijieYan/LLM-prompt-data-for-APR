The error occurs when trying to clone a functional model with multiple inputs and outputs. The current implementation of the `_clone_functional_model` has several issues related to handling multiple input and output tensors.

The problematic function is failing at the assertion where it checks if all the model outputs were computed successfully.

The issues in the current implementation are:
1. The code that creates placeholders when `input_tensors` is `None` is problematic and doesn't correctly map the input layers to cloned layers.
2. Handling multiple input and output tensors is not adequately implemented.
3. Node and layer mapping is not working correctly for the given model.
4. The logic of collecting and updating the tensor map is not functioning as intended.

To fix the issues, the `_clone_functional_model` function needs to be refactored to handle multiple input and output tensors correctly. The logic for creating placeholders and mapping layers and tensors should be revisited.

Here's the corrected implementation of the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input

def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # (Unchanged code here...)
    # ...

    if input_tensors is None:
        # Create placeholders to build the model on top of.
        input_tensors = [Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape,
                               dtype=layer.dtype,
                               sparse=layer.sparse,
                               name=layer.name) for layer in model.input]
        layer_map = {layer: new_input for layer, new_input in zip(model.input, input_tensors)}

    else:
        input_tensors = input_tensors
        layer_map = {}

    tensor_map = dict(zip(model.input, input_tensors))

    # Iterated over every layer in the model, creating new layers.
    for layer in model.layers:
        config = layer.get_config()
        cloned_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(config)
        layer_map[layer] = cloned_layer

    # Apply layer transformations on tensors
    for layer in model.layers:
        clone_layer = layer_map[layer]
        new_input_tensors = [tensor_map[t] for t in layer.input]
        new_output_tensors = to_list(clone_layer(new_input_tensors))

        for input_tensor, new_output_tensor in zip(layer.output, new_output_tensors):
            tensor_map[input_tensor] = new_output_tensor

    # Create a new model with the modified input and output tensors
    output_tensors = [tensor_map[tensor] for tensor in model.output]
    new_model = Model(inputs=input_tensors, outputs=output_tensors)

    return new_model
```

In this corrected function:
1. Handling of `input_tensors` and the creation of placeholders have been improved.
2. Input and output tensors mapping are correctly handled, including the transformation of tensors through layers.
3. The creation of a new model with modified input and output tensors is done at the end.
