The bug occurs because the condition `if not isinstance(model, Model)` in the `_clone_functional_model` function is raising a `ValueError`. This happens because the `model` being passed to the function is a functional `Model` instance, but due to incorrect checking conditions, the function assumes it's a `Sequential` instance.

The bug arises from the incorrect use of condition checks for the input model type. To fix this, we need to modify the way we check the type of the input model.

We can replace the condition `if not isinstance(model, Model)` with the following: 
```python
if not isinstance(model, keras.engine.training.Model)
```
And the condition `if isinstance(model, Sequential)` with the following:
```python
if isinstance(model, keras.models.Sequential)
```
This will ensure that the correct type checks are performed. 

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    """Clone a functional `Model` instance.
    ... (rest of the docstring remains unchanged) ...    
    """
    if not isinstance(model, keras.engine.training.Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, keras.models.Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers.
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}
    
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged from here
```

By ensuring the correct type checks, we can address the issue and prevent the erroneous `ValueError` being raised.
