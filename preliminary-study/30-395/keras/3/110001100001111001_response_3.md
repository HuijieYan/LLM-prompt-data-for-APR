The error in the provided code seems to be related to the way the input layers and tensors are being handled during the cloning process of the Functional Model. The bug may be occurring due to incorrect mappings and handling of input layers/tensors along with issues in the layer cloning process.

The code attempts to clone a functional `Model` instance which involves creating new layers and weights. The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of input layers, input tensors, and the layer cloning process.

To fix the bug, it is essential to correctly map the input layers and tensors, ensure proper creation of input placeholders if they are not provided, and handle the layer cloning process with appropriate configurations.

Here's the corrected code for the provided function:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras import Input

def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
  
    input_layers = model.layers
    if input_tensors is None:
        input_tensors = [Input(batch_input_shape=layer.input_shape,
                               dtype=layer.input.dtype,
                               sparse=layer.sparse,
                               name=layer.name) for layer in input_layers]

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers.

    for layer, input_tensor in zip(input_layers, input_tensors):
        layer_map[layer] = input_tensor

    for layer in model.layers:
        if layer not in layer_map:
            # Clone layer.
            new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
            layer_map[layer] = new_layer

    # Create new input layers using provided input tensors.
    new_input_layers = [layer_map[layer] for layer in model.layers]

    # Create new instances of layers and clone them.
    new_layers = [layer_map[layer] for layer in model.layers]

    # Instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    input_tensors = [layer.output for layer in layer_map.values()]
    output_tensors = [layer.output for layer in new_layers]
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```
