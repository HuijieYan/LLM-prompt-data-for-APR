The error occurs when the `clone_model` method is called on a model that has a layer without mask support and multiple output tensors. This results in the error "Could not compute output Tensor".

The potential error location within the function is in the section where it computes the output masks for the layers. Specifically, the issue seems to be with the line `output_masks = to_list(layer.compute_mask(computed_tensors, computed_masks))`, where the `compute_mask` method of a layer that does not support masks returns `None`. This results in the `output_masks` being set to a list containing only `None`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `clone_model` method is not handling layers without mask support and multiple output tensors correctly, which leads to incorrect behavior when computing output masks.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to check if the layer supports masks before attempting to compute the masks. If the layer does not support masks, the `output_masks` should be set to a list of `None` values, corresponding to the number of output tensors.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected function to fix the bug
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (existing function code)

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    # Iterated over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    depth_keys = list(model._nodes_by_depth.keys())
    depth_keys.sort(reverse=True)
    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # ... (existing function code)

            # If all previous input tensors are available in tensor_map,
            # then call node.inbound_layer on them.
            computed_data = []  # List of tuples (input, mask).
            for x in reference_input_tensors:
                if x in tensor_map:
                    computed_data.append(tensor_map[x])

            if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
                # Call layer and compute masks if the layer supports it.
                if node.arguments:
                    kwargs = node.arguments
                else:
                    kwargs = {}

                computed_tensors = [x[0] for x in computed_data]

                # Check if layer supports masks
                if has_arg(layer.compute_mask, 'inputs') and has_arg(layer.compute_mask, 'mask'):
                    computed_masks = [x[1] for x in computed_data]
                    output_masks = to_list(layer.compute_mask(computed_tensors, computed_masks))
                else:
                    output_masks = [None] * len(reference_output_tensors)

                # Update tensor_map with computed output masks.
                for x, y, mask in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors, output_masks):
                    tensor_map[x] = (y, mask)

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs,
    # then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)
        tensor, mask = tensor_map[x]
        output_tensors.append(tensor)
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

In the corrected code, before computing the masks for the output tensors, it checks if the layer supports masks. If the layer supports masks, it computes the masks as before. If the layer does not support masks, it sets the `output_masks` to a list of `None` values, corresponding to the number of output tensors. This ensures that the function handles layers without mask support and multiple output tensors correctly.
