The error message indicates that the assertion `assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)` failed, which means that the output tensor `x` from the `model` could not be computed. This could be due to an issue in the logic for computing the output tensors when cloning the model.

The potential error location within the `_clone_functional_model` function is likely in the logic for computing the output tensors within the loop that iterates over nodes in the reference model. Specifically, the computation of the output tensors and updating the tensor map might be flawed.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be an issue with how the output tensors are being computed and updated in the `tensor_map` within the function. It is possible that the logic for computing the output tensors and updating the map is not handling certain cases correctly, leading to the assertion failure.

To fix this bug, the logic for computing the output tensors and updating the `tensor_map` needs to be carefully reviewed and potentially revised. It is important to ensure that all edge cases and scenarios are handled correctly when cloning the model and computing the output tensors.

Here is the corrected code for the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (same docstring as before)
    
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ' + str(model))
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead: ' + str(model))

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers.
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}
    if input_tensors is None:
        # Create placeholders to build the model on top of.
        input_tensors = [Input(batch_shape=layer.input_shape) for layer in model.layers if isinstance(layer, InputLayer)]
    else:
        input_tensors = to_list(input_tensors)

    for original_tensor, input_tensor in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[original_tensor] = (input_tensor, None)  # tensor, mask

    # Iterated over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    for layer in model.layers:
        if layer not in layer_map:
            # Clone layer.
            new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
            layer_map[layer] = new_layer

    for node in model._nodes_by_depth:
        input_tensors = [tensor_map[tensor][0] for tensor in node.input_tensors]
        output_tensors = layer_map[node.outbound_layer](input_tensors)  # Call the new layer

        for original_tensor, output_tensor in zip(node.output_tensors, output_tensors):
            tensor_map[original_tensor] = (output_tensor, None)

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs,
    # then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = [tensor_map[tensor][0] for tensor in model.outputs]
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

This corrected code simplifies the logic for cloning the functional model and computing the output tensors. It properly handles the input tensors and iterates through the model layers to clone them and compute the output tensors.
