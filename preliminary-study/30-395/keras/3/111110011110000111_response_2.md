The test case `test_clone_functional_model_with_multi_outputs` involves creating a functional Keras model with multiple input and output tensors, and then attempts to clone the model using the `clone_model` function. The error message indicates that the cloning process is not able to compute the output tensor for the cloned model.

The potential error location is within the `_clone_functional_model` function, specifically in the part where it iterates over the nodes in the reference model, handles the creation of new layers, and computes the output tensors.

The bug is occurring because the function does not properly handle the scenario of cloning a functional model with multiple outputs, especially when the layers involved do not support mask computation. This results in the failure to compute the output tensor for the cloned model.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to properly handle the creation of new layers, computation of output tensors, and handling of multiple inputs and outputs in a functional model, especially when mask support is not present for certain layers.

Below is the corrected code for the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # (Code for input validation remains unchanged)

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers.
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}
    
    # (Code for creating placeholders remains unchanged)

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    for depth in reversed(range(len(model.layers))):
        layer = model.layers[depth]

        if layer not in layer_map:
            new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
            layer_map[layer] = new_layer
            layer = new_layer
        else:
            layer = layer_map[layer]
            if isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
                continue

        reference_input_tensors = layer.input
        reference_output_tensors = layer.output

        computed_data = []  # List of tuples (input, mask).
        for x in reference_input_tensors:
            if x in tensor_map:
                computed_data.append(tensor_map[x])

        if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
            if layer._compute_mask:
                computed_tensors = [x[0] for x in computed_data]
                computed_masks = [x[1] for x in computed_data]
                kwargs = {}
                if len(computed_data) > 1 and 'mask' in layer.call_args:
                    kwargs['mask'] = computed_masks
                output_tensors = layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs)
                for x, y in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors):
                    tensor_map[x] = (y, None)

    output_tensors = [tensor_map[x][0] for x in model.output]
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

In the corrected code:
- The iteration over the layers is done in reverse order to ensure correct handling of the layer dependencies.
- The layer's input, output, and mask computation properties are used to appropriately handle the computation of output tensors.
- The output tensors are correctly stored in the `tensor_map`.

These corrections should address the issue and allow the cloning process for functional models with multi-outputs to work as expected.
