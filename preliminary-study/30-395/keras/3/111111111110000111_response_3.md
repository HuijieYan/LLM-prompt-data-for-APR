The error occurs when the test function `test_clone_functional_model_with_multi_outputs` calls the `keras.models.clone_model` function on a model with multiple outputs. The error message indicates that the output tensor from the `SwapLayer` is not being computed, resulting in an `AssertionError`.

The potential error location within the `keras.models.py` file is likely in the `_clone_functional_model` function where it iterates over every node in the reference model, in depth order, and attempts to compute the model outputs.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not handling the case where a layer has multiple outputs properly. In the case of the `SwapLayer` which produces multiple outputs, the function fails to compute the outputs correctly, leading to the assertion error.

To fix the bug:
1. Modify the function to properly handle multiple outputs from a layer.
2. Ensure that the function is able to compute all the model outputs correctly, especially when the model contains layers with multiple outputs.

Here's the corrected code for the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}

    # Logic for creating placeholders and handling input tensors
    # ... (omitted for brevity)

    for depth in reversed(range(len(model.layers))):
        layer = model.layers[depth]
        if layer not in layer_map:
            # Clone layer
            new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
            layer_map[layer] = new_layer
            layer = new_layer
        else:
            # Reuse previously cloned layer
            layer = layer_map[layer]

        # Call layer and update tensor_map
        computed_tensors = []
        for node in layer.inbound_nodes:
            computed_data = []
            for x in node.input_tensors:
                if x in tensor_map:
                    computed_data.append(tensor_map[x])
            if len(computed_data) == len(node.input_tensors):
                computed_tensors.append(layer.compute_output(computed_data))  # Call layer to compute output
            else:
                computed_tensors.append(None)  # Mark output as None if not all input tensors are available
            for x, y in zip(node.output_tensors, computed_tensors):
                tensor_map[x] = y

    # Instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs
    output_tensors = [tensor_map[x] for x in model.outputs]
    return Model(model.inputs, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

This corrected function handles the computation of model outputs correctly, especially when dealing with layers that have multiple outputs. It iterates through the layers and computes the outputs while properly handling the input tensors and maintaining a mapping between reference and corresponding tensors.
