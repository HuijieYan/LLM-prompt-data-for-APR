The potential error in the provided function is the incorrect identification of the model type. The function is checking if the input `model` is an instance of `Model` or `Sequential` from the Keras library, but this check is not being performed correctly.

The bug occurs because the code does not handle the case if the `model` is not an instance of either `Model` or `Sequential`, which can lead to unexpected errors or behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to properly identify the type of the `model` by using the `isinstance` function for both `Model` and `Sequential` classes separately. Additionally, proper error messages should be raised when the `model` is not an instance of `Model` or `Sequential`.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Import the necessary classes from Keras library
from keras.models import Model, Sequential
from keras.layers import Input, InputLayer

def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # Properly check if the input model is an instance of Model or Sequential
    if not isinstance(model, (Model, Sequential)):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` or `Sequential` instance, got ', model)

    # Rest of the function remains the same...
    # ...
```
