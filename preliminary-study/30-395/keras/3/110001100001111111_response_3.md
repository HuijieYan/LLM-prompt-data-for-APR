The bug is likely occurring within the `_clone_functional_model` function in the Keras library. The error message "Could not compute output Tensor" implies that there is an issue with computing the output tensors in the `clone_model` method.

Upon analyzing the code, it seems that the bug is related to the handling of multi-output layers without mask support. This issue arises because the `compute_mask` method always returns `None` for layers that don't support masks, such as the Lambda layer. This causes the `output_masks` list to contain only `None` values, which leads to the error message.

To fix this bug, one approach could be to modify the logic for handling layers without mask support. Instead of relying on the `compute_mask` method, a check could be implemented to handle the case where the layer does not support masks. This could involve directly setting the output mask to `None` if the layer does not support masks.

Here's the corrected code for the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (existing code)

    # Iterated over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    depth_keys = list(model._nodes_by_depth.keys())
    depth_keys.sort(reverse=True)
    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # Recover the corresponding layer.
            layer = node.outbound_layer

            # Get or create layer.
            if layer not in layer_map:
                # Clone layer.
                new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
                layer_map[layer] = new_layer
                layer = new_layer
            else:
                # Reuse previously cloned layer.
                layer = layer_map[layer]
                # Don't call InputLayer multiple times.
                if isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
                    continue
                
            # Gather inputs to call the new layer.
            reference_input_tensors = node.input_tensors
            reference_output_tensors = node.output_tensors

            # If all previous input tensors are available in tensor_map,
            # then call node.inbound_layer on them.
            computed_data = []  # List of tuples (input, mask).
            for x in reference_input_tensors:
                if x in tensor_map:
                    computed_data.append(tensor_map[x])

            if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
                # Call layer.
                if node.arguments:
                    kwargs = node.arguments
                else:
                    kwargs = {}
                if len(computed_data) == 1:
                    computed_tensor, computed_mask = computed_data[0]
                    output_tensors = to_list(
                        layer(computed_tensor, **kwargs))
                else:
                    computed_tensors = [x[0] for x in computed_data]
                    output_tensors = to_list(
                        layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs))
                # Update tensor_map.
                for x, y in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors):
                    tensor_map[x] = y

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs,
    # then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)
        tensor = tensor_map[x]
        output_tensors.append(tensor)
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

In this corrected code, the handling of masks for multi-output layers without mask support has been adjusted to ensure that the output tensors are computed correctly. This should resolve the issue of the "Could not compute output Tensor" error when using `clone_model`.
