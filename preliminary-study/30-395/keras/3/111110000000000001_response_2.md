Potential Error Location: The function does not properly handle the case when the provided model argument is a Sequential model, which is causing the ValueError to be raised.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function is expecting an instance of a functional `Model`, but if a `Sequential` model is provided, it raises a ValueError.

Possible Approaches to Fix the Bug:
1. Check the type of the `model` argument and handle the case for `Sequential` models separately.
2. Raise a specific error message explaining that only functional `Model` instances are supported.
3. Update the function to either convert the `Sequential` model to a functional model or reject it as an invalid argument.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    """Clone a functional `Model` instance.

    Model cloning is similar to calling a model on new inputs,
    except that it creates new layers (and thus new weights) instead
    of sharing the weights of the existing layers.

    # Arguments
        model: Instance of `Model`.
        input_tensors: optional list of input tensors
            to build the model upon. If not provided,
            placeholders will be created.

    # Returns
        An instance of `Model` reproducing the behavior
        of the original model, on top of new inputs tensors,
        using newly instantiated weights.

    # Raises
        ValueError: in case of invalid `model` argument value.
    """
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
        
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers.
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}
    
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged as it handles the cloning of the functional `Model`.
