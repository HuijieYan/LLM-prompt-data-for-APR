The error occurs in the `test_clone_functional_model_with_multi_outputs` test case, specifically in the `keras.models.clone_model` function. The test is designed to create a model, clone it, and then compare the predictions of the original and cloned models. However, during the cloning process, an error is raised, indicating that the output tensor for a specific layer cannot be computed.

The bug within the `_clone_functional_model` function seems to be in the section where it iterates over the nodes of the model and tries to clone layers. This is a complex part of the code where layers and their inputs/outputs are manipulated. It appears that the issue arises from not correctly updating the `tensor_map` for the output tensors, leading to the failure to compute certain output tensors during the model cloning process.

To fix this bug, the `tensor_map` should be updated correctly when computing the model outputs. This involves ensuring that the output tensors are correctly mapped to their corresponding input tensors during the iteration over the nodes of the model.

Here's the corrected code for the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (function documentation and initial checks)

    # ... (existing code for handling input_tensors and placeholders)

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask
    
    # Iterate over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    depth_keys = list(model._nodes_by_depth.keys())
    depth_keys.sort(reverse=True)
    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # ... (code for recovering and cloning the corresponding layer)

            # ... (code for handling inputs and calling the new layer)

            if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
                # ... (code for calling the layer and updating tensor_map for output tensors)

                # Update tensor_map for output tensors
                for x, y, mask in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors, output_masks):
                    tensor_map[x] = (y, mask)

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs,
    # then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)
        tensor, mask = tensor_map[x]  # Retrieve the computed tensor and mask from tensor_map
        output_tensors.append(tensor)
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

In the corrected code, the `tensor_map` is updated with the computed tensors and masks for the output tensors, ensuring that these mappings are correctly stored and retrieved during the model cloning process. This should address the issue of not being able to compute certain output tensors during model cloning.
