The error occurs when the `clone_model` function is called, which internally calls the `_clone_functional_model` method. The error message indicates that there is an assertion failure when checking whether the output tensor is in the `tensor_map`.

The reason for this bug is that the function is unable to compute the output tensor due to the Lambda layer not supporting masks. This leads to the `output_masks` being `None`, whereas the function expects it to be `[None, None]`. This in turn causes the assertion failure when checking the `tensor_map`.

To fix this bug, the code needs to be modified to handle cases where the `output_masks` are `None` for layers that do not support masks.

Here's the corrected code for the `_clone_functional_model` method:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    """Clone a functional `Model` instance.
    ... (rest of the docstring and arguments remain the same)
    """
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers.
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}

    # Rest of the implementation remains the same, but here's the modification for handling None output_masks

    # Update tensor_map.
    for x, y, mask in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors, output_masks):
        # Check if output_masks is None and replace it with an empty list
        tensor_map[x] = (y, [] if mask is None else mask)

    # Check that we did compute the model output
    for x in model.outputs:
        assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)

    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

In this correction, we handle the case when the `output_masks` are `None` by replacing them with an empty list in the `tensor_map`. This ensures that the assertion check doesn't fail due to the mismatch in `output_masks` and the expected values.
