1. The test case provided is attempting to clone a model using clone_model() and then use multi_gpu_model(). However, when the clone_model() function is used, it raises an AssertionError: Could not compute output error.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the part where it is computing the output tensors and masks. Specifically, in the for loop that iterates over reference_output_tensors and attempts to compute the masks using layer.compute_mask(). 

3. The bug occurs because the layer Lambda does not support using masks, and therefore the output_masks will always be [None]. This leads to the error when attempting to compute the output tensors.

4. To fix the bug, we can modify the code to check if the layer supports masks before attempting to compute them. If the layer does not support masks, we can skip the mask computation step. Additionally, we should also handle the case where the layer has multiple outputs without mask support.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... existing implementation ...
    for node in nodes:
        # ... existing implementation ...
        reference_input_tensors = node.input_tensors
        reference_output_tensors = node.output_tensors

        # If all previous input tensors are available in tensor_map,
        # then call node.inbound_layer on them.
        computed_data = []  # List of tuples (input, mask).
        for x in reference_input_tensors:
            if x in tensor_map:
                computed_data.append(tensor_map[x])

        if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
            # Call layer.
            if node.arguments:
                kwargs = node.arguments
            else:
                kwargs = {}
            computed_tensors = [x[0] for x in computed_data]
            
            if any(has_arg(layer.call, arg) for arg in ['mask', 'mask_arg']):
                computed_masks = [x[1] for x in computed_data]
                kwargs['mask'] = computed_masks
                output_masks = to_list(
                    layer.compute_mask(computed_tensors, computed_masks))
            else:
                output_masks = [None] * len(reference_output_tensors)

            output_tensors = to_list(
                layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs))

            # Update tensor_map.
            for x, y, mask in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors, output_masks):
                tensor_map[x] = (y, mask)
```

This corrected code addresses the issue by checking if the layer supports masks before attempting to compute them and handle the case for multiple outputs without mask support.
