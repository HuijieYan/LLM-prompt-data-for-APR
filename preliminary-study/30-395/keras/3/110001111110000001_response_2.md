The error occurs when trying to clone a functional model with multiple outputs. The function `_clone_functional_model` is not handling this case correctly, which is causing the error.

The error occurs because the function does not handle multiple output tensors correctly when processing the model's nodes. This leads to the `tensor_map` not having the necessary information to compute the model outputs.

To fix this bug, the function `_clone_functional_model` needs to be updated to correctly handle models with multiple outputs. Specifically, the processing of the model's nodes and the updating of the `tensor_map` need to account for multiple output tensors.

Here's the corrected code for the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (existing code)

    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # ... (existing code)

            # If all previous input tensors are available in tensor_map,
            # then call node.inbound_layer on them.
            computed_data = []  # List of tuples (input, mask).
            for x in reference_input_tensors:
                if x in tensor_map:
                    computed_data.append(tensor_map[x])

            if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
                # Call layer.
                if node.arguments:
                    kwargs = node.arguments
                else:
                    kwargs = {}
                computed_tensors = [x[0] for x in computed_data]
                computed_masks = [x[1] for x in computed_data]

                # Update tensor_map.
                for i, (x, y) in enumerate(zip(reference_output_tensors, computed_tensors)):
                    tensor_map[x] = (y, computed_masks[i])

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs,
    # then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)
        tensor, mask = tensor_map[x]
        output_tensors.append(tensor)
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

In the corrected code, the `tensor_map` is updated for each output tensor of the model, and the error check at the end is modified to consider the mapped tensors and masks. This should address the issue with cloning models with multiple outputs.
