The potential error location is in the section where it handles input tensors. It seems to be trying to create placeholder input layers if `input_tensors` is not provided, but there are issues with how it is handling input tensors and creating new input layers.

The bug occurs because the code is not properly handling the creation of input layers and handling input tensors. It is trying to create input layers and their corresponding input tensors, but there are mistakes in the code logic.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the creation of input layers and input tensors, ensuring that the input layers are created correctly and their input tensors are handled appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model, Input

def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if model.__class__.__name__ == 'Sequential':
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    if input_tensors is None:
        input_tensors = [Input(shape=layer.input.shape[1:]) for layer in model.layers if isinstance(layer, InputLayer)]
    
    layer_map = {}
    tensor_map = {}
    for i, layer in enumerate(model.layers):
        if isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
            layer_map[layer] = input_tensors[i]

    for i, layer in enumerate(model.layers):
        if i == 0:
            prev_layer = layer_map.get(layer)
        else:
            prev_layer = layer_map.get(model.layers[i - 1])
        layer_map[layer] = layer(prev_layer)
        tensor_map[layer.output] = layer_map[layer]

    cloned_model = Model(inputs=input_tensors, outputs=tensor_map[model.layers[-1].output])
    return cloned_model
```

In this corrected code, we check if `input_tensors` is provided and create new input layers if not provided. We then iterate through the layers of the model, connecting each layer's input to the output of the previous layer. Finally, we create a new model with the input and output tensors and return the cloned model.
