The error occurs when using the `clone_model` function with a specific model configuration, and it seems to be related to the handling of the layer masks. The error message "Could not compute output Tensor" suggests that there is an issue with computing the output tensor for the cloned model.

Upon analyzing the provided function `_clone_functional_model`, it's evident that the code is trying to clone the input functional model by creating new layers and instantiating new weights instead of sharing the weights of the existing layers. The issue seems to be related to how the layer masks are handled, particularly when using a layer without mask support.

The bug arises from the fact that the `compute_mask` method of certain layers, such as the `Lambda` layer, returns `None` for the output masks. This causes the `to_list` function to generate a list with `None` as the only element, which is not the expected behavior.

To fix this, the code should be modified to handle cases where the layer does not support masks. The following approaches can be considered for fixing the bug:

1. Check if the layer supports masking using the `supports_masking` property, and use a default mask if the layer does not support masking.
2. If the layer does not support masking, handle this case explicitly to avoid generating a list with `None` as the only element.

Here's the corrected code for the `_clone_functional_model` method with the fix applied:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (existing code)

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    # Iterated over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    depth_keys = list(model._nodes_by_depth.keys())
    depth_keys.sort(reverse=True)
    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # Recover the corresponding layer.
            layer = node.outbound_layer

            # Get or create layer.
            if layer not in layer_map:
                # Clone layer.
                new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
                layer_map[layer] = new_layer
                layer = new_layer
            else:
                # Reuse previously cloned layer.
                layer = layer_map[layer]
                # Don't call InputLayer multiple times.
                if isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
                    continue

            # Gather inputs to call the new layer.
            reference_input_tensors = node.input_tensors
            reference_output_tensors = node.output_tensors

            # If all previous input tensors are available in tensor_map,
            # then call node.inbound_layer on them.
            computed_data = []  # List of tuples (input, mask).
            for x in reference_input_tensors:
                if x in tensor_map:
                    computed_data.append(tensor_map[x])

            if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
                # Call layer.
                if node.arguments:
                    kwargs = node.arguments
                else:
                    kwargs = {}
                computed_tensors = [x[0] for x in computed_data]
                computed_masks = [x[1] for x in computed_data]
                output_tensors = to_list(
                    layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs))
                # Update tensor_map.
                for x, y in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors):
                    tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # Assuming no mask support

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs,
    # then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)
        tensor, _ = tensor_map[x]
        output_tensors.append(tensor)
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

In the corrected code, we assume no mask support for the layers that do not explicitly support masking. We handle this case by setting the mask value as `None` when updating the `tensor_map` for these layers. This approach ensures that the code does not generate a list with `None` as the only element, thus addressing the bug.
