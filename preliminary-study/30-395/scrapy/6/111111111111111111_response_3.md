This bug is likely occurring in the `convert_image` function. The error message indicates that the lists of colors in the images are not matching as expected.

The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of images with different formats and modes within the `convert_image` function. When the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA', the function should convert the image to an RGB format with a white background.

To fix this bug, the `convert_image` function should be modified to handle the image format and mode properly. Specifically, when the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', the function should create a new RGB image with a white background and then convert the RGBA image to RGB format.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

With this correction, the `convert_image` function should properly handle images with different formats and modes, ensuring that they are correctly converted and processed. This should resolve the error seen in the test case.
