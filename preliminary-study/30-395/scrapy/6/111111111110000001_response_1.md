The test case is attempting to test the `convert_image` function inside the `ImagesPipeline` class. The error message indicates that the test is failing because the expected and actual color values are not matching.

The issue is likely occurring in the `convert_image` function, specifically in the image conversion logic. The function is supposed to take an input image, convert it to a specific format and size, and return the converted image.

The bug occurs because the function does not correctly handle the RGBA format for PNG images. When the format is PNG and the mode is RGBA, the function attempts to create a new image with a white background and then converts it to RGB. However, the code does not handle transparency properly, which causes the color values to differ between the expected and actual results.

To fix the bug, the `convert_image` function needs to handle RGBA images with transparency correctly. This can be achieved by using the `convert_alpha` method from the `PIL.Image` module to handle PNG images with transparency.

Here's the corrected `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageOps
from io import BytesIO


class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    # ... other methods ...

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            # Use ImageOps.mirror() rather than image.paste()
            image = ImageOps.mirror(image)

        if image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

By using `ImageOps.mirror()` to handle PNG images with transparency, the function should now correctly convert the images and return the expected results, thus resolving the bug.
