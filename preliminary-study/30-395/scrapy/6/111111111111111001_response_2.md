The error message indicates that there is a problem with comparing the colors of the converted images, which suggests that the `convert_image` function is not functioning as intended.

The potential error in the provided `convert_image` method is that it doesn't handle the case where the format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA' correctly. It attempts to convert the image directly to 'RGB' without taking into account the existing transparency. This could lead to color differences when comparing the original and converted images.

One possible approach for fixing this bug is to check for the transparency of the input image. If the input image is in 'PNG' format and has an 'RGBA' mode, the function should create a new background with a white color and then paste the original image onto the white background before converting it to 'RGB'. This ensures that the transparency is preserved during the conversion process.

Here is the corrected `convert_image` method:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageFile
from io import BytesIO

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

With this correction, the `convert_image` function should correctly handle the transparency of 'RGBA' images when converting them to 'RGB', ensuring that the image colors are preserved during the conversion.
