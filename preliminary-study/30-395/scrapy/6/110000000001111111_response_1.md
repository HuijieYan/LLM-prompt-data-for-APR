The buggy function `convert_image` has several issues:
1. The condition to convert an image to 'RGB' when the format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA' is nested inside another condition. This means it will not be executed if the first condition is false.
2. The conversion to 'RGB' is overwritten by a conversion to 'JPEG' format.
3. The function returns both the modified image and the BytesIO object, but the expected output only includes the modified image and BytesIO object. 

To fix the issues, the if-elif structure should be replaced with separate if conditions, and the line that converts the image to 'JPEG' format should be removed. Additionally, the function should only return the modified image and the BytesIO object.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')

    return image, buf
```
