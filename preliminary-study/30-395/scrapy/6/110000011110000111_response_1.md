The error is occurring in the `test_convert_image` function due to a mismatch in the expected and actual values of the images after conversion. The error message indicates that the list of colors in the converted image is different from the expected list of colors.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the conversion of images with transparency ('RGBA' mode) to RGB. The bug is occurring because when converting an RGBA image to RGB, the transparent areas are filled with a default background color, which is white in this case.

A possible approach to fix the bug is to handle the transparency issue by replacing transparent portions of the image with a specified background color before converting it to RGB. This can be done using the `paste` method of the `Image` object.

The corrected code for the `convert_image` function is as follows:
```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None, background_color=(255, 255, 255)):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, background_color)
        background.paste(image, mask=image.split()[3])  # Fill transparent portions with background_color
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```
In the corrected code, we have added the `background_color` parameter to the `convert_image` function, which allows specifying a background color for filling the transparent areas of RGBA images before conversion to RGB. This addresses the transparency issue and should fix the bug.
