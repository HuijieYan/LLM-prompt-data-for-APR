The bug in the `convert_image` method is that it does not handle the case when the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA' correctly. When these conditions are met, the method should convert the image to RGB format and save it as a JPEG image. However, in the current implementation, it does not correctly handle the conversion and pasting of the image.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic for the 'PNG' and 'RGBA' case to correctly convert and save the image as a JPEG. Additionally, we should ensure that the image is copied before thumbnail generation to avoid modifying the original image.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` method:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageFile
from io import BytesIO
from scrapy.pipelines.images import ImagesPipeline

class CustomImagesPipeline(ImagesPipeline):
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            # Convert the RGBA image to RGB
            image = image.convert('RGB')
        
        # Copy the image before thumbnail generation
        image = image.copy()
        
        # Generate the thumbnail with the given size
        if size:
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        
        # Save the image to a buffer as JPEG
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        
        # Reset the file pointer of the buffer
        buf.seek(0)
        
        return image, buf
```

This corrected code properly handles the conversion of PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB and then saves it as a JPEG image. It also ensures that the original image is not modified during thumbnail generation.
