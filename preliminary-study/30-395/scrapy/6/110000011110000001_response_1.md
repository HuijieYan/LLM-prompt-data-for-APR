The error message indicates that there is an issue with the comparison of the values returned by the function `convert_image`. The test case is expecting specific colors after the image conversion, but the function is returning different results.

The potential error location within the `convert_image` function is the conditional block for handling images with mode 'RGBA' and format 'PNG'.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code logic for handling images with mode 'RGBA' and format 'PNG' is incorrect, leading to unexpected results and failing the test cases.

To fix the bug, the conditional block for handling images with mode 'RGBA' and format 'PNG' needs to be updated to correctly handle the conversion and expected results.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageOps, ImageFile
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Create a new RGBA image with a white background
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        # Convert the RGBA image to RGB
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        # Convert other image modes to RGB
        image = ImageOps.grayscale(image).convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    # Save the image as JPEG
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)
    return image, buf
```

With these changes, the `convert_image` function should now correctly handle image conversions and return the expected results, passing the test cases.
