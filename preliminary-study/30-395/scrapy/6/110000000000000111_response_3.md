Potential error location: 
The bug is likely occurring within the 'convert_image' function in the sections where the image format and mode are being checked and modified.

Reasons behind the bug: 
1. The function only handles the cases where the input image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA'. It does not cover other image formats and modes, leading to potential mismatches.
2. The use of 'paste' method may not be correct.

Approach to fix the bug:
1. Check for all image formats and modes, not just 'PNG' and 'RGBA'.
2. Use the 'paste' method correctly to ensure the image is pasted onto the background image.

Corrected code:
```python
from PIL import Image, ImageFile
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, format='JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)
    return image, buf
```
In this corrected code, we removed the check for 'PNG' format and 'RGBA' mode and simply converted the image to 'RGB' mode if it was not already in that mode. We also fixed the 'save' method to explicitly specify the format as 'JPEG' and then return the image and the buffer containing the image data.
