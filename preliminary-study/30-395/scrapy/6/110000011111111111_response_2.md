The bug occurs in the `convert_image` function when dealing with images of mode 'RGBA' and format 'PNG'. The bug is causing the function to incorrectly convert the image and results in a failed assertion in the test case.

The bug occurs in the section of the code where the image mode is checked and handled. If the image mode is 'RGBA' and image format is 'PNG', the function attempts to convert the image to 'RGB' using a white background. However, this conversion appears to result in an incorrect representation of transparent pixels in the image.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to handle the 'RGBA' mode and 'PNG' format differently. We can keep the image in 'RGBA' mode and 'PNG' format, while ensuring that transparent pixels are correctly preserved.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageOps
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # We negate the original if we want to preserve transparency
        image = ImageOps.invert(image)

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In this corrected code, we use the `ImageOps.invert` method to preserve transparency for images with 'RGBA' mode and 'PNG' format. This should fix the bug and result in correct image conversions for the given test cases.
