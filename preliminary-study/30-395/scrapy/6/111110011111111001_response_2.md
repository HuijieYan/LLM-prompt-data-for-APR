The error occurs in the `test_convert_image` function at the assertion `self.assertEquals(converted.getcolors(), [(10000, (205, 230, 255))])`. The error message indicates that the expected list of colors is different from the actual list.

The bug is likely in the `convert_image` method in the `ImagesPipeline` class. The method is converting an image to RGB mode, but the expected color values are not being achieved.

The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of transparency in images when converting to RGB mode. When the input image has transparency (mode: RGBA), the transparent areas are being filled with white, leading to different colors being produced during the `getcolors` method.

To fix the bug, the method should handle transparent images correctly. After creating the background for images with 'PNG' format and 'RGBA' mode, the transparent areas need to be filled correctly before converting the image to 'RGB' mode.

Here's the corrected `convert_image` method:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, mask=image.split()[3])  # Fill transparent areas with white
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```
