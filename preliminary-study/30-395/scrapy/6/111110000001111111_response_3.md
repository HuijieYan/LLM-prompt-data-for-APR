The issue with the `convert_image` method is that it does not handle the case when the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA' properly. The method is supposed to convert the image to RGB format and create a thumbnail when the size is specified.

The bug occurs because the method does not have a proper conditional check for the 'PNG' format and 'RGBA' mode. As a result, it fails to handle this case correctly and may not convert the image to RGB format as intended.

To fix the bug, we can modify the conditional check for the 'PNG' and 'RGBA' case and also add the thumbnail creation logic.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` method:

```python
from io import BytesIO
from PIL import Image

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
        
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

In the corrected code:
1. We changed the conditional check for 'PNG' and 'RGBA' to create a new RGB background and paste the original image onto it. This ensures correct conversion from RGBA to RGB mode.
2. We added the logic to create a thumbnail of the image if the size is specified.
3. The function now returns the modified image and the BytesIO buffer containing the image data.

With these changes, the `convert_image` method should now handle the different cases appropriately and ensure that the image is converted and thumbnail is created correctly.
