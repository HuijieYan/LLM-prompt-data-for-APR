The issue with the provided `convert_image` function is that it assumes the input image is always a `JPEG` or `RGB` image, which is not always the case. The function does not handle the scenario where the input image format is something other than `JPEG` and the mode is not `RGB`. Additionally, the function does not handle the scenario where the input format is `PNG` and the mode is `RGBA`. 

To fix the bug, we need to add conditional checks for different image formats and modes. We should also handle the cases where the input image needs to be converted or processed based on its format and mode.

Here's the corrected `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageOps
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = ImageOps.exif_transpose(image)  # Handle image orientation
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected function:
1. We have added a conditional check for `PNG` format and `RGBA` mode to handle the creation of a new background and conversion to `RGB`.
2. We also added a check for the image mode not being `RGB`, and then converting it to `RGB`.
3. Lastly, we handled the image size based on the input `size` parameter and then saved the image as a JPEG in the BytesIO buffer.

These changes address the issues with the original function and should now handle different image formats and modes correctly.
