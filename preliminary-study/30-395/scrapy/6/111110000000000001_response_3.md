The potential error location within the `convert_image` function is in the `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':` condition. This condition is trying to check if the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA, but the parameter `image` does not seem to be an instance of the `Image` class.

The reason behind the bug is that the `image` parameter is not properly instantiated as an instance of the `Image` class, so the class methods and properties cannot be accessed. Additionally, if the image format is not PNG or the mode is not RGBA, the code will convert the image to RGB, but it's missing the conversion to RGB after pasting it onto a new background.

A possible approach for fixing the bug would be to ensure that the `image` parameter is properly instantiated as an instance of the `Image` class before accessing its methods and properties. Additionally, the code for converting to RGB should be updated accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

# class declaration containing the fixed function
class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    
        
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # the corrected function
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if isinstance(image, Image.Image):
            if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
                background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
                background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
                image = background
            else:
                image = image.convert('RGB')
            
            if size:
                image = image.copy()
                image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

            buf = BytesIO()
            image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
            return image, buf
        else:
            raise ValueError("Invalid image format")
```
