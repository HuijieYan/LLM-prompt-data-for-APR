Potential error location: The potential error in the code is when the image format is PNG and mode is RGBA. In this case, the code is trying to convert the image to RGB format, but the logic used is incorrect and may result in an error.

Reason for the bug: The bug occurs because the `paste` method is incorrectly used to paste the image onto the background.

Approaches to fix the bug:
1. Use the `paste` method with the correct syntax to paste the image onto the background.
2. If the image format is PNG and mode is RGBA, handle the conversion to RGB format in a different way.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    
        
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```
