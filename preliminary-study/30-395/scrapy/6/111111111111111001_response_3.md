The error occurs when the `convert_image` function returns an image object that does not match the expected values. This is evident from the error message that reports the differing color values.

The potential error location in the `convert_image` function is likely within the conditional block that handles PNG images with an RGBA mode.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the conditional block for converting PNG RGBA images to RGB images may not be functioning correctly, leading to differences in color values when compared to the expected values.

To fix the bug, the conditional block for handling PNG RGBA images should be reviewed and modified as necessary to ensure that it correctly converts the images to RGB format with the appropriate color values.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageOps, ImageFile

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implements the image thumbnail generation logic
    """
    # ... omitted code ...

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, image)
            image = background
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = ImageOps.fit(image, size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

In the corrected code:
1. The conditional block for PNG RGBA images now creates a new RGB background and pastes the original image onto it, ensuring that the transparency is replaced with a white background.
2. The image format checks and conversions are streamlined to ensure that the output format and colors match the expected values.
