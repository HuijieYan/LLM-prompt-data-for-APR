The buggy function `convert_image` has a few issues. 

In the first `if` statement, it tries to handle the case when the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA' by creating a new background with a white color and pasting the original image onto it. Then it converts the image to 'RGB'. However, it has a mistake in the line `background.paste(image, image)`, where it tries to paste the image onto itself. This is incorrect and should be `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)`. 

Another issue is that the function always saves the image as a JPEG regardless of its original format, which may cause unexpected behavior.

We can fix the function by:
1. Correcting the paste operation in the first `if` statement.
2. Checking the original image format and saving the image in its original format.
3. Return the BytesIO buffer after saving the image.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, image.format)
    return image, buf
```
