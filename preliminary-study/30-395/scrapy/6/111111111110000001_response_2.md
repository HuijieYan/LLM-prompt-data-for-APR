The error message indicates that the test case is failing at the point where it is comparing the getcolors() of the converted image with an expected value. The expected value is [(10000, (205, 230, 255))] but the actual value is [(10000, (0, 127, 255))]. This indicates that the bug is related to the conversion of the image.

The potential error location within the convert_image() function is in the first if condition where it checks if the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA'. It then creates a new background with white color and pastes the original image on it, converting the image to 'RGB'. However, the code should be checking if the image mode is 'RGBA', not 'RGB'.

The bug occurs because the code is converting the image to 'RGB' even when it is already in 'RGBA' mode, leading to the loss of transparency information and affecting the expected output.

To fix the bug, the code needs to correctly handle images with mode 'RGBA' and 'PNG' format, ensuring that transparency information is preserved. The code also needs to handle images with mode other than 'RGB' more accurately.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageFile
ImageFile.LOAD_TRUNCATED_IMAGES = True  # This is needed for some large PNG images
from io import BytesIO

# ... omitted code ...

# this is the corrected function
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':  # Corrected this condition to handle non-RGB images
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```
