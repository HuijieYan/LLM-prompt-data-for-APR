The error message indicates that the buggy function `convert_image` is not correctly converting the images. Specifically, it is failing to pass the test cases for transparency and conversion to RGB.

Upon analysis, the potential error location within the `convert_image` function appears to be in the conditional check for PNG and RGBA format images. 

The bug is occurring because the function does not handle transparency correctly when the input image is in PNG format and has an RGBA color mode. The function is expected to convert an RGBA image with a transparent background to an RGB image with a white background while maintaining image transparency.

To fix the bug, a possible approach is to modify the conversion logic in the conditional check for PNG and RGBA format images. This will require creating a new RGBA image with a white background and pasting the original image onto it before converting it to an RGB image. Additionally, the existing conversion logic for images with modes other than RGB needs to be modified to ensure correctness.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageFile
from io import BytesIO

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """
    
    # ... omitted code ...
    
    
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, image.split()[-1])  # Paste only the alpha channel
            image = background
        else:
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

This corrected function now correctly handles the transparency of PNG images with an RGBA color mode and converts them to RGB images with a white background.
