The potential error in the code is that when the `image.format` is 'PNG' and `image.mode` is 'RGBA', the code is attempting to convert the image to 'RGB' format using `image = background.convert('RGB')`. However, this line of code is incorrect as it should be `image = background.convert('RGB')`. 

Additionally, there might be an issue with the line `background.paste(image, image)` as it should be `background.paste(image)`.

The bug occurs because the code is trying to paste the image onto the background without specifying the position.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the second parameter from the `paste` method, as well as correcting the `convert` method.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    
        
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```
