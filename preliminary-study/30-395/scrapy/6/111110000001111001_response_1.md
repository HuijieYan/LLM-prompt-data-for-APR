The buggy function `convert_image` is designed to handle image conversion and thumbnail generation. However, there are a few issues in the function that lead to unexpected behaviors.

1. In the buggy function, the conditional check for PNG format and RGBA mode image seems to have an issue. The code within the first conditional block is meant to handle PNG images with RGBA mode, but it may wrongly convert all images to RGB if they are not in RGB mode.

2. The expected behavior of the function is to convert PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB mode, and optionally generate a thumbnail. However, the code does not handle other image formats properly.

To fix the function, we need to:
- Correct the conditional logic to handle PNG images with RGBA mode separately, and ensure that images in other formats or modes are properly handled.
- Ensure that the function returns the correct values based on the input parameters and conditions.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageFile
from io import BytesIO
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic

    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # this is the corrected function
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, image)
            image = background
        else:
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        buf.seek(0)
        return image, buf
```

In the corrected code:
- We explicitly check for PNG format and RGBA mode, and handle the conversion to RGB mode for such images.
- For images in other formats, we directly convert them to RGB mode.
- We return the `image` and `buf` after generating the thumbnail and saving the image to the buffer.
