The potential error in the provided function `convert_image` is that it may produce an error when trying to save the image in JPEG format without specifying the quality level. This can cause the function to break if it is used in a larger application.

To fix this potential issue, we need to add the `quality` parameter to the `image.save` method when saving the image as JPEG. This will ensure that the image is saved with a specified quality level.

Here is the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO
from scrapy.pipelines.images import FilesPipeline

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implements the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
        
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG', quality=90)  # specifying the quality level as 90
        return image, buf
```

In the corrected code, we added the `quality` parameter with a value of 90 to the `image.save` method, ensuring that the image is saved with a specific quality level.
