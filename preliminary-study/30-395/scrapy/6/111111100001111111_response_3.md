The buggy function `convert_image` is supposed to convert the image format and size, and then save the image to a buffer. However, there are a few issues in the function:

1. In the first `if` condition, the function checks if the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'. However, the action taken within this condition seems incorrect. It attempts to create a new image with a white background, paste the original image on the new background, and then convert it to 'RGB'. This logic is incorrect for the given condition.

2. The `image.save` method is used to save the image to a buffer without specifying the format. It should specify the format as 'JPEG' in this case.

To fix the issues in the function, the logic within the first `if` condition and the `image.save` method need to be corrected.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageFile
from io import BytesIO
from scrapy.pipelines.files import FilesPipeline

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf

```

In the corrected code:
1. The logic within the first `if` condition is simplified to just convert the image to 'RGB' if the format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'.
2. The `image.save` method specifies the format as 'JPEG' when saving the image to the buffer.

These corrections address the issues and improve the functionality of the `convert_image` function.
