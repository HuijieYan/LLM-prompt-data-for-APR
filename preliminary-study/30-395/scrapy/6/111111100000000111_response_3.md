Potential error location: The bug may be in the image format conversion logic, where the image is not being saved in the correct format.

Reasons behind the bug:
1. The image format is being converted to JPEG regardless of the original format, which may cause loss of image quality.
2. The code does not handle the case when the image format is already in 'RGB' mode.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the original image format before converting it to another format.
2. Handle the case where the image is already in 'RGB' mode without unnecessary conversion.
3. Save the image in its original format to prevent loss of quality.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO
from scrapy.pipelines.files import FilesPipeline

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic

    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, image.format)
        return image, buf
