The error message indicates a failure in one of the test cases, specifically related to the comparison of the colors of the images after conversion. This suggests that the bug might be in the `convert_image` function's color conversion logic.

It seems that the bug is within the color conversion logic in the `convert_image` function. The function improperly handles the conversion of RGBA images of format `PNG` to RGB images. As a result, the image.getcolors() method returns different color values, leading to the test failure.

To fix the bug, the logic for converting RGBA images of format `PNG` to RGB images should be revised to ensure that the color values are preserved during the conversion.

Here's the corrected `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageFile
from io import BytesIO
from scrapy.pipelines.files import FilesPipeline

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """
    # ... omitted code ...

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            # Preserve transparency by using a white background
            new_image = Image.new("RGBA", image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
            new_image.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            # Convert RGBA to RGB
            image = new_image.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

With these changes, the color values should be preserved correctly during the color conversion process, thus resolving the bug in the `convert_image` function.
