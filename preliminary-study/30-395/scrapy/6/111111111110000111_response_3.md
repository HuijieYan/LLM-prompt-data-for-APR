The error message indicates that the buggy function `convert_image` is not working correctly. The first error is occurring because the 'converted' image does not have the expected colors. This suggests that the image conversion logic is incorrect.

The bug is occurring because of incorrect condition checking and incorrect pasting of the image. The bug is causing the function to return an incorrect image and subsequently failing the test cases.

To fix the bug, the following approach can be taken:
1. Ensure that the format check is case insensitive by converting the format to uppercase before comparison.
2. When pasting the image onto the background, use the `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)` method, which correctly pastes the original image onto the background.
3. Remove unnecessary copying of the image when doing a thumbnail check.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    image_format = image.format.upper()
    if image_format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)  # paste image onto the background at position (0, 0)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With these changes, the `convert_image` function should now work correctly and pass the provided test cases.
