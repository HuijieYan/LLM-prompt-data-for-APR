The error message indicates that there is a problem with the `convert_image` function, specifically with the colors of the images not being converted correctly. 

Upon reviewing the function, it seems that the bug lies in the conditional checks for the image format and mode, and the subsequent conversion of the image. The bug is likely occurring when trying to convert PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB mode.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional checks and image conversions to ensure that PNG images with RGBA mode are converted to RGB mode properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from io import BytesIO
from PIL import Image

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic

    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            # Use a white background with alpha, then paste the image onto the background
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        buf.seek(0)  # Reset the buffer position to the beginning
        return image, buf
```

With this corrected code, the function should properly handle the conversion of PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB mode, and also generate correct thumbnail images.
