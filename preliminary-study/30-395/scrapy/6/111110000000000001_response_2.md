The potential error in the provided function is with the conditional statement checking for the image format and mode. It seems to have a logical flaw that could result in incorrect behavior.

The bug occurs because the conditional statement only checks for PNG format and RGBA mode, and if the condition is not met, it converts the image to RGB mode. This logic does not account for other image formats and modes.

To fix the bug, we can update the conditional statement to handle other image formats and modes. Additionally, we can use the `Image.open` function to open the image before processing it.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def convert_image(self, image_path, size=None):
        with Image.open(image_path) as image:
            if image.mode == 'RGBA':
                background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
                background.paste(image, image)
                image = background.convert('RGB')
            elif image.mode != 'RGB':
                image = image.convert('RGB')

            if size:
                image = image.copy()
                image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

            buf = BytesIO()
            image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
            return image, buf
```

In the corrected code:
1. We use the `with` statement to open the image file using `Image.open`.
2. We check for the image mode directly, assuming that if the format is PNG and mode is not RGBA, then it is in RGB mode.
3. We continue with the image processing and return the modified image and buffer.
