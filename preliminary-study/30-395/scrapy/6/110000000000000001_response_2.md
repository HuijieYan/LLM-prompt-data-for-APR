Potential Error:
The potential error in the provided function is that when the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA', the function tries to convert the image to 'RGB' format before resizing it. This could lead to unexpected results as the image is being converted before resizing.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function is not handling the case where the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA' properly. It is converting the image to 'RGB' before resizing, which may not be the desired behavior.

Possible Approach:
To fix this bug, the function should first resize the image and then convert it to 'RGB' format if needed. Additionally, it should handle the case where the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA' separately.

Corrected Code:
```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```
