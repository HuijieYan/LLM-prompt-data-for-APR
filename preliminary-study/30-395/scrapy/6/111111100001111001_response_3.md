Potential issues:
The bug in the provided code is that if the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', the function tries to convert the image to RGB format by creating a new RGBA background and pasting the original image onto it, and then converting it to RGB. This logic is incorrect and needs to be fixed.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the logic to convert PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB format is incorrect. It instead creates a new RGBA background, pastes the original image onto it, and then converts the whole background to RGB, which is not the correct process to convert the original image itself.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
The correct approach to convert PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB format is to split the image into RGBA bands, paste the original image onto a new RGB background, and then convert it to RGB. This will preserve the transparency while converting the image to RGB mode.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageOps
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image.load()  # Ensure the image is loaded
        background = Image.new("RGB", image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, mask=image.split()[3])  # Paste the original image using the alpha channel as a mask
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = ImageOps.fit(image, size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, format='JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected code performs the correct conversion of PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB format while preserving the transparency. Additionally, it uses `ImageOps.fit` to ensure that the image is resized while maintaining its aspect ratio.
