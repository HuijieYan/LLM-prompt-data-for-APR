The problem in the buggy function `_dict_arg` is that it's not properly formatting the dictionary values before adding them to the command list. When a dictionary is encountered, it should be formatted as `"key=value"` and added to the `command` list. However, the buggy function is enclosing the value part in double quotes even when it's not needed. This is causing a mismatch with the expected command list in the test cases.

To fix this issue, the value part should only be enclosed in double quotes if it contains spaces or special characters. Otherwise, it should be added directly to the `command` list without quotes.

Below is the corrected code for function `_dict_arg`:

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job

    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn

    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # this is the corrected function
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                formatted_val = '"{}={}"'.format(prop, val) if ' ' in val else '{}={}'.format(prop, val)
                command += [name, formatted_val]
        return command
```

With this correction, the function `'_dict_arg'` will properly format the dictionary values based on whether they contain spaces or not, and the expected command lists in the test cases should now match the actual command lists generated by the function.
