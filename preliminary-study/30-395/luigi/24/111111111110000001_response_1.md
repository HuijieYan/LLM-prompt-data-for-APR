The error in the output suggests that the issue is related to how the `command` list is being constructed in the `_dict_arg` function. The error message mentions differences between lists, specifically with regards to handling values associated with keys in the input dictionary.

From the error messages, it seems that the issue is related to the treatment of quotation marks in the command list. The expected command should not contain quotes around key-value pairs.

To fix the issue, the code in the `_dict_arg` function needs to be modified such that it correctly constructs the command list without any unnecessary quotation marks.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In the corrected version, the string formatting is changed so the key-value pairs are added to the command list without extra quotation marks. This change addresses the issue raised in the error messages.
