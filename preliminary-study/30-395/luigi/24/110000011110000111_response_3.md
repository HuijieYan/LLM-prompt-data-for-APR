The error message indicates that the lists being compared are not equivalent. It specifically states that the values for the '--conf' argument are being treated differently. In the first error message, the value is '"Prop=Value"' and in the second error message, the value is '"prop1=val1"'. This indicates that the values are being treated as strings with double quotes in the first case and as plain strings in the second case.

The issue is with the _dict_arg function. It creates a list 'command' by appending name and formatted string of prop and value. The issue is with the formatting of the string, as it adds extra double quotes around the formatted key-value pair.

To fix the issue, the formatting of the key-value pair should not include double quotes around the value. This will ensure that the resulting list does not treat the value as a string with double quotes.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed extra double quotes
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will correctly format the key-value pairs without enclosing the value in double quotes, which should resolve the issue observed in the error messages.
