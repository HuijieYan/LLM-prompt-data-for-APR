The error is occurring in the `_dict_arg` function. The error message indicates that there is a difference in the elements of the list `proc.call_args[0][0]` and the expected list. Specifically, it mentions that there is a difference in the format of the `--conf` argument. 

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `_dict_arg` function is adding the `" "` (double quotes) around the key-value pairs in the format `"{0}={1}"`. This is causing the format to differ from the expected format.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes in the `"{0}={1}"` format and modify the function to append the command without quotes.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]
    return command
```
