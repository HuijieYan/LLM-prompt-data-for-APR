The error occurs because the _dict_arg function in the SparkSubmitTask class is not implemented correctly. It is intended to iterate through a dictionary and append its key-value pairs as arguments to the command list, but it does not handle the key and value formatting properly, resulting in discrepancies between the expected and actual call arguments.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the _dict_arg function to properly format the key-value pairs before adding them to the command list.

Here's the corrected code for the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Fixed formatting of key-value pairs
        return command
```

With this correction, the _dict_arg function should now correctly handle the key-value pairs in the input dictionary and format them as expected for the command list.
