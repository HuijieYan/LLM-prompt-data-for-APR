Potential error location: The error is likely occurring within the loop where the command variable is being updated.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The issue is that the code is improperly formatting the key-value pairs from the input dictionary as strings and appending them to the 'command' list. The current code appends the key and value inside double quotes, which is not necessary and causing the incorrect output.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Remove the unnecessary double quotes from the string formatting inside the loop.

Corrected code:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
