The bug is in the way the `command` list is being constructed within the `_dict_arg` function. It is appending the `name` and `"{0}={1}"` format string, and the concatenation is leading to unexpected results.

The bug occurs because the current code is not properly formatting the dictionary key-value pairs into strings for the `command` list.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the strings are concatenated within the for loop.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name + ' "{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val))
    return command
```

This code correctly formats the dictionary key-value pairs into strings and appends them to the `command` list, using single quotes around the `{0}={1}` format to ensure that the entire string is added as a single element in the `command` list.

With this change, the function should now correctly construct the `command` list with the expected values and types mentioned in the "Expected variable value and type" section above.
