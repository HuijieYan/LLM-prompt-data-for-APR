The issue with the `_dict_arg` method is that it adds unnecessary quotes around the property and value pairs when converting a dictionary to command arguments. This causes the test cases to fail, as the expected command output does not match the actual output due to these unnecessary quotes.

To fix this issue, the unnecessary quotes should be removed from around the property and value pairs when building the `command` list.

Corrected code for the `_dict_arg` method:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # removed unnecessary quotes
    return command
```
