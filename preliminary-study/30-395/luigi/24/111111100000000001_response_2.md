Potential error location: The potential error in the `_dict_arg` function is the reassignment of the `value` variable in the for loop, which overwrites the original value passed to the function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The original value passed to the function is being overwritten by the loop variable `value`, resulting in unexpected behavior and incorrect command generation.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Use a different variable name in the for loop to avoid overwriting the original value. Additionally, handle the case when the input value is not a dictionary.

Corrected code:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # Use a different variable name for the loop
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```
