The potential error in the `_dict_arg` function is in the line where the `command` list is being constructed. The issue is that the values inside the `dict` should be enclosed within double quotes for it to be interpreted correctly as key-value pairs in the Spark configuration. However, the current implementation is not accounting for this.

To fix this, we need to modify the way the key-value pairs are constructed inside the `command` list by enclosing the value with double quotes.

One approach to fix the bug is to modify the line:
```python
command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]
```
to:
```python
command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]
```

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]
    return command
```
