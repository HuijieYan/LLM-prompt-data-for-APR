The provided code is meant to modify input parameters into a list of commands, replacing some of them with a dict formatted string. However, in the buggy version, the string formatting adds double quotes around the dict key-value pairs. This causes the test cases to fail, as the expected result does not contain double quotes.

A potential fix for the bug is to remove the double quotes from the formatting of dict pairs in the command list.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
