The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the unnecessary use of double quotes around the property and its value. The function is mistakenly adding double quotes around the property and value pairs when assembling the command list, leading to a mismatch with the expected command list in the test cases.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes when constructing the command list.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Removed unnecessary double quotes
    return command
```

By altering the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]` to `command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, value)]`, we ensure that the property and value are formatted correctly without unnecessary quotes.

This correction should resolve the test failures and ensure that the function works as expected.
