Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. 

Reasons behind the bug: The bug occurs because the code is incorrectly formatting the key-value pairs from the input dictionary as a string within a list and appending it to the `command` list.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Instead of formatting the key-value pairs as a string within a list, we should format them as a single string and then append it to the `command` list.

Corrected code:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(f'{name}="{prop}={val}"')
    return command
```

In this corrected code, the key-value pairs are formatted as a single string with the format `"{name}="{prop}={val}""` and then appended to the `command` list. This will produce the expected output as specified in the test cases.
