The error message suggests that the lists being compared have differences in their elements, specifically how the 'conf' argument is formatted.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the generation of the 'command' list. The issue seems to be related to how the 'conf' argument is being processed and added to the 'command' list.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the 'conf' argument is being formatted as a string with double quotes, causing a mismatch with the expected format, leading to the assertion failures.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes from around the 'conf' argument value before adding it to the 'command' list.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            if prop == 'conf':
                command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, value)]  # Remove double quotes
            else:
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]
    return command
```
