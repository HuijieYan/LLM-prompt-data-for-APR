The error message indicates that there is an issue with the argument list being generated by the `_dict_arg` method in the `SparkSubmitTask` class. The issue seems to be related to how the arguments are formatted.

The error seems to be caused by the fact that when adding the key-value pairs to the `command` list, the value is being enclosed in double quotes even if the value is not a string.

A possible approach to fixing this issue is to check the type of the value and conditionally add double quotes. Also, we can separate each key-value pair with an equal sign without additional formatting.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` method:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            if isinstance(value, str):
                command.extend([name, f"{prop}={value}"])
            elif isinstance(value, int):
                command.extend([name, f"{prop}={value}"])
            elif isinstance(value, bool):
                command.extend([name, f"{prop}={str(value)}"])
    return command
```

In this corrected method, we use the `extend` method to add elements to the `command` list and we directly concatenate the key and value with an equal sign in between without additional formatting in the case of string, integer, and boolean values.
