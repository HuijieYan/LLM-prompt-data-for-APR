Potential Error Location: The error is likely occurring in the for loop that iterates through the key-value pairs in the dictionary.

Reasons for the Bug: The bug occurs because the loop variable `value` is being overwritten by the loop iteration variable `value`. As a result, only the last key-value pair in the dictionary is being processed, and the rest are being ignored.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable name for the loop iteration, so that it doesn't overwrite the original `value` variable. We can also simplify the logic of building the command list.

Corrected code:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # Use a different variable name for iteration
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, prop_value)]  # No need for double quotes here
    return command
```
