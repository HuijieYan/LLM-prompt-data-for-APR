The problem with the `_dict_arg` function is that it is incorrectly constructing the command list when the input value is a dictionary. It should be constructing the command list with the format "prop=value", but it is not formatting it correctly.

To fix this issue, the function needs to construct the command list using the correct format for each key-value pair in the input dictionary. The correct format should be "prop=value" without the quotes around the key-value pair.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected code, the function will correctly construct the command list with the format "prop=value" for each key-value pair in the input dictionary.
