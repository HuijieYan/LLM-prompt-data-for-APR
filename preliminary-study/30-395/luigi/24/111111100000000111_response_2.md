Potential error location:
The potential error is in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`, where the code is trying to append the `name` and a formatted string to the `command` list.

Reason for the bug:
The bug occurs because the code is using the variable name `value` in two different contexts - first as the input parameter to the function and then as the iteration variable in the for loop. This results in the overwriting of the `value` parameter and incorrect behavior of the function.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we should use a different variable name for the iteration variable in the for loop, so it does not conflict with the `value` parameter passed to the function.

Corrected code:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Use a different variable name 'val' for iteration
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Use 'val' instead of 'value'
    return command
```
