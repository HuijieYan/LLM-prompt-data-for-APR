Potential Error: The bug in the function is likely to be in the line where the `command` list is being constructed. The string concatenation may not be done correctly.

Reason for Bug: The bug occurs because the string concatenation in the `command` list is not done correctly when iterating through the dictionary items.

Approach for Fixing the Bug: To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the string concatenation in the `command` list is done correctly for each item in the dictionary.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append('{0}="{1}"'.format(prop, val))
    return [name] + command
```
