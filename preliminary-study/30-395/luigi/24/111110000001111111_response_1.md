The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it is adding double quotes around the property-value pair. This is not necessary and is causing the function to return the wrong value.

To fix this issue, we need to remove the double quotes from around the property-value pair in the `command` list.

Here is the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
