The bug in the `_dict_arg` method is related to the way the input dictionary's key-value pairs are being processed. The current implementation is not handling the dictionary input as expected, and the value for each key is being enclosed in double quotes, which leads to discrepancies in the test cases.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `_dict_arg` method to properly handle dictionary input and construct the command list accordingly.

Here is the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` method:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In the corrected method, the key-value pairs from the input dictionary are directly concatenated with the name and equals sign, without enclosing the value in double quotes. This will ensure that the command list is constructed correctly as per the input dictionary.
