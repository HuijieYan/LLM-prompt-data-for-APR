The bug in the provided function is that it is incorrectly formatting the dictionary items into the command list. It is adding unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs. Also, the loop variable `value` is being overwritten by both the input parameter and the loop variable, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we should remove the unnecessary double quotes and use a different variable name for the loop variable to avoid overwriting the input parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    
    return command
```

With this fix, the function will correctly format the dictionary items into the command list without adding unnecessary double quotes.
