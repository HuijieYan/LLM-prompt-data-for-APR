The bug seems to be in the `_dict_arg` method that doesn't construct the command properly.

The problem occurs because the `value` is set as a string, while it should be a raw value without quotes.

To fix the bug, we should remove the quotes when constructing the command.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` method:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
