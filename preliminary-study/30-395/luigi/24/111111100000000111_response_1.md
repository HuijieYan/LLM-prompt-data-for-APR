Potential error location: The potential error is in the for loop inside the _dict_arg function, where the variable name "value" is being used both as the loop iterator and as the input parameter, causing confusion and potentially incorrect behavior.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The variable name "value" is being used for both the input parameter and the loop iterator, which can lead to unexpected behavior and errors.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Change the variable name "value" used as the loop iterator to a different name to avoid confusion with the input parameter.
2. Use a more descriptive name for the loop iterator to improve code readability.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change the loop iterator name to 'val'
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Use 'val' as the loop iterator
    return command
```
