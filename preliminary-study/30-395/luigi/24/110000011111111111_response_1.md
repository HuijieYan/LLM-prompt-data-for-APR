The problem in the given function `_dict_arg` is that it incorrectly includes quotes around the values when it generates the `command` list. The code adds a `name` followed by a formatted string containing the key-value pair of the dictionary. It includes unnecessary double quotes around the formatted string.  

This results in a mismatch of expected and actual outputs in the test functions because the generated list includes extra quotes which shouldn't be there.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the function unnecessarily adds double quotes around the formatted string containing the key-value pair.

To fix the bug, the unnecessary double quotes should be removed from the formatted string when it is appended to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In this corrected code, the unnecessary double quotes around the formatted string `{0}={1}` have been removed. This ensures that the generated `command` list contains the correct key-value pairs without any extra characters.
