The bug in the given function is that it is adding extra double quotes around the key-value pairs when forming the `command` list.

The reason behind the bug is that the function is adding double quotes around the key-value pairs in the command list, which is not required.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs when forming the `command` list.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
