Potential error location: The potential error in the _dict_arg function is that it is using the same variable name "value" for the input parameter and the iteration variable within the for loop. This can cause unexpected behavior and incorrect results.

Reason behind the bug: The bug occurs because the same variable name "value" is being used for two different purposes - as the input parameter and as the iteration variable in the for loop. This leads to confusion and incorrect behavior.

Approach for fixing the bug: Change the variable name used in the for loop to something different from the input parameter name "value" to avoid confusion and ensure correct behavior.

Corrected code:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change the variable name from "value" to "val"
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Use the new variable name "val" in the format string
    return command
```
