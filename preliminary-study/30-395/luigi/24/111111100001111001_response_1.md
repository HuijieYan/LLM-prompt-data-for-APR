The issue with the current _dict_arg function is that the value is being enclosed in double quotes, even if it is a dictionary. This is causing the unexpected behavior in the returned list command.

The function should not enclose the dictionary values in quotes when creating the command list.

To fix this issue, we need to remove the double quotes around the formatted string `"prop=value"` and simply concatenate `name`, `prop`, and `value` directly in the command list.

Below is the corrected code for the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected function, the input dictionaries will be formatted correctly without the unnecessary double quotes, producing the expected output for the given test cases.
