Potential error location: The loop that concatenates the `name` and `"prop=value"` strings onto the `command` list.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The loop does not correctly concatenate `name` with the key-value pairs from the dictionary. The code has the same variable name `value` for both the input value and the loop variable, which can cause confusion and lead to unexpected behavior.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Change the loop variable name from `value` to something else, to avoid confusion with the input value.
2. Use string formatting to concatenate the `name` and `"prop=value"` strings together, instead of manually adding quotes and equal signs.

Corrected code:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(f'{name}="{prop}={val}"')
    return command
```
