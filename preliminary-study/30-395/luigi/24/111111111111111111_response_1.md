The bug in the function `_dict_arg` is caused by double quoting the `prop=value` pairs within the list `command`. This leads to the addition of extra quotes in the resulting command list. The `value` should not be enclosed in double quotes in order to form the correct command list.

To fix this bug, remove the double quotes around the `prop=value` pairs when appending them to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the double quotes around `prop=value`, the resulting `command` list will be directly formed with the key-value pairs, leading to the expected behavior as per the test cases.
