The bug in the provided function `_dict_arg` is caused by the unnecessary addition of extra double quotes around key-value pairs in the `command` list. This results in the discrepancy between the expected arguments and the actual arguments.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to remove the extra double quotes and directly append the key-value pairs to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the extra double quotes will be eliminated, and the command list will accurately represent the key-value pairs, resolving the bug and aligning the function output with the expected values.
