The error appears to be related to the implementation of the `_dict_arg` method inside the `SparkSubmitTask` class. The error message indicates that there is an issue with how the dictionary values are being added to the command list. The values are not being added in the correct format, causing differences between the expected and actual lists.

Upon analyzing the code, it seems that the bug is occurring because the `_dict_arg` method is adding dictionary key-value pairs to the `command` list in the incorrect format. Instead of adding them as strings in the format `prop=value`, it is added as `"prop=value"` (with double quotes).

To fix the bug, the `_dict_arg` method should not enclose the property and value in double quotes. Instead, it should add them directly as `prop=value`.

Here's the corrected implementation of the `_dict_arg` method:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, f"{prop}={val}"]
    return command
``` 

In the corrected code, the `f"{prop}={val}"` ensures that the property and value are concatenated without being enclosed in double quotes, which should address the bug.
