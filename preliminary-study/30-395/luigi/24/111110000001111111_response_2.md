The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not formatting the dictionary key-value pairs correctly when building the command list. It is not enclosing the key-value pairs within double quotes. This results in incorrect formatting of the command list.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the function to properly enclose the key-value pairs within double quotes.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}="{1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected function, the key-value pairs will be enclosed within double quotes, as expected.
