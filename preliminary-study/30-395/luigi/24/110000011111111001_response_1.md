The bug in the provided function is that it is adding double quotes around the property and value when creating the command list. This results in a mismatch between the expected and actual output when comparing the lists in the test functions. The mismatch is due to the presence of double quotes in the command list in the actual output.

To fix this bug, the function needs to construct the command list without adding double quotes around the property and value.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Remove double quotes
    return command
```

This corrected code constructs the command list without adding unnecessary double quotes, which should resolve the error encountered in the test functions.
