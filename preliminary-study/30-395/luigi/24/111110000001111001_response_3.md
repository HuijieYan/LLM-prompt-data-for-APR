The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not correctly formatting the elements of the dictionary into a string for the command list. The current implementation wraps the property and value inside double quotes, which is incorrect.

The bug occurs because the function is incorrectly formatting the dictionary values. It is using double quotes to enclose the property-value pairs, which results in the elements being interpreted as separate strings when they should all be a single string.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes and use the format `prop=value` for each property-value pair in the command list.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
