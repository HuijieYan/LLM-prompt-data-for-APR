Potential error location: The potential error is in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. Here, the value is being enclosed in double quotes, which might cause issues when the command is being used.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The value should not be enclosed in double quotes as part of the command. This might result in syntax errors or unexpected behavior when using the command.

Approach for fixing the bug: Rather than enclosing the value in double quotes within the command, it should be added without quotes. This will ensure that the command is constructed correctly.

Corrected code:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # changed variable name to val to avoid conflict
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # removed quotes around {1}
    return command
```
