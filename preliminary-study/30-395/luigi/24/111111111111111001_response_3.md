The bug occurs because the `_dict_arg` method is incorrectly adding quotes around the property and value when constructing the command. This is causing the test cases to fail as they expect the format `prop=value` rather than `"prop=value"`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` method to construct the command without adding extra quotes around the property and value.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` method:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, val)]  # Modified this line to construct the command without quotes
    return command
```

With this change, the test cases should pass as the command will be constructed in the expected format (`prop=value`).

This modification ensures that the command generated by the `_dict_arg` method matches the expected format and resolves the bug that caused the test cases to fail.
