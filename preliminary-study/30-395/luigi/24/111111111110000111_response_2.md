The issue seems to be with how the `_dict_arg` function is handling the "value" parameter, which represents a dictionary. The current implementation is adding double quotes around the value of each dictionary key-value pair, resulting in the assertion errors observed in the test cases.

The cause of the bug is that the current implementation incorrectly adds double quotes around the values of the dictionary key-value pairs. This causes a mismatch between the expected and actual values checked in the test cases.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `_dict_arg` function to handle the dictionary key-value pairs without adding double quotes around the values.

Here's the corrected `dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name to avoid shadowing 'value'
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Removed double quotes around the value
    return command
```
