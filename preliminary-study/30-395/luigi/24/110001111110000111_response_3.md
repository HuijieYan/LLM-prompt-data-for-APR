## Issue
The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it uses the same name `value` for the loop variable and the input argument, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Explanation
The error occurs because the code appends a formatted string for the property and value pair to the `command` list. However, the original value of `value` is lost because the loop variable also uses the name `value`. This causes the inequality in the test cases.

## Possible approaches
To fix this issue, the loop variable should have a different name from the input argument. This will prevent overwriting the value and ensure that the correct value is used to build the `command` list.

Additionally, the code should check if the input dictionary is empty before performing any operations to avoid unnecessary iterations.

## Updated Code
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, input_dict):
    command = []
    if input_dict and isinstance(input_dict, dict):
        for prop, val in input_dict.items():  # Change the loop variable name to 'val'
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
