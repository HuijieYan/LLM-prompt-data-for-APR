The error message indicates that the test is failing due to a discrepancy in the contents of the list. It seems that the issue is related to the conversion of the dictionary argument to the desired command format. 

The bug seems to be located in the `_dict_arg` method. The issue is likely due to the incorrect formatting of the command when constructing it from the dictionary argument.

The reason behind the bug is that the method is adding unnecessary quotes around the values when constructing the command, which is causing discrepancies when comparing the list of arguments. 

One possible approach to fix the bug is to remove the unnecessary quotes and adjust the formatting of the command construction.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` method:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In this corrected version, unnecessary quotes around the values are removed to ensure that the constructed command matches the expected format, resolving the discrepancy found in the error messages.
