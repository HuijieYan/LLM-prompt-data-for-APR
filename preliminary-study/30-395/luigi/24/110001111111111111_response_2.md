The issue with the buggy function `_dict_arg` is that it adds extra quotes around the property-value pair when creating the command list, causing the assertion error in the test cases. This is evident from the test case's expected value and type given in the 'Expected variable value and type before function return' section.

The reason behind the bug is that unnecessary double quotes are added around the property-value pair when creating the command list, which leads to a mismatch with the expected values in the test cases.

To fix the bug, the unnecessary double quotes should be removed from around the property-value pair added to the command list.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In the corrected code, the unnecessary double quotes around the property-value pair have been removed from the command list. This modification should resolve the issue and align the function's behavior with the expected values in the test cases.
