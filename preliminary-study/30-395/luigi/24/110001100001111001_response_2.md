The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it does not properly format the dictionary key-value pairs into a list of strings for the `command` variable. The function should be updated to correctly format the key-value pairs and append them to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed the variable name from 'value' to 'val' to avoid conflict
            command.append(name + '="' + prop + '=' + str(val) + '"')  # Correctly format the key-value pair and append it to the command list
    return command
```

The changes made include:
1. Renaming the variable `value` within the loop to `val` to avoid conflict with the parameter `value` of the function.
2. Using the correct format for appending key-value pairs to the `command` list.

These changes ensure that the key-value pairs from the input dictionary are correctly formatted and appended to the `command` list, addressing the issues in the original implementation.
