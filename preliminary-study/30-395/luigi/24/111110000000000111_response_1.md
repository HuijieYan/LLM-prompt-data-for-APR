Potential error location:
The potential error in the function lies in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. It seems that the intention is to add elements to the `command` list, but using the `+=` operator in this way is incorrect.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the `+=` operator is used to concatenate lists, but it's being used with a list and a string. This results in unexpected behavior and incorrect concatenation of the elements.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
The correct approach would be to use the `append` method to add elements to the `command` list, rather than using the `+=` operator. This will ensure that the elements are added individually rather than concatenating a list with a string.

Corrected code:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append('"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val))
    return command
```
