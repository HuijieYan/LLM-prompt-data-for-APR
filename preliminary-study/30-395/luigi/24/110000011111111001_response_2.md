The issue in the provided function is that it's adding quotation marks around the property and its value as part of the command, which is causing the test cases to fail.

Error in test case 1: It's expecting the value 'Prop=Value' with double quotes, but the function is returning it without the quotes.

Error in test case 2: The function is adding the value 'prop1=val1' with double quotes but the test case is expecting it without quotes.

The reason for this bug is that the function is formatting the property and value with double quotes and creating a list while the test cases are expecting different formats of the property and value.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes from around '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value) in the function.

Here is the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
