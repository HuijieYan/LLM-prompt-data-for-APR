The error in the function `_dict_arg` is that when generating the `command` list, the keys and values from the dictionary `value` are enclosed in double quotes and concatenated. This is causing issues with comparison in the test cases.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code adds double quotes around the values in the command list which is not necessary.

To fix the bug, simply remove the double quotes from the values when appending them to the `command` list. Also, it's better to rename the variable `value` in the for loop to avoid shadowing the function's argument `value`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will correctly generate the `command` list without unnecessary double quotes around the values, resolving the issue observed in the test cases.
