Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the string formatting when creating the command list.

Reason for the bug: The buggy function is not properly formatting the dictionary items into strings to be added to the command list.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use string formatting to properly create the formatted key-value pairs for the command list.
2. Ensure that the values are enclosed in double quotes, as it is expected in the tests.

Corrected code:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
