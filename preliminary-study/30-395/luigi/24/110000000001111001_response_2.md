Potential error location: The bug is likely in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. The code is incorrectly adding the name and value as separate elements inside the command list, and it is also adding double quotes around the key-value pairs.

Reason for the bug: The bug occurs because the code should be adding the key-value pairs as one string without double quotes, and the name should be added separately as a prefix.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: We can fix the bug by modifying the line to correctly format and add the key-value pairs to the command list.

Corrected code:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name from value to val to avoid conflict
            command.append(f"{name}={prop}={val}")  # Modified the line to correctly format and add the key-value pairs
    return command
```
