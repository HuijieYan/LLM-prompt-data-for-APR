The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not properly creating the command list. It is directly adding the key-value pairs to the list, but it should add them as strings in the format `"key=value"`.

The reason for the bug is that the previous implementation did not format the key-value pairs properly when adding them to the command list.

To fix the bug, we need to format the key-value pairs as strings and then add them to the command list.

Here is the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append('"{}={}"'.format(prop, val))
    return command
```
