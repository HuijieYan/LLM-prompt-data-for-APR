Potential error location: The bug is likely occurring in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]` within the `_dict_arg` function.

Reason for the bug: The bug occurs because the current code incorrectly adds the name and formatted string to the `command` list. It should append the formatted string directly, without enclosing it in a list.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, we need to directly append the formatted string instead of creating a list and then appending it to the `command` list.

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append('{0}="{1}={2}"'.format(name, prop, val))
    return command
```
