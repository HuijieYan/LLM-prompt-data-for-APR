The issue in the provided function is that it doesn't handle the dictionary type input properly. Instead of processing the dictionary elements as separate key-value pairs, it processes the entire dictionary as a single value. This can be observed in the error messages where the expected and actual outputs differ due to the incorrect processing of the dictionary input.

To fix this issue, the function needs to properly iterate over the dictionary elements and format them as key-value pairs before adding them to the command list.

The incorrect processing of the dictionary input in the buggy function is causing the error. Instead of processing the dictionary elements as separate key-value pairs, it processes the entire dictionary as a single value, leading to the formatting issues in the command list.

To fix this issue, the function should properly iterate over the dictionary elements and format them as key-value pairs before adding them to the command list.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Format key-value pairs correctly
        return command
```

With this correction, the function will correctly iterate over the dictionary elements, format them as key-value pairs, and add them to the command list, resolving the formatting issues observed in the test cases.
