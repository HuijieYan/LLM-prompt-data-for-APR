The error in the provided function `_dict_arg` is caused by the way dictionary values are being formatted into the command list. The error message indicates that the expected command list includes dictionary values in quotation marks that are not present in the actual command list.

This occurs because the function is currently wrapping the dictionary values in quotation marks, resulting in additional quotation marks in the command list, which is causing the test case to fail.

To fix this issue, the `value` from the dictionary should not be wrapped in quotation marks when constructing the command list. Instead, the dictionary values should be directly appended to the command list without additional formatting.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
