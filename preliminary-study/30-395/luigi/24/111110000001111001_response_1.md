The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not correctly formatting the dictionary key-value pair when adding it to the `command` list. The current implementation adds the key-value pair as separate elements in the list, but it should be added as a single string with the format "key=value".

The reason for the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the formatting of the dictionary values when adding them to the command list.

To fix the bug, the function should iterate through the dictionary and format each key-value pair as "key=value" before adding it to the command list.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

With this correction, the function will properly format the key-value pairs and add them to the `command` list, resulting in the expected behavior described in the test cases.
