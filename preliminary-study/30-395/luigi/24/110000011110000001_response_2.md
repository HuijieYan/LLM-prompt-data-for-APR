The problem with the _dict_arg function is that it constructs the "command" list by appending the values to the list, but it also wraps the property-value pairs in double quotes. This double quoting of the values results in assertion errors because the assertions in the test functions do not have double quotes around the property values.

The reason for the bug is that the function is incorrectly adding double quotes around the property values, which causes the test assertions to fail when comparing the constructed command with the expected command.

To fix this bug, the function needs to be modified to construct the "command" list without adding double quotes around the property values.

Here is the corrected code for the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # changed variable name to 'val' to avoid conflict
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # removed double quotes
    return command
```
In the corrected code, the double quotes around the property values are removed, and the variable name 'value' is changed to 'val' in the loop to avoid conflict with the function argument name.
