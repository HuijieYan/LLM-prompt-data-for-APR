The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is wrapping the property and value in double quotes when adding to the `command` list, resulting in incorrect formatting.

The reason for the bug is that the function is adding the property and value inside double quotes, which causes the test cases to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes from the property and value when adding them to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # changed value to val to avoid conflict
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # removed double quotes
    return command
```

With this corrected function, the test cases should pass without any assertion errors.
