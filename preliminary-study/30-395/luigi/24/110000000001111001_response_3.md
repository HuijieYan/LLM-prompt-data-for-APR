Potential error location: The error may be occurring when the values are being concatenated to the `command` list.

Reason for the bug: The bug occurs because the values are being added as separate elements to the `command` list, instead of being enclosed within quotes.

Approach for fixing the bug: Modify the code to enclose the `prop=value` pairs within quotes before adding them to the `command` list.

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append('{0}="{1}={2}"'.format(name, prop, val))
    return command
```
