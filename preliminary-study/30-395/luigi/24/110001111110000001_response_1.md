The error message from the test function indicates that there is a mismatch in the expected and actual values of the list being compared. The error is related to the use of quotation marks in the list elements. It looks like the function `_dict_arg` is adding quotation marks around the property and value, which is causing the assertion errors in the test cases.

The potential error location within the `_dict_arg` function is the line where the elements are added to the `command` list: `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. Here, the quotation marks are being added unnecessarily.

The bug occurs because when the function adds quotation marks around the property and value, it creates a mismatch when compared to the expected values in the test cases.

One approach to fixing the bug is to remove the quotation marks from the elements being added to the command list in the `_dict_arg` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name from value to val to avoid conflict
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed quotation marks
    return command
```

By removing the quotation marks from the elements being added to the `command` list, the function will now generate the expected list of arguments, resolving the assertion errors in the test cases.
