The error occurs when the function `_dict_arg` tries to create a command list based on the input dictionary. The issue arises due to the unnecessary double quotations surrounding the values in the command list, causing an AssertionError in the test cases.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to correctly handle the dictionary input by removing the unwanted double quotations around the values.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

By modifying the function to use the `format` method directly without the unnecessary double quotations, we can ensure that the resulting command list aligns with the expected format and resolve the AssertionError in the test cases.
