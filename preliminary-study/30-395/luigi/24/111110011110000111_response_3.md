The issue in the provided code is that the `_dict_arg` function is not correctly handling the dictionary values when building the command list. The function is converting the dictionary values into strings and adding extra double quotation marks to them, causing mismatches between expected and actual command lists.

Reasons behind the bug:
1. The function is incorrectly converting dictionary values to strings with additional double quotation marks.
2. This extra formatting is causing differences in the expected and actual command lists, leading to assertion errors.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Remove the extra double quotation marks around the dictionary values when constructing the command list.
2. Modify the function to handle dictionary values appropriately, without converting them to strings.

The corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

In the corrected code, the `'{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)` construct resolves the issue of unnecessary double quotation marks around dictionary values. This approach ensures that the command list is constructed correctly without any extra formatting, fixing the bug in the original function.
