The error message indicates that there is a "TypeError" occurring on line 245 of the scheduler.py file. The error is specifically happening when trying to perform addition between a 'NoneType' and an 'int'.

Upon analyzing the provided code, it can be seen that the issue lies with the initialization of the 'last_active' attribute in the __init__ method of the Worker class. When 'last_active' is not provided, its default value is set to 'None'. This causes a problem when trying to perform arithmetic operations on it.

To fix this issue, we should ensure that 'last_active' is initialized to a valid numeric value if it is not provided during the creation of a Worker instance.

Here's the corrected code for the __init__ method of the Worker class:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

In this corrected code, we use a conditional expression to check if 'last_active' is not None. If it is not None, we use its value. If it is None, we initialize it to the current time using time.time().

With this correction, the arithmetic operation that caused the TypeError should work properly.
