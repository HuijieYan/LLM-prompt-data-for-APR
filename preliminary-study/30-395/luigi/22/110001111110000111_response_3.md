1. The test case tries to create a Worker object and then calls the prune method on it, passing a temporary configuration object as an argument. The error message indicates that there is a TypeError when trying to add the last_active attribute of the Worker object to the worker_disconnect_delay attribute of the configuration object.

2. The potential error location is within the prune method of the Worker class, specifically at the line where the last_active attribute is being used in comparison with the worker_disconnect_delay attribute.

3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the last_active attribute is being initialized as None, and when the prune method tries to add the worker_disconnect_delay value to it, a TypeError is raised because you cannot add an integer (worker_disconnect_delay) to None.

4. To fix the bug, the last_active attribute should be initialized with the current time if it's not provided as an argument when creating the Worker object. This will ensure that last_active is always a valid integer value.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform pruning operation here
            pass
```

By initializing the last_active attribute with the current time if it's not provided, we ensure that it always holds a valid integer value, preventing the TypeError encountered in the test case.
