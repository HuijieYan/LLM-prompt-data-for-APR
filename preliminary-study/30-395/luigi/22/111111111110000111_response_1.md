The error message indicates that the bug is occurring in the `prune()` method of the `Worker` class. Specifically, the error is due to the `self.last_active` variable being of type `None` and the program trying to add the `worker_disconnect_delay` to it.

The reason for the bug is that the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class has a default value of `None`. This means that if the `last_active` is not provided when an instance of `Worker` is created, its value remains `None`.

To fix the bug, the `__init__` method needs to be modified to handle the case when `last_active` is not provided. One approach could be to set the `last_active` to the current time if no value is provided.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch if last_active is not provided
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this modification, if `last_active` is not provided when creating a `Worker` instance, it will default to the current time, ensuring that it always has a valid value.

This should resolve the TypeError that occurred during the `prune()` method call.
