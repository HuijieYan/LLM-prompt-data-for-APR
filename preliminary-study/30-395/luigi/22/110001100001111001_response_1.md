The potential error in the `__init__` method is that `time` module is not imported, but used in the method. This will result in a `NameError` when trying to run this method.

To fix the bug, we need to import the `time` module at the beginning of the file. Also, it's not clear what `self.reference` is supposed to be initialized as, so we will leave that as is.

Here's the corrected code:
```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
With this correction, the code will run without any errors and initialize the `Worker` object with the specified attributes.
