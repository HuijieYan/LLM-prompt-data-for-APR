The __init__ function initializes the Worker object with the provided worker_id and last_active time, if available. However, there are a couple of issues in the provided code:
1. The 'time' module is not imported, so the time.time() call will result in an error.
2. The self.reference attribute is initialized to None but is not explicitly used or required anywhere in the function.

To fix the code, we can remove the unnecessary self.reference initialization and import the time module to use the time.time() function for initializing self.started.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import time

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/luigi_22/luigi/scheduler.py
class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this corrected code, the unnecessary self.reference attribute has been removed, and the time module is imported to use the time.time() function for initialization. The function signature now aligns with the expected input and output values, as described in the test case.
