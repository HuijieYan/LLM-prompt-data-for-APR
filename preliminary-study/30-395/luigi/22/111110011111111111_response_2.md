The error occurs in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class, particularly at the line `if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():` where it tries to perform addition between `self.last_active` and an integer value, but `self.last_active` is `None` which causes the `TypeError`.

The bug occurs because the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class has a default value of `None`, but it is being used in the `prune` method without being properly initialized.

To fix this bug, the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method should be initialized with a default value of the current time in seconds since epoch if it is not provided.

Here's the corrected code for the `Worker` class:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # perform pruning operations
            pass
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will default to the current time if no value is provided, ensuring that it is always initialized when the `prune` method is called.
