Potential error location: 
The bug is likely occurring in the initialization of the `Worker` class, specifically in the `__init__` method.

Reasons behind the bug:
The bug occurs because the `last_active` parameter is initialized with a default value of `None`, but its type is expected to be a float (seconds since epoch). Additionally, the `time` module has not been imported, so the `time.time()` function will raise an error.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Import the `time` module at the beginning of the file.
2. Initialize `last_active` with the current time if no value is provided.
3. Ensure that the `worker_id` input is of type `int`.

Corrected code:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = time.time() if last_active is None else last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
