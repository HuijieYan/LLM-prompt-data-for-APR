The error message indicates a TypeError occurring in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class. The error is specifically happening at the line `if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():`. This suggests that the `last_active` attribute of the `Worker` class is not being initialized properly.

Looking at the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class, we see that the `last_active` attribute is being set to `last_active` if it's provided, otherwise it defaults to `None`. This indicates that the issue might be related to `last_active` not being set properly when the `Worker` class is initialized.

The reason behind this bug is that the `last_active` attribute is not being set to the expected value of `1702321538.4872892` during the initialization of the `Worker` class.

To fix this issue, we should ensure that the `last_active` attribute is correctly set during the initialization of the `Worker` class.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By making this modification, the `last_active` attribute will be set to the provided value if it's not `None`, otherwise it will default to the current time using `time.time()`. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the `last_active` attribute is properly initialized.
