The error occurs because the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method of the Worker class is set to None by default and is not handled properly in the `prune` method. This causes a TypeError when trying to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to `self.last_active` in the `prune` method.

To fix this, we can modify the `__init__` method to handle the case when `last_active` is None. We can set a default value for `last_active` if it is not provided in the constructor. This can be done using the `if` statement to check if `last_active` is None, and if it is, then setting it to the current time using `time.time()`.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
# corrected __init__ method
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this modification, the `last_active` attribute will default to the current time if it is not provided, which will prevent the TypeError when calling the `prune` method.

By incorporating the corrected `__init__` method, the issue causing the TypeError in the test function will be resolved.
