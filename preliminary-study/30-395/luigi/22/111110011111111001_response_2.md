The error occurs when the `prune` method is called on the `Worker` object. The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError` because the addition operation is being performed on a `NoneType` and an `int` (specifically, `self.last_active` is `None`).

The issue is that the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class is given a default value of `None`. This causes problems when the `prune` method tries to use this value in an addition operation.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that `last_active` is initialized with a valid timestamp inside the `__init__` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By checking if `last_active` is `None` and initializing it with `time.time()` if it is, we ensure that `last_active` always contains a valid timestamp.

With this correction, the `prune` method should no longer encounter the `TypeError` when performing the addition operation.
