The error occurs in the `prune(self, config)` method of the `Worker` class in the `scheduler.py` file. The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError` because the `self.last_active` attribute is of type `NoneType`, and it is attempting to add it to an `int` value.

This error occurs because the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class is set to `None` by default, and it is not being handled properly in the `prune` method. 

To fix this issue, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` in the `prune` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `Worker` class:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # corrected __init__ method
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    # corrected prune method
    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # prune the worker
            pass
```

With this modification, the `prune` method will handle the case where `last_active` is `None` by defaulting it to the current time using `time.time()`. This will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.
