1. The test case is trying to create an instance of the `Worker` class and then calling the `prune` method on that instance. The error message indicates that the issue is with the `prune` method and specifically with the line `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time()`.

2. The potential error location is within the `prune` method of the `Worker` class.

3. The error occurs because the `last_active` attribute of the `Worker` instance is initialized with a default value of `None` in the `__init__` method. When the `prune` method is called, it tries to add `None` to an integer value, resulting in a `TypeError`.

4. To fix the bug, the `last_active` attribute should be initialized with a default value of `time.time()` in the `__init__` method. This will ensure that `last_active` always holds a valid timestamp when the `Worker` instance is created.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` attribute will be initialized with the current timestamp if no value is provided when creating a new `Worker` instance. This will prevent `None` from being used in arithmetic operations, fixing the `TypeError` issue.
