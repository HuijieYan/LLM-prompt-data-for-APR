The potential error in the code is that the `time` module has not been imported, so the `time.time()` function call will cause an error.

To fix this, the `time` module needs to be imported at the beginning of the file.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import time  # import the time module

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
With the time module imported, the `time.time()` function will now work properly within the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class.
