```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
```
Corrected function of the provided buggy function. I have also defined the Worker class for the function to be complete and give the intended output.
