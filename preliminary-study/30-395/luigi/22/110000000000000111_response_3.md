Potential error location: The error might occur due to the use of `time.time()` without importing the `time` module in the code.

Reasons behind the bug: The code is trying to use the `time.time()` function without importing the `time` module, so it results in an AttributeError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Import the `time` module at the beginning of the code to use the `time.time()` function.

Corrected code:
```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
