The potential error location within the problematic function is the initialization of the `last_active` and `started` variables. The bug occurs because the `last_active` variable is being assigned a float value, while the `started` variable is being assigned the result of `time.time()` without calling the `time` module.

To fix this bug, we need to import the `time` module and call the `time.time()` function to initialize the `started` variable. Additionally, we need to address the issue of the `last_active` variable not being set to a default value in case `last_active` is not provided.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this corrected code, the `last_active` variable will be initialized to the current time if no value is provided, and the `started` variable will be set to the current time using the `time` module.
