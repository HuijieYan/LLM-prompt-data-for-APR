Potential Error Location:
The error seems to be occurring in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class in the `luigi.scheduler` module. Specifically, the error is in the line `if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():`.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug is occurring because the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class is set to `None` by default, which is causing an issue when trying to add it to an integer in the `prune` method.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Change the default value of `last_active` to the current time in the `__init__` method.
2. Modify the `prune` method to handle the case where `last_active` is `None`.
3. Handle the `None` case in the comparison in the `prune` method.

Corrected Code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/luigi_22/luigi/scheduler.py

# corrected function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}

# test function remains the same
```
