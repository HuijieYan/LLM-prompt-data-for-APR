The error message indicates that there is a TypeError due to unsupported operand types. This occurs when trying to add `self.last_active` (which is currently set to None) with the `config.worker_disconnect_delay`.

The potential error location within the `__init__` function of the Worker class is the initialization of `last_active` with a default value of `None`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that when the `prune` method is called, it tries to add `self.last_active` (which is `None`) with an integer value, resulting in a TypeError.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `__init__` function to set the `last_active` attribute to the current time if no value is provided. This will ensure that `last_active` is always an integer value and prevent the TypeError when calling the `prune` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` function of the Worker class:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else int(time.time())  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this modification, the `__init__` function sets the `last_active` attribute to the current time if no value is provided, ensuring that `last_active` is always an integer value. This will prevent the TypeError when calling the `prune` method.
