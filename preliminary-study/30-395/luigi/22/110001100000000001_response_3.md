The potential error in the provided function is that it seems to be intended for a class, as indicated by the use of `self`, but it is not defined within a class. This is evident from the use of `self.id = worker_id` instead of `self.id = worker_id` within a class definition.

To fix this, the function needs to be placed within a class and the `self` parameter needs to be added to the function signature.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/luigi_22/luigi/scheduler.py

import time

class Scheduler:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
