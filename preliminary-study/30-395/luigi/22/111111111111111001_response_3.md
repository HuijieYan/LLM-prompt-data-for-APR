The error is occurring within the `prune` method of the `Worker` class. The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError` when attempting to perform addition with a `NoneType` and an integer.

The potential error location within the `__init__` method is the `last_active` parameter. Since it has a default value of `None`, if it is not provided during the initialization of the `Worker` object, `self.last_active` will be set to `None`. Later, in the `prune` method, this `None` value is causing the `TypeError` when attempting to add it to an integer.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to check if the `last_active` parameter is `None` and handle the case accordingly. One approach is to set `self.last_active` to the current time if no value is provided during initialization.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, if `last_active` is not provided during the initialization of a `Worker` object, it will default to the current time. This should resolve the `TypeError` that was occurring in the `prune` method.
