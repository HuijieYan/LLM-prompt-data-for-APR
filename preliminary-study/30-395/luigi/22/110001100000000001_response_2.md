Potential error location: The error is likely in the assignment of the instance variables in the __init__ method. 

Reason for the bug: The error is caused by using instance variables without initializing them properly.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, we need to import the time module and properly initialize the instance variables in the __init__ method.

Corrected code:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
