Potential Error location: The problematic function seems to be a constructor for a class, but it is not written as a class method.

Reason for the bug: The function is intended to be a constructor for a class, but it is not written in the correct format to be a class method. As a result, it will not correctly initialize the instance variables.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Rewrite the function as a class method by including the class parameter "self" as the first parameter. This will allow the function to correctly initialize the instance variables when an object of the class is created.

Corrected code:
```python
class Scheduler:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
