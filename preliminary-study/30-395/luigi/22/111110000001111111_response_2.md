The issue with the provided `__init__` method is that it is attempting to use the `time` module without importing it. This will result in a `NameError` when the class is instantiated. To fix this, the `time` module needs to be imported at the beginning of the file.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import time  # import the time module at the beginning of the file

# class declaration containing the corrected __init__ method
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By importing the `time` module at the beginning of the file, the `time.time()` function will be accessible within the `__init__` method, and the `NameError` will be resolved.
