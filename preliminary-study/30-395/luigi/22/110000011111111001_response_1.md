The error occurs in the `init` method of the `Worker` class. The issue is that the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default, but in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class, it tries to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to `self.last_active`, resulting in a `TypeError` because it is trying to add an integer to `None`.

To fix this issue, we need to set a default value for `last_active` that can be used for comparison in the `prune` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `init` method of the `Worker` class:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=0):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By setting the default value of `last_active` to `0`, we ensure that it is always a valid value for comparison in the `prune` method.

After making this change, the `prune` method should work correctly without throwing a `TypeError` for adding an integer to `None`.
