Potential error location: The function is missing an import statement for the time module.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The error occurs because the time module is used in the function without being imported.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Import the time module at the beginning of the file to resolve the missing reference to 'time'.

Corrected code:

```python
import time  # Add this import statement at the beginning of the file

# class declaration containing the corrected function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
