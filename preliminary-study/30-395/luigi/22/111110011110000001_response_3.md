The error message indicates that there is a TypeError occurring during the execution of the test_worker_prune_after_init test case. The error is happening at the line `if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():` in the prune method of the Worker class.

The reason for the error is that the last_active attribute of the Worker class is being initialized to None, and the code in the prune method is attempting to add config.worker_disconnect_delay to last_active, resulting in the TypeError.

To fix this bug, we need to initialize last_active with the current time if it is None when the Worker object is instantiated.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import time

# class declaration containing the fixed function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the fixed function
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the last_active attribute of the Worker class will be initialized with the current time if it is None, preventing the TypeError in the prune method.
