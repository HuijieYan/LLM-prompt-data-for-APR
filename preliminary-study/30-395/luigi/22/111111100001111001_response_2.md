The potential error location within the problematic function is the initialization of the last_active and started variables. The bug is caused by using the same variable name (last_active) for the parameter and the class attribute, which leads to a conflict and incorrect initialization.

To fix the bug, the parameter last_active should be renamed to something else, and then the correct variable should be initialized using this new parameter name.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active_time=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active_time  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By renaming the parameter to last_active_time and then using it to initialize the last_active variable, the conflict is resolved and the function will work correctly.
