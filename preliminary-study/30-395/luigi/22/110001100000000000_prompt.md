# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)

    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
