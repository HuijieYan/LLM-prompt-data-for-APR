Potential error location: The error in the code is that the function is not defined as a class method. It seems like the intention is to create an __init__ method for a class, but it's missing the class definition.

Reason for the bug: The code is trying to create an __init__ method for a class, but it's missing the class definition. 

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add a class definition before the __init__ method.
2. Use the class name in place of "self" in the __init__ method.

Corrected code:

```python
class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
In this corrected code, we have added a class definition "Worker" and moved the __init__ method into the class, using "self" as the first parameter. This should fix the bug and allow the function to be used as intended within a class.
