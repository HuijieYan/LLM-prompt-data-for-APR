Potential error location: 
The error occurs at the line `if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():` in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class.

Reasons behind the bug:
The error occurs because the `last_active` parameter is initialized as `None`, and then it is used in an arithmetic operation with `config.worker_disconnect_delay`. This results in a `TypeError` because `None` is not a valid operand for the `+` operator.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Initialize `last_active` with a default value that makes sense in the context of the application, such as 0.
2. Check if `last_active` is `None` before performing any arithmetic operation with it.

Corrected code for the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class:
```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=0):  # Initialize last_active with a default value
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With the corrected `__init__` method, the `last_active` parameter is initialized with a default value of 0, preventing it from being `None`. This should resolve the `TypeError` when performing arithmetic operations with `last_active`.
