The error occurs in the `prune()` method of the `Worker` class. The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError` when trying to add `NoneType` and `int` in the line `if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():`. This indicates that `self.last_active` is `None` when it should be a `float`.

The bug occurred because the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class was assigned a default value of `None`, and this value was never updated. 

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is initialized with the current time if no value is provided.

Here is the corrected code for the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
With this correction, if `last_active` is not provided, it will default to the current time. This should fix the `TypeError` that was occurring in the `prune()` method.
