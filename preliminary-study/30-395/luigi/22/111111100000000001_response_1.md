Potential error location: The error may occur in the `__init__` method of the Worker class, especially in the line `self.started = time.time()` due to the `time` module not being imported.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `time` module is not currently imported, so the `time.time()` function will raise an error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Import the `time` module at the beginning of the file to resolve the NameError for `time`.

Corrected code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/luigi_22/luigi/scheduler.py

import time  # import the time module

# class declaration containing the corrected function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # corrected function
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
