The error occurs in the `prune()` method of the `Worker` class when it tries to add `self.last_active`, which is NoneType, with an integer `config.worker_disconnect_delay`. This results in the "TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'int'" error message.

The bug occurred because the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method can be set to `None`, and then when the `prune()` method is called, it tries to add `None` with an integer, resulting in a TypeError.

To fix this bug, the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method should be set to a default of `None` as it already is, but the `prune()` method should also account for the case when `last_active` is `None`. This could be done by adding a check to see if `last_active` is not `None` before performing the addition.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

And here's the corrected code for the `prune()` method:

```python
def prune(self, config):
    # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
    if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
        # Perform pruning logic here
```
