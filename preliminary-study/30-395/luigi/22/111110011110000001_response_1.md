Potential error location: The error is likely occurring because the `last_active` parameter is set as `None` by default in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class, causing a `TypeError` when it is used in the `prune` method.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug occurs because the `last_active` parameter is not being properly handled when it is `None`. The `prune` method does not account for the case when `last_active` is `None`, causing the `TypeError` when it tries to add `None` to an integer.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add a check in the `prune` method to handle the case when `last_active` is `None`.
2. Set a default value for `last_active` that is not `None` in the `__init__` method.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this corrected code, the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method will default to the current time if it is not provided, avoiding the `NoneType` error when it is used in the `prune` method.
