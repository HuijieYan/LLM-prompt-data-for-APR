Potential error location: The error seems to occur in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `last_active` attribute is initialized with a default value of `None` in the `__init__` method, and it is being used without being properly checked for `None` before performing arithmetic operations on it.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if `last_active` is not `None` before performing the arithmetic operation.
2. Set a default value for `last_active` if it is `None` in the `__init__` method.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # set default value to current time
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # perform pruning operation
            pass
```

By adding the condition to check for `None` in the `__init__` method and setting a default value for `last_active` in case it is `None`, the bug can be fixed. This will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring in the `prune` method.
