```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    import time  # Added import statement
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:  # Added condition to check if last_active is not None
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = 0
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
