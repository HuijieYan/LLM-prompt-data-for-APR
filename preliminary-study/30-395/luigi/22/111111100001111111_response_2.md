The bug in the __init__ method of the Worker class seems to be the reference to the time module without importing it. This causes a NameError when trying to access time.time().

To fix this, the time module needs to be imported within the scheduler.py file.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/luigi_22/luigi/scheduler.py
import time  # Add this line to import the time module

# class declaration containing the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # this is the corrected function
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch (now correctly accessing time.time())
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
