The potential error in the given buggy function is that it is missing an import statement for the `time` module, which is being used for the `time.time()` function call. This is causing the code to raise a `NameError` due to the missing reference to the `time` module.

To fix this bug, you need to add the following import statement at the beginning of the file:
```python
import time
```

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` function inside the `Worker` class:

```python
import time  # Add this import statement at the beginning of the file

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this import statement added, the `time` module will be available and the `time.time()` function will work as expected.
