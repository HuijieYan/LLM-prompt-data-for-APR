The potential error in the given buggy function is that it is missing the 'import time' statement, as it uses the time.time() function without importing the time module. This is likely causing a NameError when running the function.

To fix the bug, we need to import the time module at the beginning of the file. Then, we can use the 'time.time()' function to initialize the 'started' variable with the current time in seconds since epoch.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import time  # import the time module

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the code should now correctly initialize the 'started' variable and avoid the NameError.
