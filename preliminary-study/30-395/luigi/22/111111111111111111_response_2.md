The error is occurring in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class. The error indicates that there is an unsupported operand type for addition, specifically between a `NoneType` and an `int`.

Looking at the code, the issue is likely due to the `last_active` attribute being set to `None` in the `__init__` method. When trying to add the worker's last active time with the disconnect delay in the `prune` method, it causes a TypeError because `None` cannot be added to an integer.

To fix this issue, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` in the `prune` method. We can set a default value for `last_active` in the `__init__` method to avoid this issue.

Here's the corrected and updated `__init__` method for the `Worker` class:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """
    
    # ...omitted code...
    
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this change, the default value for `last_active` is set to the current time if it is not provided, preventing the TypeError in the `prune` method.

Now, when the `prune` method tries to add `last_active` with the disconnect delay, it will no longer result in a TypeError.
