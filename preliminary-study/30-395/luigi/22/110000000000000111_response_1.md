The potential error in the provided code is that the `time` module has not been imported, so the `time.time()` function will raise an error when trying to use it.

To fix this bug, we need to import the `time` module at the beginning of the script.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
