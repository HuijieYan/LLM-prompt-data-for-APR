The potential error in the `info` function is that the `Popen` object is not being waited for, so the `stdout` read is executed before the process finishes. This can result in an empty output or incorrect output.

To fix this, the `proc.communicate()` method should be used to wait for the process to finish before reading the `stdout`. This will ensure that the correct version of the Fish shell is obtained.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

class Fish(Generic):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = version.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected code, `proc.communicate()` is used to wait for the process to finish and obtain the output. Then the version is decoded from bytes to string and returned with the shell name.
