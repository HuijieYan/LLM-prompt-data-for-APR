The test case is trying to verify the output of the `info` method of the `Fish` class. It expects the method to return 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' and the `Popen` call arguments to be ['fish', '--version'].

The potential error is in the `info` method. The 'echo $FISH_VERSION' command is being used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell, but the command should be 'fish --version' according to the test case.

The bug occurred because the wrong command was used to get the version of the Fish shell. The `Popen` call should use 'fish --version' instead of 'echo $FISH_VERSION'.

To fix the bug, the `Popen` call should be updated to use the correct command to get the Fish shell version.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` method:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

class Fish(Generic):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
