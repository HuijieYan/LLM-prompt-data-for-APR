The error is occurring in the `test_info` method of the `TestFish` class. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert shell.info() == 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` failed.

The potential error in the `info` method of the `Fish` class is related to the command used to fetch the Fish shell version. The command in the `info` method is `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`, which is different from what the test case is expecting.

The reason for the bug is that the command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` does not return the version number in the correct format. It returns the output as 'fish, version 3.5.9' instead of just '3.5.9'.

To fix the bug, the command used to fetch the Fish shell version should be changed to `['fish', '--version']`, which is what the test case is expecting. This will ensure that the version string is returned in the correct format.

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```
