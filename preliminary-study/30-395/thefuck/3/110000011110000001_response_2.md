The test case is calling the `info` method of a `Fish` object and asserting that it should return the string 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'. The error message points out that the actual returned value is 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9' instead of 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'.

The potential error location within the `info` method is the command being executed using `Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],...)`. This command is requesting the version of the fish shell, but the response is different from what the test case expects.

The bug is occurring because the `Popen` command is using `echo $FISH_VERSION` which returns 'fish, version 3.5.9' instead of '3.5.9', as expected by the test case. This is causing the mismatch in the returned value from the method.

To fix the bug, the command executed by `Popen` needs to be modified to extract only the version number without any additional text. Additionally, the test case is asserting the wrong command, so that should be corrected as well.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return 'Fish Shell ' + version.split(', ')[1]
```

And the corrected test case:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_3/tests/shells/test_fish.py

def test_info(self, shell, Popen):
    Popen.return_value.stdout.read.side_effect = [b'fish, version 3.5.9\n']
    assert shell.info() == 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'
    assert Popen.call_args[0][0] == ['fish', '--version']
```
