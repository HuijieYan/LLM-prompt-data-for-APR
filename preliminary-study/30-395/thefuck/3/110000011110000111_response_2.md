1. The test case 'test_info' is checking if the 'info' method of the 'shell' object returns the expected string 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' after executing the 'Popen' command.

2. The potential error is the incorrect command being passed to 'Popen' in the 'info' method.

3. The bug occurs because the command passed to 'Popen' in the 'info' method is 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION', which outputs 'fish, version 3.5.9\n' instead of just the version number '3.5.9'. This causes the assertion to fail in the test case.

4. To fix the bug, the command passed to 'Popen' in the 'info' method should be changed to '['fish', '--version']' to get the version number directly. Additionally, the output should be processed to extract only the version number.

5. Corrected code for the 'info' method:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]  # Extracting only the version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
