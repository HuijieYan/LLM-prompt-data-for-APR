The potential error in the given function is that it is not properly importing the necessary modules, specifically the `subprocess` module, which contains the `Popen`, `PIPE`, and `DEVNULL` classes that are being used in the function.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the `subprocess` module has not been imported in the function, causing the `Popen` function to be undefined and leading to a NameError.

To fix the bug, we need to import the `subprocess` module at the beginning of the code.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import subprocess

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = subprocess.Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
