Potential error location: The issue might be with the usage of Popen and PIPE, and how the stdout is being read.

Reason for the bug: The Popen function is not being properly used to get the output from the fish shell and the stdout is not being correctly read.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: We can use the subprocess module to get the output from the shell command and then decode the output to get the version.

Corrected code:

```python
import subprocess

# class declaration containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = subprocess.Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], 
                                stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
