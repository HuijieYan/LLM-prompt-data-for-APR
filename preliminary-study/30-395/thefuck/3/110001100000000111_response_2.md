Potential error location:
The error is likely occurring in the `info` function within the `fish.py` file. The function is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell, but the method of doing so may be causing a hang or a recursive loop.

Reasons behind the bug:
The `info` function uses `Popen` to execute a command to retrieve the Fish shell version. However, this process may be causing a hang or a recursive loop due to the way it's implemented.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use a different method to retrieve the Fish shell version that doesn't cause a hang or recursive loop.
2. Handle any potential edge cases or errors that may be causing the hang or loop.
3. Consider using a different command or approach to achieve the same result without the negative side effects.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
from subprocess import run, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = run(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL, text=True)
    version = proc.stdout.strip()
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
