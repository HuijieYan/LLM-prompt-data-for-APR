The error message indicates that the `info` method is returning the version value along with the string "Fish Shell". This suggests that the formatting of the version is incorrect.

The potential error in the `info` method is the line `return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)`. It should be `return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)`.

The reason behind the bug is that the `u` prefix in the return statement is unnecessary and may be causing the issue with the formatting of the string.

To fix the bug, remove the `u` prefix from the return statement in the `info` method.

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
