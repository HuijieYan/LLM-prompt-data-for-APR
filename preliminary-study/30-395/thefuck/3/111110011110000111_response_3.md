The test case is checking the output of the `info` method of the `Fish` class. The error message shows that the output is not as expected, indicating that there is a problem with the `info` method.

The potential error location within the `info` method is the command used to get the Fish version. The `Popen` call with `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` is not returning the expected version string.

The reason behind the bug is that the command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` is not correctly returning the Fish version in the expected format.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to change the command used to get the Fish version. The correct command should be `['fish', '--version']` to get the version in the expected format.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` method:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(",")[1].strip())
```

In this corrected code, the `Popen` call uses `['fish', '--version']` to get the Fish version, and the version string is processed to extract the actual version number. This should fix the bug and make the `info` method return the expected Fish Shell version.
