Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is within the info() function in the shells/fish.py file.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the Popen() function is not being imported from the subprocess module, and DEVNULL is also not defined.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Import the Popen and DEVNULL from the subprocess module.
2. Use the communicate() method instead of stdout.read() to read the output of the Popen process.

Corrected Code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_3/thefuck/shells/fish.py
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
