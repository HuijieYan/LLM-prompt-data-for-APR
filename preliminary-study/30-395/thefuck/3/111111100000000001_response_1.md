Potential error location: The call to `proc.stdout.read()` without waiting for the process to finish might cause issues.

Reasons for the bug: The `proc.stdout.read()` function is called without waiting for the process to finish, which may result in an empty string being returned.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Use `proc.communicate()` to wait for the process to finish before reading the output.
- Use `check_output` from the `subprocess` module which handles the process creation and waits for it to finish.

Corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_3/thefuck/shells/fish.py

from subprocess import check_output

# class declaration containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        version = check_output(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']).decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
In the corrected code, the `check_output` function is used to execute the command and wait for its completion before capturing the output. This resolves the potential bug present in the original code.
