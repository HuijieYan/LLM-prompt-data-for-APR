The potential error in the provided function is that it's using a MagicMock object instead of actually executing the command to get the version of the shell.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the Popen function is being replaced by a MagicMock object, which is used for mocking purposes in unit tests. This means that the function is not actually executing the command to get the version of the shell, but it's using a mock object instead.

To fix the bug, the function should actually execute the command to get the version of the shell, instead of using a MagicMock object.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE, shell=True)
    version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
