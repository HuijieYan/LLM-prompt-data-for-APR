The error in the code is likely due to the fact that the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version is incorrect. The command 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION' should be replaced with 'fish --version' to retrieve the Fish shell version correctly. This is causing the assertion error in the test case, as the expected and actual shell version strings are different.

To fix the bug, the function `info` in the `Fish` class should be modified as follows:

```python
from typing import Union
import subprocess  # Import subprocess module for executing shell commands

# class declaration containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def info(self) -> Union[str, None]:
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            version = subprocess.check_output(['fish', '--version']).decode('utf-8').strip()
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        except subprocess.CalledProcessError:
            return None
```

In this corrected code, the `subprocess` module is used to execute the correct shell command 'fish --version', which will return the version of the Fish shell. The output is then decoded and stripped to obtain the version string, which is then returned in the specified format.

With this correction, the test case should pass without any assertion errors.
