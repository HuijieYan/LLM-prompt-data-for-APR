The error is occurring in the `Fish.info()` method. The `Popen` process is being mocked using `MagicMock`, which is causing the function to return a string containing the mocked values instead of executing the actual shell command.

The reason for the bug is that the `Popen` process is being mocked, so the function is not actually executing the shell command to get the version of the fish shell.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `Popen` process actually executes the shell command to get the version of the fish shell.

Here's the corrected code for the `Fish.info()` method:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE

class Fish(Generic):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE)  # Using PIPE for stderr
        version, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = version.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'fish, version {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected code, the `Popen` process actually executes the shell command to get the version of the fish shell, and the function will return the correct version of the fish shell.
