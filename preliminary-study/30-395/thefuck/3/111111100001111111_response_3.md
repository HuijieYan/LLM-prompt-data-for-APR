The issue seems to be with the `info` function in the `Fish` class, specifically with how it retrieves the version of the Fish shell. The function is using the `Popen` function to execute a command and capture the output, but it seems to be returning a MagicMock object instead of the actual shell version.

The reason for this bug is that the function is not executing the command properly or handling the output correctly. It seems to be returning a MagicMock object instead of the actual shell version.

To fix this bug, we need to make sure that the `Popen` function is executed properly and the output is read and decoded correctly to obtain the shell version.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

class Fish(Generic):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL, shell=True)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'fish, version {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected code, we have added `shell=True` parameter in the `Popen` function to execute the command in a shell. This should ensure that the command is executed properly to get the shell version. Then we read and decode the output to obtain the shell version and return it in the expected format.
