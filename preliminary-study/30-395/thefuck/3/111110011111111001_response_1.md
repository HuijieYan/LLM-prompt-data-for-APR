The problem seems to be in the `info` method of the `Fish` class, where the version number retrieved from the shell is not being properly formatted.

The `Popen` call is using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` to get the version number of the shell, but the returned value is not being formatted correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to change the `info` method to use the correct command to get the shell version, and format the output string accordingly.

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```
