The bug seems to be in the 'info' method of the Fish class. This method is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell, but it uses the 'Popen' function, which might be causing the issue.

The reason for the bug could be that the 'Popen' function is not being called correctly, or it might be returning unexpected values. It's also possible that the 'Popen' function is causing a recursive loop, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we can use the 'subprocess' module instead of 'Popen' and 'PIPE'. Additionally, we can modify the command to get the shell version.

Here's the corrected code for the 'info' method:

```python
import subprocess

class Fish(Generic):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        version = subprocess.check_output(['fish', '--version']).decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using 'subprocess.check_output(['fish', '--version'])', we can directly get the version of the fish shell without using 'Popen' and 'PIPE'. This should fix the bug and prevent any potential recursive loops.
