The issue lies in the `info` function. The function is supposed to retrieve the version of the fish shell and return it in a specific format. However, the function is currently not fetching the `fish` version correctly and not formatting the output as expected. This is causing the test to fail.

The `Popen` command is using the argument `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` to retrieve the `fish` version, but it should be using `['fish', '--version']` instead. Additionally, it is expected that the output should include the string `'fish, version'`, and it should be formatted as `Fish Shell <version>`.

To fix the issue, change the command to `['fish', '--version']` and parse the output to extract the version and format it accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split("\n")[0].split(", ")[1]  # Extracting the version from the output
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this change, the function should now correctly fetch the version and format it as expected.
