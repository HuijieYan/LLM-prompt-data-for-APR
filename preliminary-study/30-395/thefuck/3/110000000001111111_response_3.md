Potential error location: The issue is likely with the Popen function call, which is causing the function to hang.

Reasons behind the bug: The Popen function is not being called correctly, leading to the function hanging and not returning the expected output.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the Popen function is called with the correct arguments and in a way that allows it to complete and return the expected output.
2. Check for any potential infinite loops or recursive calls that may be causing the function to hang.
3. Verify that the environment variables required for the function to run are set correctly.

Corrected code:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], shell=True, stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
In the corrected code, we use the `communicate()` method of the `proc` object to read the output, and we also set `shell=True` in the `Popen` call to ensure the command is executed within the shell. These changes should help in resolving the hanging issue and return the expected output.
