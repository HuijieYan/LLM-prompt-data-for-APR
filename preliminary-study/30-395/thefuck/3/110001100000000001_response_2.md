The potential error in the given function is with the usage of `Popen` and `PIPE` without importing the necessary modules. The error occurs because the code is trying to use `Popen` and `PIPE` without importing them from the `subprocess` module.

To fix this bug, we need to import the required modules and then use the `subprocess.run` function to execute the shell command more efficiently.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import subprocess

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    version = subprocess.run(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], capture_output=True, text=True).stdout.strip()
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
