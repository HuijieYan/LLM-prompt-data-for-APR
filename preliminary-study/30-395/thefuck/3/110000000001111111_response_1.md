The error in the provided code seems to be in the `info` method of the `Fish` class. The method is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell, but it is using the `Popen` function without importing it. 

Additionally, it seems that the method is using MagicMock objects for `proc` and related variables, which may be causing unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to import the `Popen` function from the `subprocess` module, and then use it to get the version of the Fish shell.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` method:

```python
import subprocess

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = subprocess.Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                            stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By importing the `subprocess` module and using the `Popen` function from it, we can correctly retrieve the version of the Fish shell and avoid the use of MagicMock objects. This should fix the bug and allow the `info` method to return the expected value and type.
