1. The test case is checking the output of the `info` function of the `Fish` class, which is expected to return the version of the Fish shell. The test mock returns the version 'fish, version 3.5.9' and the test fails due to an assertion error.

2. The potential error location is in the `info` method of the `Fish` class, where the version string is not being properly extracted from the output of the subprocess.

3. The bug occurs because the code is trying to extract the version of the Fish shell by running a subprocess and fetching the output. However, the output is not being parsed correctly, resulting in an incorrect version string.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Use the `subprocess.run` method to capture the output of the command more cleanly.
   b. Change the command to `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION` to directly get the shell version.
   c. Parse the output of the subprocess to extract the version string correctly.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `info` method of the `Fish` class:

```python
from subprocess import run, PIPE

class Fish(Generic):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = run(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, text=True)
        version = proc.stdout.strip()
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```
