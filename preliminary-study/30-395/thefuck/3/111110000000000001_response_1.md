The potential error in the provided code is that it is using the `Popen` class without importing it. Additionally, the `Generic` class is not imported, so it needs to be imported if it's a requirement for the `Fish` class.

The reason for the bug is that the `Popen` class is not accessible from the current context because it has not been imported. 

To fix the bug:
1. Import the necessary classes at the beginning of the file.
2. Use the `subprocess` module to access the `Popen` class.
3. Handle any potential exceptions when running the subprocess.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` method:

```python
import subprocess
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

# class declaration containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = subprocess.Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                                    stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        except Exception as e:
            return "Error retrieving Fish Shell version: {}".format(str(e))
```
