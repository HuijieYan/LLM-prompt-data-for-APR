The error occurs in the `info` method of the `Fish` class. The method is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell (Fish Shell), but it is using the `Popen` function without importing it or defining it. This causes the function to fail.

To fix the bug, the `Popen` function needs to be imported from the `subprocess` module. Additionally, it's good practice to handle exceptions that may occur when using the `Popen` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` method:

```python
import subprocess

class Fish(Generic):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = subprocess.Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                                    stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)
            version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        except Exception as e:
            return "Error getting Fish Shell version: {}".format(e)
```

By importing the `subprocess` module and handling exceptions, the `info` method should now work as expected.
