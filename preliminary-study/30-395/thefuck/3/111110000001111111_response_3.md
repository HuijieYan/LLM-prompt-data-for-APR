The error seems to be in the `info` method of the `Fish` class. The function uses the Popen and DEVNULL classes without importing them, which will cause a NameError when the function is called. Additionally, the function seems to be returning a string in an unexpected format.

To fix the bug, we need to import the required modules, handle any potential errors, and modify the return value to match the expected output.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` method:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

# class declaration containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
            proc.stdout.close()
            return 'Fish Shell, version {}'.format(version)
        except Exception as e:
            return 'Error retrieving Fish Shell version: {}'.format(e)

```
With these changes, the function should now work as expected.
