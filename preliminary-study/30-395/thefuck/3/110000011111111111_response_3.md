The error occurs in the `info` function, where the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` is being executed using `Popen` in order to get the version of the fish shell. However, the command being executed in the test `['fish', '--version']` does not match the command in the `info` function, which is `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`. 

To fix the bug, we need to change the command being executed in the `info` function to `['fish', '--version']` so it matches the expected input in the test case.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this change, the `info` function will correctly execute the `fish --version` command and return the expected version of the Fish Shell.
