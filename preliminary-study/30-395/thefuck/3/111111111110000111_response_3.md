1. The test case is attempting to test the `info` method of the `Fish` class. It expects the method to return the version of the Fish shell. However, it is failing with an assertion error because the returned value includes extra information "fish, version" which is not expected by the test case.

2. The potential error location within the `info` method seems to be the command used to retrieve the Fish version.

3. The bug occurs because the command used to retrieve the Fish version is incorrect. The command `echo $FISH_VERSION` returns "fish, version" along with the version number, causing the returned value to include the extra information.

4. To fix the bug, the command used to retrieve the version needs to be updated to correctly return only the version number.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `info` method:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_info = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version_info.split(', ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected code, the method will use the `--version` option to retrieve the version information and then extract only the version number from the returned string. This should fix the bug and make the test case pass.
