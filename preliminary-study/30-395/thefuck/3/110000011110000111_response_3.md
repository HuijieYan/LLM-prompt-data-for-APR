1. The test case is checking the output of the `shell.info()` method, which is expected to return the version of the Fish shell. The test case is also setting up the mock behavior for Popen to return a specific output when called with the command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`.

2. The potential error location within the `info` method is the command being passed to Popen and the way the output is being processed.

3. The error occurred because the command passed to Popen is `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`, but in the test case, the expected call is `['fish', '--version']`. Additionally, the method is reading the output from Popen and processing it incorrectly, leading to an extra 'fish, version' string in the result.

4. To fix the bug, the command passed to Popen should be `['fish', '--version']` to align with the expected call in the test case. Additionally, the method should process the output correctly to remove the extra 'fish, version' string.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.replace('fish, version ', '')  # remove 'fish, version' from the output
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
