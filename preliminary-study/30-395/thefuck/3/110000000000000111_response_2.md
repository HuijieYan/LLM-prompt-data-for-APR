Potential error location: The issue might be with the use of Popen and PIPE in the info method, as it seems to be causing a recursive loop when called from the TheFuck plugin.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: When the TheFuck plugin uses the command 'thefuck -v', it triggers the info method in the Fish shell, which in turn uses Popen and PIPE, leading to a recursive loop.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: One possible approach to fix the bug is to avoid using Popen and PIPE within the info method. Instead, a different method of retrieving the shell version should be used to prevent the recursive loop.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import os

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    version = os.getenv('FISH_VERSION')
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
In the corrected code, the info method retrieves the shell version using os.getenv('FISH_VERSION') instead of using Popen and PIPE, thus avoiding the recursive loop caused by the TheFuck plugin.
