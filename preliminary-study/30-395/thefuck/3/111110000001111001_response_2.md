The potential error in the provided code is that the `Popen` function from the `subprocess` module is being mocked and is returning a MagicMock object instead of actually executing the command and returning the output.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `Popen` function is being mocked and is not actually executing the command to retrieve the Fish shell version.

To fix this bug, the `subprocess` module should be imported and the `Popen` function should be called with the command to retrieve the Fish shell version. This will ensure that the correct version of the Fish shell is retrieved and returned.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` method:

```python
import subprocess

class Fish(Generic):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = subprocess.Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                                stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
