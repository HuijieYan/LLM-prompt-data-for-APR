# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
thefuck -v hangs Fish Shell initialisation with Oh-My-Fish plugin
```

## The associated detailed issue description
```text
Oh-My-Fish's TheFuck plugin uses thefuck -v to decide when to regenerate functions. That triggers a recursive loop because of shells/fish.py:Fish.info().

Fix is on it's way.
