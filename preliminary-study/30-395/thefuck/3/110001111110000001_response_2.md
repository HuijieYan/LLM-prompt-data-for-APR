The test case `test_info` is calling the `info` method of the `Fish` class and asserting that the output should be 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'. However, the test is failing because the actual output includes the string 'fish, version' before the version number. 

The potential error location is the line where the `info` function is getting the version of the fish shell. The `Popen` call is using the argument `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` to retrieve the fish shell version, but it should be using `['fish', '--version']` instead.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the command used to retrieve the shell version is incorrect, leading to the inclusion of unnecessary text in the output.

To fix the bug, the correct command to get the version of the fish shell should be used. 

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

class Fish:
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(',')[1].strip())
```

With this correction, the `info` function should now work correctly, and the output should be 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' as expected.
