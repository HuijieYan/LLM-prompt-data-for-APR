The error occurs in the `info` method of the `Fish` class. The method is supposed to return the name and version of the Fish shell, but it is currently returning just the version number.

The reason for the bug is that the command used to get the Fish shell version is incorrect, and it is not capturing the "Fish Shell" part of the version string.

To fix the bug, the command used to get the Fish shell version should be corrected, and the method should be updated to include "Fish Shell" in the returned string.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` method:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the method should now return "Fish Shell 3.5.9" as expected.
