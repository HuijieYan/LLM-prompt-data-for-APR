Potential Error Location:
The potential error lies in the usage of the Popen function from the subprocess module. The Popen function is used to create a new process but it has not been properly imported in the provided code.

Reason for the Bug:
The Popen function is not directly accessible in the code because it has not been imported. This leads to a NameError when trying to use the Popen function.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Import the required module (subprocess) to access the Popen function.
2. Use the subprocess.run function or other appropriate subprocess function for running the command.

Corrected Function:

```python
import subprocess

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = subprocess.Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```
