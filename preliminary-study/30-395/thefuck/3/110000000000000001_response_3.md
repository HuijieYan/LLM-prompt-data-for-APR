The potential error in the code is with the usage of the `Popen` function. It seems that the necessary imports for `Popen`, `PIPE`, and `DEVNULL` are missing.

The error is likely occurring because the necessary modules and classes from the `subprocess` module are not being imported into the code.

To fix this bug, the `subprocess` module needs to be imported at the beginning of the code. Additionally, the `PIPE` and `DEVNULL` constants need to be imported from the `subprocess` module.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import subprocess
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
