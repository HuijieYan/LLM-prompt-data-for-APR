The error in the provided function is due to the incorrect command used to retrieve the Fish shell version. The command used is `echo $FISH_VERSION`, which is not the correct way to retrieve the version.

The error message in the test function indicates that the output from the `shell.info()` method includes the phrase "Fish Shell" followed by the full output of the `Popen` call, instead of just the version number.

To fix the bug:
1. Use the correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version, which is `fish --version`.
2. Modify the `Popen` call to use the correct command and remove the incorrect one.
3. Update the `info` method to only return the version number extracted from the output.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` method:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE


class Fish(Generic):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE)  # Use the correct command to get the version
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', ')[1]  # Extract only the version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With the corrected code, the `info` method will now correctly extract the version number and return it in the format "Fish Shell X.X.X". This should resolve the assertion error in the test case.
