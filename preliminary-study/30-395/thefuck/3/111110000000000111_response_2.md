Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the `info` method of the `Fish` class, where it tries to retrieve the version of the Fish shell.

Reasons for the bug: The `info` method currently uses the `Popen` function to execute a command and retrieve the Fish shell version, but it doesn't handle the `stderr` properly. This can lead to unexpected behavior, especially in scenarios where the command execution might hang or cause a recursive loop.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Properly handle the `stderr` to avoid hanging or recursive loop issues.
2. Use a different method to retrieve the Fish shell version that doesn't cause these issues.

Corrected code for the `info` method:
```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

class Fish(Generic):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = version.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```
