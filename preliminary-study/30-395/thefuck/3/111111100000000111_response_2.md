Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the usage of the "thefuck -v" command triggering a recursive loop because of the Fish.info() function.

Reasons behind the bug: The current implementation of the Fish.info() function in the Fish class is causing a recursive loop when the "thefuck -v" command is used, thus leading to the bug.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: We can use a different approach to determine the Fish shell version without triggering a recursive loop.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected code, we have replaced the usage of the "echo $FISH_VERSION" command with "fish --version" to determine the Fish shell version without causing a recursive loop.
