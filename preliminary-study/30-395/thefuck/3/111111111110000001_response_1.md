Potential error location: The potential error is in the line `version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()`, where the code is reading the output of the `fish --version` command and incorrectly extracting the version.

Reasons for the bug: The bug is occurring because the code is using the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command instead of `fish --version` to extract the version information. Additionally, the way the output is being parsed and formatted is incorrect.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, the code should be modified to use the `fish --version` command to extract the version information and then parse and format the output correctly.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(",")[1].strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
