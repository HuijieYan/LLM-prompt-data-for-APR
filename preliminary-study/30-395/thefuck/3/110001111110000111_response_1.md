1. The test case is attempting to assert that the output of the `shell.info()` function is equal to 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'. The error message indicates that the expected output is 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' but the actual output is 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'.

2. The potential error location within the `info` function is the command used to get the Fish shell version.

3. The bug is occurring because the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is being used to get the version, but the actual output includes the string 'fish, version' which is not being handled properly.

4. To fix the bug, we can modify the command used to fetch the fish version by using `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`. This command will give us the version directly, without any extra text.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

class Fish:
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

With the above correction, the function will now properly extract the version from the output of `fish --version`, and the test case should pass without any assertion errors.
