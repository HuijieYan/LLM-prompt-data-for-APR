The issue with the provided function is that the `Popen` function is not being imported. This is indicated by the variable `proc` being assigned to `MagicMock`, which is a mock object used for testing, rather than the expected `Popen` object.

To fix this issue, we need to import the `Popen` function from the `subprocess` module. Additionally, using `communicate()` method is a better option to capture the output of the command as opposed to reading directly from the `stdout`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import subprocess

class Fish(Generic):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = subprocess.Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                                stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
