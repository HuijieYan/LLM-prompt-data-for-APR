1. The test case involves using the Oh-My-Fish plugin with TheFuck to trigger a recursive loop when using the command thefuck -v with Fish Shell and Oh-My-Fish plugin.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of Popen without importing it and also missing the import statements for Popen, PIPE, and DEVNULL.

3. The error occurs because the Popen function and its required imports are not defined in the provided code. This leads to a NameError when trying to use Popen, PIPE, and DEVNULL.

4. To fix the bug, the required imports and Popen statement need to be added to the code. Additionally, error handling should be added to avoid potential exceptions.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_3/thefuck/shells/fish.py
import subprocess
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        proc = subprocess.Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                                stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    except Exception as e:
        return f'Error: {e}'
```

This corrected code includes the necessary imports for subprocess and Popen, as well as error handling with a try-except block to handle any potential exceptions.
