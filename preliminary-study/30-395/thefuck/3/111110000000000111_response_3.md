Potential error location:
The issue seems to stem from the use of the `thefuck -v` command triggering a recursive loop because of the `Fish.info()` function in the `shells/fish.py` file.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The `Fish.info()` function is using the `Popen` and `PIPE` classes incorrectly, causing it to hang and potentially trigger a recursive loop when called with certain commands, such as `thefuck -v`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use the `subprocess.run` function instead of `Popen` to execute the shell command.
2. Check for the command being executed and handle it differently to avoid recursive loops.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import subprocess

# class declaration containing the fixed function
class Fish(Generic):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # the fixed function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = subprocess.run(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     capture_output=True, text=True)
        version = proc.stdout.strip()
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
