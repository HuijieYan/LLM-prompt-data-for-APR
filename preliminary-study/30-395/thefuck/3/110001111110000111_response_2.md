1. The test case is checking the output of the `info` method of the `Fish` class in the `fish.py` file. The test case is expecting the output "Fish Shell 3.5.9" but is instead receiving "Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9", leading to an assertion error.

2. The potential error location within the `info` method is the command used to get the Fish shell version.

3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version is incorrect, leading to an unexpected format in the output.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Update the command to retrieve the Fish shell version to accurately capture the version number without extra text.
   - Modify the `info` method to process the version number from the command output in the expected format.

5. Corrected code for the `info` method:
```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

class Fish:
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'fish --version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', ')[1]
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
In this corrected code, we modified the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version to 'fish --version' and processed the output to extract just the version number. This should provide the expected output "Fish Shell 3.5.9" and pass the test case.
