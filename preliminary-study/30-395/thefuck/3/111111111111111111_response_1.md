The test case provides the input and expected output for the `info` method of the `Fish` class. The error message indicates that the actual output is "Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9" while the expected output is "Fish Shell 3.5.9".

The error seems to be in the `info` method where the returned string includes the word "fish," and a comma before the version number, while the test expects only the version number. This indicates that the `info` method is not formatting the version number correctly.

The reason behind the bug is that the format of the string returned by the `info` method does not match the expected output in the test case.

To fix the bug, the `info` method should be modified to format the version number correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` method:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.replace('fish, version ', ''))
```

The corrected code utilizes `str.replace` to remove the unnecessary string "fish, version " and format the version number as expected by the test case.
