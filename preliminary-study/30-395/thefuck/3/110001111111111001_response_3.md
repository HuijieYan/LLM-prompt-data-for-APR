Potential error location: The issue may be with the command used to get the Fish shell version. The command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` does not match the expected call arguments in the test function `['fish', '--version']`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The command used in the `info` function to get the Fish shell version is different from the expected command in the test function. This mismatch leads to the assertion error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the command in the `info` function to match the expected call arguments in the test function.
2. Modify the test case to match the command used in the `info` function.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_3/thefuck/shells/fish.py

from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

class Fish:
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

Updated test function:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_3/tests/shells/test_fish.py

class TestFish:
    def test_info(self, shell, Popen):
        Popen.return_value.stdout.read.side_effect = [b'fish, version 3.5.9\n']
        assert shell.info() == 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'
        assert Popen.call_args[0][0] == ['fish', '--version']
```
