The potential error in the problematic function is the command used to get the Fish shell version. The `Popen` command is currently set to use `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` to retrieve the version. However, the test case expects the command to be `['fish', '--version']`. This indicates that the incorrect command is being used to obtain the version, leading to the version number being different from what the test expects.

To fix the bug, the command in the `Popen` function needs to be changed to `['fish', '--version']` to align with the expectations of the test case.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
