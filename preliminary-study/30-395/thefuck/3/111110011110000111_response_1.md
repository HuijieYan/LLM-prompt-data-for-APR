The test case is checking the output of the `shell.info()` function and expects it to be 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'. However, the actual output is 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'. This indicates that the bug is likely in the `info()` function where the version string is not being correctly processed.

The reason behind the bug is that the version string obtained from the command output includes the 'fish, version' part, which is not needed in the final output.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info()` function to extract the version number from the command output and return it in the correct format.

Here's the corrected code for the `info()` function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE

class Fish(Generic):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        out, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = out.decode('utf-8').strip().split(' ')[-1]
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected code, we use `Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)` to obtain the version output without needing to parse any variables. Then, we extract the version number from the output and return it in the correct format.
