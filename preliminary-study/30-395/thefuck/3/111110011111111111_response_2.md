The main issue seems to be the use of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command in the `info` method of the `Fish` class. This command is intended to retrieve the version of the Fish shell, but it appears that it is returning "fish, version 3.5.9" instead of just "3.5.9".

The issue might be related to the way the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command is being executed and the subsequent processing of its output.

Based on the provided error message from the test function, it seems that the function is returning "Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9" instead of "Fish Shell 3.5.9". This discrepancy in the returned value is causing the assertion error in the test.

To fix the bug, the `info` function needs to be modified to correctly extract and process the version information from the output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', ')[1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`, we can retrieve the complete version string. Then, using `split(', ')[1]`, we extract the version number from the string. This should align the output with the expected value and type, resolving the assertion error in the test.
