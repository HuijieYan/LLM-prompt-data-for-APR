Potential error location: The issue seems to be with reading the output from the `proc` process.

Reasons behind the bug: The `proc.stdout.read()` method is returning a MagicMock object, which is not the expected behavior.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Instead of using `proc.stdout.read()`, we can use `proc.communicate()[0]` to read the output from the process.

Corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_3/thefuck/shells/fish.py

# class declaration containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # the corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
