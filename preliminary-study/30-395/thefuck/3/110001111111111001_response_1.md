Potential error location:
The problem lies in the `info` function, specifically in how the version string is being formatted and returned.

Reason behind the bug:
The bug occurred because the function is trying to match the exact string 'Fish Shell 3.5.9', but the actual output from the shell command contains 'fish, version 3.5.9'.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to extract the version string from the output of the shell command and format it as 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

class Fish:
    def info(self):
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extract the version number from the output
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
