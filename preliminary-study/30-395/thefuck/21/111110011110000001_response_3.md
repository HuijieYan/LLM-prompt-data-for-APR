The error message indicates that there is an "IndexError" in the function "match" at line 32 of the file "thefuck/specific/git.py". The "IndexError" is caused by trying to split the "command.script" attribute but not checking if there are enough elements in the resulting list.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the line:
```python
return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
        and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code blindly assumes that the "command.script" attribute will always have at least two elements when split by whitespace. However, in this specific case, it seems that the "command.script" does not contain enough elements to split and retrieve the second element.

To fix this bug, you can check if the split list contains at least two elements before trying to access the second element. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
