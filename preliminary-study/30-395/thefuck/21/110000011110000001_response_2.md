Potential error location: The error is occurring in the line "return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)".

Reason for the bug: The error message "IndexError: list index out of range" indicates that the split() function does not have a second element in the list, which is causing the index out of range error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the split() function returns a list with at least two elements before accessing the second element.
2. Also, handle the case where the 'stash' keyword is not present in the command script to prevent the index out of range error.

Corrected code:

```python
# corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) > 1:
        return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
```
