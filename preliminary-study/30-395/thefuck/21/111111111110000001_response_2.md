Potential Error Location: The error seems to be occurring in the `match` function, specifically in the line `command.script.split()[1]`. This line is trying to split the script of the command and access the second element of the resulting list, which may be causing an IndexError.

Reason for Bug: The bug is likely occurring because the `command.script` does not contain any spaces, so when split is called on it, the resulting list may not have an element at the index 1, leading to an IndexError.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the length of the split list is greater than 1 before accessing the second element to avoid IndexError.
2. Verify the command.script to ensure it contains the expected structure before attempting to split it and access specific elements.

Corrected Code:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and
            script_parts[1] == 'stash' and
            'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
