The issue seems to be related to the `command.script.split()[1]` portion of the `match` function. The error message indicates that the index is out of range, which means that either there is no second element in the split list or the split list is empty.

Upon reviewing the code, it seems that the function is expecting the `command.script` to contain the word "stash" as the second word after splitting the script by whitespace. However, in the provided test case, the `command.script` is just "git". This causes the split operation to result in a list with only one element ('git'), and accessing the second element with index 1 causes an IndexError.

To fix this issue, the function should first check if the split result contains more than one element before trying to access the second element. Additionally, it should also check for the occurrence of 'stash' in the split result. 

Here's the corrected function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In this corrected code, we first split the script and store the result in a variable `split_script`. Then we check if the split result contains more than one element, and if the second element is 'stash'. These conditions will prevent the IndexError from occurring and make the function more robust.
