Potential error location: The error occurs in the `match` function of the file `git_fix_stash.py`, specifically at the line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` where it tries to access the second element of the split command script without checking if it exists.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug occurs because the function assumes that the command script will always have at least 2 elements after splitting, which is not always the case. In the provided test case, the command script is just 'git' which results in an empty split list, leading to an IndexError when trying to access the second element.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: We need to first check if the split list has enough elements to access the second element before performing the comparison.

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
