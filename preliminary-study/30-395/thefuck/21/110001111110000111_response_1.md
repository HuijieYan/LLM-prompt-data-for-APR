The test case is checking if the match function doesn't match when the command is just "git" with a specific stderr message. The error message indicates an IndexError at line 8 of the match function, specifically at `command.script.split()[1]`.

The bug occurs because the `split()` method is called without checking if the `script` attribute is empty or contains enough elements to split. This results in an IndexError when trying to access the second element of the split list.

To fix the bug, we should first check if the `script` attribute is not empty and contains enough elements to split before accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected code for the match function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In this corrected code, we first split the `script` attribute into parts and then check if the split list contains more than 1 element before trying to access the second element. This prevents the IndexError from occurring.
