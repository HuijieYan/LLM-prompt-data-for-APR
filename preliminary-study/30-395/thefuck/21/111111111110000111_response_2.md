The test function is trying to pass a Command object with "git" as the script and git_stash_err as the stderr to the match function. The error message indicates that there's an IndexError on line 8 of the git_fix_stash.py file, which is within the match function.

The bug is occurring because the script.split() call assumes that there will always be at least two elements in the list after splitting by whitespace. However, when the script is just "git" and not "git stash", this assumption fails, leading to an IndexError.

To fix the bug, the match function needs to first check if the length of the command.script.split() is greater than 1 before accessing the second element to compare it with 'stash'. If the length is not greater than 1, then the condition for checking if the second element is 'stash' should be skipped.

Here's the corrected code for the match function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
