The bug in the provided function is that it is using a decorator `@git_support` which is not defined in the given code. This is causing the function to throw an error when executed.

To fix this, we can remove the `@git_support` decorator from the function. Additionally, we can modify the function to check if the command.script contains the word 'git' and the command.stderr contains the phrase 'usage:'. 

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
def match(command):
    return ('git' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
