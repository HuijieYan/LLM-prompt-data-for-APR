The issue is that the `command.script` attribute is just 'git', which does not have a space-separated second element. This is causing the `command.script.split()[1]` expression to throw an IndexError.

To fix this issue, we need to check if the `command.script` is a valid command and also check if the second element of the split command is 'stash'.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
# this is the fixed function
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and
            split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected code, we first split the command and check if the split has more than one element. If it does, we then check if the second element is 'stash'. This way, we avoid the IndexError and also make sure the command is valid before accessing its elements.
