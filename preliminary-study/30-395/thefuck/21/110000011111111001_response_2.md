The error occurs at the line `command.script.split()[1]` in the match function. The error message "IndexError: list index out of range" indicates that `command.script.split()` does not contain an item at index 1, causing the program to crash.

This error occurs because `command.script` is being split and checked for the second element directly, assuming that it contains at least two elements. However, in the given input, `command.script` is only 'git', so when split, it results in a list with only one element.

To fix this, we need to add a condition to check if the split list contains at least two elements before trying to access the second element.

Updated/corrected function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) >= 2 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
