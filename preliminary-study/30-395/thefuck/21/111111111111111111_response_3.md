The error message indicates that there is an "IndexError: list index out of range" within the `match` function at line 8 in the file thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py. This suggests that the buggy line is `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`, meaning that the `split()` method may not be creating the expected list. The bug occurs when the `split()` method is unable to create a list with at least two elements, causing the index out of range error.

This issue happens because the buggy function `match` assumes that the `command.script` will always have multiple words. This assumption is incorrect when the input command is just 'git', as in the failing test case. Therefore, the `split()` method creates a single-element list, and accessing the second element with index 1 leads to an IndexError.

To fix this issue, we can first check if the length of the split list is at least 2 before trying to access the second element. If the length is less than 2, we can safely return False, indicating that the match condition was not met. Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

With this fix, we check if the length of the split list is greater than 1 before accessing the second element. If the length is less than 2, the function will return False, preventing the IndexError.
