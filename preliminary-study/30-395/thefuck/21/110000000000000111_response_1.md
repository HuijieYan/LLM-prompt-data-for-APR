The error occurred because the function is assuming that the `command.script` will always contain at least two elements when split by whitespace. However, in this specific case, the `command.script` is just "git" and does not contain a second element.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the split operation actually produces at least two elements, and then check the second element for 'stash'.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
# corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    command_split = command.script.split()
    return (len(command_split) > 1 and command_split[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
