The buggy function is a part of a larger system that handles Git commands. It checks if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the stderr includes the word 'usage:'. If both conditions are met, the function returns True.

The bug occurs because the function splits the command script by spaces and then checks if the second word is 'stash'. This assumption may not always hold true, as the actual command might have a different structure or additional parameters.

To fix this bug, we can update the function to check if 'stash' is in the command script instead of comparing the second word. This would make the check more flexible and avoid potential issues with different command structures.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return 'stash' in command.script and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
