The bug in the provided function is that it is trying to access the second element of the `command.script` which is causing an `IndexError` when the `command.script` is just equal to 'git'. This is happening because `command.script.split()[1]` attempts to access the second element of the split result, but there is only one element in the split result in this case.

To fix this bug, we need to check the length of the split result before trying to access the second element. We can also check if the first element of the split result is 'git' to ensure that we are working with Git commands.

The corrected function is provided below:

```python
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[0] == 'git':
        return (script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```

This corrected function first checks if the length of `script_parts` is greater than 1 and the first element is 'git', and then proceeds to check if the second element is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the `command.stderr`. If these conditions are met, then it returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.
