The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the `command.script` contains the word "stash" and if the `command.stderr` contains the word "usage:". However, the current implementation is incorrect and needs to be fixed.

The potential error in the code is the way it splits the `command.script` and checks for the second element, as well as the way it checks for the presence of "usage:" in `command.stderr`.

The buggy function is trying to split the `command.script` using the `split()` method without a separator, which will result in `splited_script` being `['git']`, and then it compares the second element with 'stash'. This comparison will always return False, as 'stash' is not the second element in the list.

Additionally, the comparison for 'usage:' in the `command.stderr` should be performed using the `in` operator, not equality.

To fix the code, the correct approach is to split the `command.script` by space and then check if 'stash' is in the resulting list. And for `command.stderr`, we need to check if 'usage:' is in the string.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
# this is the fixed function
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script.split()
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
