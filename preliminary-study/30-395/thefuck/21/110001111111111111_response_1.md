The error occurs when the `match` function tries to access the second element of the list returned by `command.script.split()`. The issue is that the `split()` method returns a list with only one element when the script is just "git", causing an IndexError when trying to access the second element.

To fix this issue, we need to add a condition to check if the length of the split list is greater than or equal to 2 before trying to access the second element.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This modification ensures that the code will only attempt to access the second element of the split script when it actually exists, preventing the IndexError.
