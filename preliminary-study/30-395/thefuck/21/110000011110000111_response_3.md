The error message indicates that there is an "IndexError" in the function "match" at line 8. This likely occurs when trying to split the "command.script" into a list and accessing the second element which does not exist if the input is just "git".

The potential error location is the line "return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)".

The bug occurs because the function is assuming that there will always be at least two elements obtained after splitting "command.script", but this is not the case when command.script is just "git".

To fix the bug, we can first check if the first element of the split command.script is "git" before accessing the second element to avoid the IndexError.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
# Corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In this corrected function, we first split the command.script into parts and then check if the length of the resulting list is greater than 1 to avoid the IndexError.
