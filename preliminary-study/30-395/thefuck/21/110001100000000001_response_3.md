Potential Error Location: The error could be occurring in the conditional statement within the match function. The function is trying to check if the command script contains the word 'stash' and if the command stderr contains 'usage:'. 

Reason for the Bug: The bug might be occurring because the split() operation on command.script may not always produce a list with a second element, leading to an IndexError. Additionally, the equality check is not robust and may fail in some cases.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: We need to add error handling for the split operation and use a more robust condition for checking the command script.

Corrected Code:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[0] == 'git' and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
