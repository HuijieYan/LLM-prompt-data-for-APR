The error message indicates an "IndexError" occurring on line 8 in the provided function. This suggests that the code is trying to access an index in a list that does not exist, which is causing the error.

The potential error location within the function is the line: 
```python
command.script.split()[1]
```
This line tries to split the script attribute of the command object and access the second element. If the script attribute does not contain any spaces, then this code will result in an IndexError.

The bug is occurring because the code assumes that there will always be at least two elements after splitting the script attribute by spaces. However, in the given test case, the script attribute contains only one element ('git').

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the split command does not result in an IndexError. One possible approach is to check the length of the split result before trying to access the second element.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the code first checks if the split result has at least two elements before attempting to access the second element. This will prevent the IndexError from occurring.
