The potential error in the given code is that the function is splitting the command.script and checking if the second part is 'stash'. However, the code is not checking if the command.stderr contains the error message. 

The bug occurs because the function is only checking the script part of the command, but not considering the presence of the error message in the stderr.

To fix this bug, we should update the function to check both the script part and the error message part of the command. We can use the 'in' keyword to check if 'stash' is present in the script and if 'usage:' is present in the stderr.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
