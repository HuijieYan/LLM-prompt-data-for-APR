The bug occurs in the function `match` due to the use of `command.script.split()[1]`. This expression attempts to access the second element of the split command script, which may not exist when the script contains only one word ("git" in this case).

To fix this bug, the code needs to be modified to check if the input command contains the word "stash" and if the "usage:" string is present in the stderr. If the command contains the word "stash" and the "usage:" string is present in stderr, then the function should return True, otherwise, it should return False.

Here is the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
from thefuck.utils import for_app

@for_app('git')
def match(command):
    return 'stash' in command.script and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

This code uses the `for_app` decorator to specify that the rule only applies to the "git" app. The updated `match` function checks if the command contains the word "stash" and if the "usage:" string is present in the stderr, and returns True if both conditions are met.
