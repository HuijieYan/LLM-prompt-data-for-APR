The error message `IndexError: list index out of range` is occurring at the line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` in the `match` function. This indicates that the `command.script` is being split into a list, and the code is trying to access the second element, which does not exist. 

The buggy function is trying to match the second word in the `command.script` with 'stash'. However, if the script doesn't contain more than one word, then an IndexError will occur.

To fix the bug, we can check if the length of the split command script is greater than 1 before accessing the second element of the list.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
