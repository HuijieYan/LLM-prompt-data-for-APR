The potential error in the function is the use of the `@git_support` decorator, which is not defined in the provided code.

Since there is no information about what the `@git_support` decorator does, I will assume it is supposed to handle errors related to Git commands.

To fix the bug, I will remove the `@git_support` decorator and handle the Git-related errors within the `match` function itself.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def match(command):
    try:
        return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    except IndexError:
        return False
```

In the corrected code, I added a try-except block to handle the possibility of an IndexError if the `split()` method does not find the second element in the command.script. If an IndexError occurs, the function will return False.
