The error occurs due to the attempt to access the second element of the split command.script, which results in an IndexError when the script is just 'git' without any additional arguments. The buggy function is trying to check if the second element of the split script is 'stash', but in the case of just 'git', this causes an IndexError.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the length of the split script is less than 2. We can also check if the first element of the split script is 'git' to ensure that we are dealing with a git command.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) >= 2 and split_script[0] == 'git':
        return (split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
```

This corrected function first checks if the length of the split script is greater than or equal to 2 and if the first element is 'git'. Only then it proceeds to check if the second element is 'stash' and 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. Otherwise, it returns False. This will prevent the IndexError and handle the case when the script is just 'git'.
