Potential Error Location:
The potential error is in the "match" function, where it checks if the command's script contains "stash" as the second word and if the stderr contains "usage:". 

Reason for the Bug:
The bug might occur because the function is not handling cases where the command doesn't have a second word or where the stderr does not contain "usage:". It is also not handling cases where the command's script might have additional parameters after "stash".

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the command's script has at least two words before accessing the second word.
2. Use a more robust condition to check if the stderr contains "usage:".

Corrected Code:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    return (len(words) > 1 and words[1] == 'stash'
            and any('usage:' in line for line in command.stderr.splitlines()))
```
