The given function `match` is a part of the `git_fix_stash` module and has a decorator `@git_support`. It checks if the second word in the input command is 'stash' and if the error message contains the word 'usage:'. If both conditions are true, then it returns True.

There is an issue in the comparison statement within the function. The problem is that the function does not check whether the input command has at least two words before trying to access the second word with `command.script.split()[1]`. This can result in an 'index out of range' error if the command does not have at least two words.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if the input command has at least two words before checking the second word. If not, we can return False.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    if len(words) >= 2:
        return (words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```
