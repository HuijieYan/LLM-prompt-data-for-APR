The buggy function is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr`. However, the problem lies in the fact that `command.script` is split into a list of words, and the comparison is being done with index 1 of this list. This comparison would fail in cases where the command has parameters after 'git', such as 'git push' or 'git pull'.

To fix this bug, we need to split the `command.script` and check if the first word is 'git' and the second word is 'stash'. Additionally, we need to check if 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[0] == 'git' and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
