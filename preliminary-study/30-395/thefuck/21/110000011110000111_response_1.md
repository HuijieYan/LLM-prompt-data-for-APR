The test case is calling the `match` function with a `Command` object which represents a git command with an error message. The error message from the test function indicates that the bug is occurring in the `match` function at line 32 of `thefuck/specific/git.py`.

The bug is occurring because of the following line in the `match` function:
```python
return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
The bug occurs because the `command.script.split()` call assumes that there will always be at least one element in the split result, which is not the case when the `command.script` is just 'git'.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the split result has at least two elements before accessing the second element to compare with 'stash'. If there are not at least two elements, then the match should fail.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

In the corrected code, we first split the `command.script` and store the result in `script_parts`. Then, we check if the length of `script_parts` is greater than 1 before attempting to access the second element to compare with 'stash'. If the length is not greater than 1, then the match fails and returns False.
