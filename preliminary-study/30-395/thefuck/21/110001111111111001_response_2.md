The error occurs in the line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` because `command.script` is just 'git' and when it's split, there's only one element in the list. Therefore, accessing index 1 causes an IndexError.

To fix this bug, we should add a check for the length of `command.script.split()`. If it's less than 2, then the function should return False.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) < 2:
        return False
    return (split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
