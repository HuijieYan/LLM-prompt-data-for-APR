The error occurs when the `split()` function is applied to the `command.script` attribute, which is 'git'. When trying to access the second element of the resulting list using `split()[1]`, it causes an IndexError because there is no second element in the list.

To fix this bug, we can first check the length of the split list before trying to access the second element. We also need to ensure that 'stash' is in the script and 'usage:' is in the stderr.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) > 1:
        if script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr:
            return True
    return False
```

This code first splits the script into parts and then checks if the second part is 'stash' and 'usage:' is in the stderr. If both conditions are met, it returns True, otherwise, it returns False.
