The error message "IndexError: list index out of range" indicates that the buggy function is trying to access an index in a list that does not exist. This occurs in the line `command.script.split()[1]`, where the buggy function is splitting the `command.script` and then trying to access the second element of the resulting list.

The bug occurs because the `command.script` does not contain any whitespace and therefore, splitting it results in a list with only one element. As a result, accessing index 1 in this list causes the IndexError.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to ensure that the split list has at least 2 elements before trying to access index 1.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
# corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the buggy function will first split the `command.script` and then check if the split list has at least 2 elements before accessing index 1. This prevents the IndexError and makes the function work correctly.
