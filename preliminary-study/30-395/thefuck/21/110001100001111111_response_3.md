The problem with the given `match` function is that it assumes the `command.script` will always contain at least two elements when split by whitespace, and it checks if the second element is `'stash'`. However, when the `command.script` is just `'git'`, this assumption fails and results in a `IndexError: list index out of range`.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `match` function to first check if the length of `command.script.split()` is at least 2 before checking the second element.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_split = command.script.split()
    if len(script_split) >= 2:
        return (script_split[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```

With this correction, the function checks the length of `script_split` before attempting to access the second element. If the length is less than 2, it returns `False` immediately, avoiding the `IndexError` that was occurring before.
