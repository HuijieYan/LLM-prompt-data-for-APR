Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the comparison of the command.script value with 'stash' and the presence of 'usage:' in the command.stderr.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug is likely occurring because the comparison is not checking for an exact match of 'stash' in the command.script value and 'usage:' in the command.stderr. Additionally, the comparison may not be handling cases where the 'stash' word is not in the exact position as expected.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Use a more robust method to split the command.script and check for the 'stash' keyword.
2. Use regex for a more flexible and accurate check for 'usage:' in the command.stderr.

```python
# Corrected function
def git_support(func):
    def wrapper(command):
        return (func(command) 
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return wrapper

@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return ('stash' in script_parts
            and len(script_parts) > 1
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash')
```
