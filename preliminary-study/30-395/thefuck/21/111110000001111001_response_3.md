The potential error in the buggy function is that it is trying to access an index of the `command.script.split()` without first checking if the string can be split. This can result in an IndexError if the split operation does not return a list with at least 2 elements.

The reason behind the bug is that the function is assuming the `command.script` can be split into multiple parts, but it does not account for the possibility that it cannot.

One approach for fixing the bug is to first check if the split operation will return a list with at least 2 elements before trying to access the second element.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected function
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) > 1:
        return (script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
```
