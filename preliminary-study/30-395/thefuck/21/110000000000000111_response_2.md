Potential error location: The line "return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)" is likely causing the bug.

Reasons behind the bug: The error message indicates that the bug occurs due to a "list index out of range" error, meaning that the split() function on command.script does not return a list with at least two elements. This error could occur if the command.script does not contain any whitespace-separated words.

Approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Check if command.script contains at least two elements before attempting to access the second element.
2. Verify if the command is a valid git command before performing any comparisons.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# corrected function
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    
    if len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr and 'git' in command.script:
        return True
    return False
```
