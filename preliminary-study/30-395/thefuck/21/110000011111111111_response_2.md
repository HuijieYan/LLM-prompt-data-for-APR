The error message "IndexError: list index out of range" in the test function indicates that the buggy function is trying to access an index in a list that does not exist. This occurs on line 8 of the provided function, specifically with the code `command.script.split()[1]`, which tries to access the second element of the list returned by the split function.

The reason for the bug is that the split function is being called on `command.script`, which in some cases may not have a space-separated second element. In the given test case, `command.script` is simply 'git', and splitting this string would result in a list with only one element.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the split function is called on a string that contains at least two space-separated elements. We can do this by first checking if there are enough elements in the split list.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In this corrected function, we split `command.script` and store the result in `script_parts`. Then, we check if the length of `script_parts` is greater than 1 to ensure there is at least a second element before accessing it. This prevents the IndexError that was occurring in the original code.
