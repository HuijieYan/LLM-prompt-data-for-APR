The error message indicates an IndexError: pop index out of range, which means that the code is trying to remove an element from a list using the pop method at an index that is out of the range of the list.

The potential error location within the function is the following lines:
```python
if upstream_option_index is not -1:
    command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
```
The bug is caused by the code trying to pop the same index twice, causing an index out of range error. Additionally, the logic for removing the '-u' option is incorrect, as it should only remove the argument following '-u' rather than the '-u' option itself.

To fix the bug, we need to first correct the logic for removing the '-u' option and its argument, and then ensure that we only pop the element at the specified index once.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # pop the argument following -u
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This code sets the upstream_option_index based on whether '--set-upstream' or '-u' is present, and then removes the option and its argument if '-u' is encountered. Then it retrieves the push upstream value from the command stderr and uses it to replace the argument in the command script_parts.
