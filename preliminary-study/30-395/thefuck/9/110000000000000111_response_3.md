The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the handling of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option for the git push command. The intention of the function is to remove these options from the input command and then construct a new command with the 'push' action and the next argument suggested by git. However, the bug occurs because the function does not handle the removal of '--set-upstream' and '-u' properly, and it also incorrectly constructs the new command by using the last part of the error message instead of the next argument suggested by git.

To fix the bug, the function should accurately remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options from the input command, and then obtain the next argument suggested by git for the 'push' action. This next argument should replace the old argument after 'push' to construct the new command.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return 'git push ' + push_upstream
```

In the corrected function, we properly handle the removal of the '--set-upstream' and '-u' options, and then construct the new command by directly using the 'push' action and the next argument suggested by git.
