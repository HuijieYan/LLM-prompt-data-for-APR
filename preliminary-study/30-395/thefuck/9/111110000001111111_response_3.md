The buggy function `get_new_command` is meant to modify and return a corrected git command that removes the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument, and replaces the 'push' command with its argument obtained from the stderr of the `command`. However, it is currently not working as intended.

The issue with the current function is that it tries to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list, but it does not handle the case where `-u` is found and removed but `--set-upstream` is also present.

Additionally, the way it derives the `push_upstream` variable is not accurate and is leading to incorrect outputs.

To fix the function, we need to:
1. Check both `--set-upstream` and `-u` independently and handle the removal of their argument correctly.
2. Extract the correct value for `push_upstream` by using a more precise method.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    command_parts = command.script_parts.copy()  # Create a copy of the list to avoid modifying the original
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the --set-upstream option
        command_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove its argument
    if '-u' in command_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command_parts.index('-u')
        command_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the -u option
        command_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove its argument

    # Extract the correct value for push_upstream
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip()[4:]  # Extract the correct value from the error message

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected function first creates a copy of the `command.script_parts` list to avoid modifying the original list. Then it checks for the presence of both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options and removes them along with their arguments if found. Finally, it extracts the correct value for `push_upstream` from the error message.
