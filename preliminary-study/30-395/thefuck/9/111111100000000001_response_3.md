Potential error location: The error may be at the lines where the `upstream_option_index` is being assigned values, and at the line where the `push_upstream` variable is being assigned a value.

Reasons for the bug:
1. The `upstream_option_index` is being assigned a value of `-1` initially, which might not be overwritten if the `try except` blocks are not executed.
2. The `push_upstream` variable is being extracted from `command.stderr`, and if the output does not match the expected format, it could cause issues.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use separate `try except` blocks for `--set-upstream` and `-u` to handle both cases independently.
2. Add error handling to ensure that the `command.stderr` contains the expected output and handle cases where it does not.

Corrected code:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    if push_upstream.startswith("push"):
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream.split()[-1])
    else:
        return " ".join(command.script_parts)
```
