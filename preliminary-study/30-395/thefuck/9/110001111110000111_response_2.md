The bug seems to be in the `get_new_command` function. The function is trying to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command, but it is not handling the case when the option is not present properly. This can lead to an `IndexError` when the code tries to remove the option and its argument if they are not present in the `command.script_parts` list.

The reason for the bug is that the function does not check if `upstream_option_index` is -1 after the `try-except` blocks. If the option is not found, `upstream_option_index` will remain as -1, and the subsequent code will try to remove elements from `command.script_parts` at index -1, leading to an `IndexError`.

To fix the bug, a conditional check is needed to ensure that `upstream_option_index` is not -1 before attempting to remove elements from `command.script_parts`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:  # Check if option is found
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The fix involves adding a check if `upstream_option_index` is not equal to -1 before attempting to remove elements from `command.script_parts`.

After implementing this fix, the function should handle cases where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is not present without causing an `IndexError`.
