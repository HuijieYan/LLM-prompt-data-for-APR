The error occurs in the `get_new_command` function due to incorrect index handling when `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are present in the `command.script_parts` list. The code tries to remove these options and their arguments from the list, but it behaves unexpectedly when both options are present.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the code handles the removal of both options and their arguments correctly. We also need to ensure that it handles cases where these options are not present in the list.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index is not -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        if len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index:  # Check if there's an argument to remove
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The correction involves checking if there is an argument to remove after removing the option. This ensures that both the option and its argument are removed correctly.
