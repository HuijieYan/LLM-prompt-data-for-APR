The error location within the `get_new_command` function is identified in the section where `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` is called twice after the `upstream_option_index` is found using `command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')` or `command.script_parts.index('-u')`.

The bug occurs because the pop operation is carried out twice on the same index, causing an `IndexError` when the index is out of range. This is because the if condition for checking if `upstream_option_index` is not equal to -1 is redundant, as it's already guaranteed that the index is valid if it's found using `index()`.

To fix this bug, the redundant if condition should be removed, and the pop operation should be carried out only once after finding the index of '--set-upstream' or '-u'.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove the element at upstream_option_index
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove the element at upstream_option_index
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
