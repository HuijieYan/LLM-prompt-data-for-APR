Potential error location: The error could be in the way the function is trying to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options from the command script.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because if the first try block successfully finds the '--set-upstream' option, the second try block for the '-u' option will still execute, potentially causing an error when trying to remove the option that was already removed.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the '--set-upstream' option is found before attempting to check for the '-u' option.
2. Use a single try block with multiple except clauses to handle both cases.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
# corrected function
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove both the option and its argument
    except ValueError:
        pass  # ignore if the option is not found
    
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove both the option and its argument
    except ValueError:
        pass  # ignore if the option is not found

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
