Potential error location: 
The error is occurring in the part of the code where it tries to pop the `upstream_option_index` from the `command.script_parts` list. 

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug is occurring because the code is attempting to pop an element from the list without checking if it exists. If the index `upstream_option_index` is equal to -1, it means that the value was not found in the list, and popping an element at that index will result in an IndexError.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the index `upstream_option_index` is not equal to -1 before attempting to pop the element from the list. 
2. Use the `remove` method to remove the element from the list without encountering an IndexError.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected function
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
