The error occurs when the `get_new_command` function is called with the command 'git push -u'. The function attempts to remove the '-u' option and its argument from the command, but encounters an IndexError when trying to pop the items from `command.script_parts` list. This indicates that the index `upstream_option_index` does not exist in the list.

The reason for the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the case when '-u' option is not found in the command.

To fix the bug, we should handle the case when the '-u' option is not found in the command. We can use if statements to check if the index of '--set-upstream' or '-u' exists before trying to remove it.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    else:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1

        if upstream_option_index != -1:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected code checks for the existence of '--set-upstream' and '-u' options in the command and only tries to remove them if they exist. This should fix the IndexError issue.
