The error occurs at the line `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` inside the `get_new_command` function. The `IndexError` is raised because the if-else block for finding the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` options is incorrect.

The buggy function `get_new_command` is trying to find the index for `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the `command.script_parts`. However, it is missing the else condition for the second `try-except` block. As a result, if the first `try` block finds the index and removes it, the second `try` block will still run, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to pop the index. 

To fix this, the function should use `if-else` instead of two separate `try-except` blocks and should also consider handling the case when `-u` is found. Additionally, the `upstream_option_index` should be handled differently than just checking if it's not -1. 

Below is the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected code first checks if either `--set-upstream` or `-u` is present in the `command.script_parts` and then removes them and their arguments if found.
