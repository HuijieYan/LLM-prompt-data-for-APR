Potential error location: 
The error is likely occurring in the line `push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]`. This line is trying to extract the suggested git command from the error message, but it is not handling cases where the error message format differs. 

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug is occurring because the code assumes the error message format to be consistent, which is not always the case. When the error message format changes, the code fails to extract the correct git command.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Instead of relying on the position of the error message within the stderr, use a more robust method to extract the suggested git command.
2. Handle different error message formats by parsing the error message more intelligently.

Corrected code:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index is not -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    # Extract the suggested git command more robustly from the error message
    error_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    for line in reversed(error_lines):
        if line.startswith('git '):
            push_upstream = line.strip().partition('git ')[2]
            return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)

    # If the suggested git command could not be extracted, return the original command
    return command.script
```
