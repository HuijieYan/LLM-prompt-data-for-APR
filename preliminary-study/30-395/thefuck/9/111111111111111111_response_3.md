The error in the code occurs in the `get_new_command` function when trying to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option from the `command.script_parts` list. The error occurs because the same index is being popped twice, which leads to an `IndexError`.

The reason for the bug is that the `upstream_option_index` is being updated incorrectly. It should only be updated if the respective option is found, and then the removal of the option and its argument should be based on this index.

To fix this bug, the function needs to correctly handle the removal of the specified options and their arguments from the `command.script_parts` list.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove --set-upstream
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove its argument
    except ValueError:
        pass

    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove -u
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove its argument
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In the corrected code:
1. The try-except block is used to check for the presence of `--set-upstream` and `-u` options separately, and then remove them along with their respective arguments from the `command.script_parts` list.
2. The logic for handling the `upstream_option_index` has been amended to ensure that it is updated correctly when any of the options are found.

After implementing these changes, the function should now handle the different cases correctly and not raise an IndexError. Additionally, it should return the expected corrected command based on the provided input.
