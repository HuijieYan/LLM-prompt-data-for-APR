The error occurs at the line `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)`, specifically, the second occurrence of this line. The error message indicates an "IndexError: pop index out of range."

The bug occurs because when `-u` is passed as an argument, it is included in `command.script_parts` and the index `upstream_option_index` is set accordingly. However, when the line `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` is executed, it removes the element at index `upstream_option_index`, but it does not update the value of `upstream_option_index` if there are multiple `-u` arguments present. This leads to an out of range index error when trying to pop an element that has already been removed.

To fix the bug, we should separate the `try` blocks for `--set-upstream` and `-u` and update the index `upstream_option_index` accordingly. Additionally, we should ensure that we're not popping the same index twice.

Below is the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function now handles the `-u` argument correctly and avoids popping the same index twice, resolving the IndexError issue.
