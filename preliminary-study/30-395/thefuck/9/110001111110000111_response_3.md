The error occurs in the `get_new_command` function when it tries to remove the `-u` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list. Since the `-u` option is pushed to the `command.script_parts` list twice, the second pop operation raises an IndexError because the list becomes empty after the first pop operation.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case when both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options are present in the `command.script_parts` list. Additionally, the logic for removing the options and their arguments is incorrect and can be simplified.

To fix the bug, the following approach can be taken:
1. Instead of using two try-except blocks to identify the index of `--set-upstream` and `-u` options separately, both options should be handled in a single try-except block to check for their presence in `command.script_parts` and remove them if found.
2. After identifying the index of either `--set-upstream` or `-u` option, the function should remove both the option and its argument in a single pop operation.
3. If no such options are found in the `command.script_parts` list, the function should ignore the removal logic.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Check if --set-upstream or -u are passed and remove them along with their arguments
    upstream_options = ['--set-upstream', '-u']
    for option in upstream_options:
        try:
            option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            # Remove the option and its argument
            command.script_parts.pop(option_index)
            command.script_parts.pop(option_index)
            break  # Exit the loop if any option is found and removed
        except ValueError:
            pass

    # Extract the suggested branch from the stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected function handles the removal of both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options and their respective arguments in a single pop operation if found in the `command.script_parts` list. Additionally, it addresses the issue of the IndexError and provides the expected behavior for the `get_new_command` function.
