The error occurs because the `upstream_option_index` is being used to index `command.script_parts` multiple times based on the presence of "--set-upstream" or "-u", and it is being popped from `command.script_parts` twice in the case where these options are present. This leads to an `IndexError` when attempting to pop it a second time.

A possible approach to fix this bug is to only pop the `upstream_option_index` once, regardless of the number of occurrences of "--set-upstream" or "-u".

Here's the corrected code:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index is not -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
