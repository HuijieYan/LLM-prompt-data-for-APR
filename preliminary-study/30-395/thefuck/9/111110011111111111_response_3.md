The error occurs in the `get_new_command` function when it tries to remove an element from the `command.script_parts` list. The issue arises because the code attempts to remove the element twice if the `-u` flag is present.

The bug occurs because the original code pops the element at `upstream_option_index` twice when the `-u` flag is present. This leads to an `IndexError` when trying to pop an element that doesn't exist after the first `pop` operation.

To fix the bug, we should only pop the element once after checking both for `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By making these changes, we ensure that the element is only removed once from the list, correcting the bug and preventing the `IndexError`.
