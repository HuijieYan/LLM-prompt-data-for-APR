The buggy function is supposed to handle the `git push` command and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument from it. Then it retrieves the suggested git command from the error message and replaces the `push` command with this suggested command.

Looking at the buggy function, it seems that the issue lies in the logic to find and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument from the command. The current logic does not handle the case where `-u` is found, and it incorrectly removes the argument at the same index twice.

The error occurs because it's not handling the case where the argument is `-u`. Additionally, the logic for finding the suggested git command from the error message might be incorrect, as it always looks for the command in the second to last line of the error message.

To fix this bug, we need to:
1. Properly handle the case when the argument is `-u`.
2. Find the command suggested by git in a more reliable way, perhaps by parsing the error message more accurately.

Here's the corrected function:
```python
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(index)
        command.script_parts.pop(index)  # Remove the argument after -u

    # Find the suggested git command from the error message
    error_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    suggested_command = None
    for line in error_lines:
        if line.strip().startswith('git push'):
            suggested_command = line.strip().partition('git ')[2]
            break

    # Replace the 'push' command with the suggested command
    if suggested_command:
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', suggested_command)
    else:
        return " ".join(command.script_parts)
```
