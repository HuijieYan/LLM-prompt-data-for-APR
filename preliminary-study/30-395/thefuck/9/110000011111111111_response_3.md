The error occurs in the `get_new_command` function when the `pop` method is called on the `command.script_parts` list. The error message indicates that an IndexError is raised because the index used in the `pop` method is out of range.

The bug occurs because when the `upstream_option_index` is found, it is removed from the `command.script_parts` list. However, the subsequent call to `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` tries to access the same index that was already removed. This results in the IndexError.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that we only remove the index once. We should also take into account that the index of `-u` may not necessarily be `upstream_option_index`.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    upstream_short_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_short_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    elif upstream_short_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_short_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected code, we handle the cases where either `--set-upstream` or `-u` is present in the `command.script_parts` list, and ensure that the index is only removed once. This should fix the bug and allow the function to work as expected.
