Potential error location: The function is trying to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument from the command, but it is not doing so correctly.

Reasons behind the bug: The if condition for checking if the 'upstream_option_index' is not -1 is incorrect. Also, the function is trying to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument from the command, but it is not doing so correctly.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: 
1. Correct the if condition for checking if the 'upstream_option_index' is not -1.
2. Use the correct index to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument from the command.

Corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
