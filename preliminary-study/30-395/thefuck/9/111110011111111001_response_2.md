The error occurs in the buggy function `get_new_command` when `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` is called. The error message indicates an `IndexError: pop index out of range` which means the index provided to the pop function is out of range for the list.

The bug occurs because the pop function is called twice in the if block, which can lead to an index out of range situation depending on the value of `upstream_option_index`.

To fix the bug, we can remove one of the pop function calls and make sure to only pop once if `upstream_option_index` is not -1.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
