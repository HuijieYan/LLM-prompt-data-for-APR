The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `git push` command and then concatenate the remaining arguments onto the command suggested by git, which includes `--set-upstream` and its argument. However, the current implementation is incorrect and does not handle the logic as expected.

The bug occurs because the function incorrectly tries to find the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option in the `command.script_parts` list and then tries to remove it and its argument. However, after finding the index of `-u`, the function always removes the element at the index `upstream_option_index`, which results in the removal of only the `-u` option and not its argument, leading to an incorrect command.

To fix this bug, the function should first correctly find the index of the `-u` or `--set-upstream` option and then remove the option as well as its argument from the `command.script_parts` list. Additionally, it should concatenate the remaining arguments onto the suggested `git push` command, which includes the `--set-upstream` option and its argument.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Find the index of --set-upstream or -u option
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        # Remove the option and its argument
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument

    # Get the push upstream from the stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]

    # Replace the argument and return
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected code ensures that both the `-u` option and its argument are removed from the command script parts, and the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the suggested `git push` command correctly.
