Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is when trying to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options from the command.script_parts list. The error could occur in the logic used to remove these options, as well as in the use of the 'pop' method to remove elements from the list.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug occurs because the script is not properly handling the removal of '--set-upstream' or '-u' options from the command. Additionally, the logic used to retrieve the push upstream from the stderr is not handling the string split and partition operations properly.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use a loop to search for and remove both '--set-upstream' and '-u' options from the command.script_parts list.
2. Use proper error handling when attempting to retrieve the push upstream from the stderr, as the split and partition operations may not always work as expected.

Corrected Code:
```python
# this is the corrected function
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u if present
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')

    # Get the push upstream from stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
