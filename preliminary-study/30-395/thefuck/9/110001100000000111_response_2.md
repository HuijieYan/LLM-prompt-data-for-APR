Potential error location: 

The error is likely occurring in the `get_new_command` function, specifically in the section where it attempts to find and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the command script parts.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:

The bug occurs because the code does not handle the case when both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options are present in the command script parts. Additionally, the code is not properly removing the argument that follows the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

1. Use a single `try` block to search for both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options and handle the case when both are present.
2. After finding the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option, also remove the argument that follows it.
3. Handle the case when the `git push` command does not have the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options.

Corrected code:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
