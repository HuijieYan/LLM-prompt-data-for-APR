The error occurs in the buggy function due to the use of `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` twice in a row. This causes an `IndexError` when `upstream_option_index` is equal to -1, which happens when '--set-upstream' or '-u' is not found in `command.script_parts`.

The purpose of the function is to remove '--set-upstream' or '-u' and its argument from the command, and then replace 'push' with the retrieved `push_upstream`. However, the current implementation is flawed and does not handle all cases correctly.

To fix the bug, the function should check if `upstream_option_index` is not -1 before attempting to remove elements from `command.script_parts`. Additionally, the logic for finding the `push_upstream` needs to be revisited to ensure it returns the correct value in all cases.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):  # Check if there is an argument to remove
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With these changes, the function should handle all cases correctly and return the expected results for the given test cases.
