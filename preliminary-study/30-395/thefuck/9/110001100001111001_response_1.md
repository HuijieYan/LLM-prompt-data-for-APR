The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command and replace the `push` command with the actual command suggested by git. The script then joins the `command.script_parts` into a string and replaces the `push` command with the actual command suggested by git.

The bug occurs because the current implementation uses an incorrect way to check if `--set-upstream` or `-u` is in the `command.script_parts` and remove it. Additionally, the extraction of the upstream part from the error message is incorrect.

To fix the bug, the correct approach is to use the `in` operator to check the existence of `--set-upstream` or `-u` in `command.script_parts`. Then, the extraction of the upstream part from the error message also needs to be corrected. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        if option in command.script_parts:
            index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(index)
            command.script_parts.pop(index)
        
    error_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    push_upstream = error_lines[-3].split()[-3:]
    push_upstream = ' '.join(push_upstream)
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
