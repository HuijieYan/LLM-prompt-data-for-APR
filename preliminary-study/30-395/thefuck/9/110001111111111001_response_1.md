The bug is occurring in the `get_new_command` function, specifically in the following section of code:

```python
if upstream_option_index is not -1:
    command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
```

The bug is caused by attempting to pop the same index from `command.script_parts` twice in succession, which leads to an `IndexError` when the index is out of range. This is likely due to attempting to remove an index when it's not present in the list, resulting in the list becoming shorter.

To fix this bug, we need to revise the code to remove the correct index from `command.script_parts`. Additionally, we will incorporate the logic to modify the command by concatenating `push_upstream` with 'push'.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index > -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    command.script_parts = ['git', push_upstream]
    return " ".join(command.script_parts)
```

With these changes, the function should now perform as expected and not throw an `IndexError`.
