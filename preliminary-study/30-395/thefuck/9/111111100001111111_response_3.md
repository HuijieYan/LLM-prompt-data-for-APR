The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument and its parameter from the `command.script_parts` list, retrieve the suggestion from the last 3 lines of `command.stderr`, and replace the "push" argument with the retrieved suggestion.

The issue arises because the current implementation mistakenly tries to remove the `-u` argument based on an index found in the `command.script_parts`, and it incorrectly removes it twice, leading to an incorrect suggestion generation.

To fix the bug, we can update the code as follows:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    updated_script_parts = [part for part in command.script_parts if part != '--set-upstream' and part != '-u']

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(updated_script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this fix, we handle the removal of `--set-upstream` or `-u` using a list comprehension and then use the updated `script_parts` list to generate the new command with the correct suggestion.

This should resolve the issue and provide the correct command suggestion for the `git push` command.
