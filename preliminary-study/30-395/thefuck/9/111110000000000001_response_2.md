Potential error location:
The error is likely occurring in the try-except blocks where the script_parts index is being searched for '--set-upstream' and '-u'. The logic to remove these elements from the script_parts list might also be incorrect.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug may be occurring because if the first try block finds '--set-upstream', the second try block can still find '-u' and overwrite the value of upstream_option_index, causing incorrect removal of elements from the script_parts list.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we can use an if-else structure to check for both '--set-upstream' and '-u' and ensure that their corresponding elements are correctly removed from the script_parts list.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the fixed function
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
