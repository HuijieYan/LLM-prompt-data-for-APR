The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to handle the `git push` command and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the command. It then extracts the suggested new command from the error message and replaces the original `push` command with the suggested command.

However, there are a few issues in the function:
1. The code attempts to find the index of `--set-upstream` and `-u` options in the `command.script_parts`, but if the index is found for one option, it may be overwritten by the other option. The correct approach should be to use an `if-else` statement to separate the checks for both options.
2. In the new command extraction, the code uses `command.stderr.split('\n')[-3]` to extract the suggestion. This assumes that the relevant line is always the third to last line, which may not be true for different error messages.

To fix the issues, we can:
1. Separate the checks for `--set-upstream` and `-u` options and handle each case separately.
2. Use more robust parsing to extract the suggestion from the error message.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')

    error_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    for line in reversed(error_lines):
        if line.startswith('    git push --set-upstream'):
            push_upstream = line.strip().split('git push --set-upstream ')[1]
            return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)

    return None
```

This corrected code ensures that both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options are handled correctly, and the suggestion is extracted by searching for the specific line in the error message.
