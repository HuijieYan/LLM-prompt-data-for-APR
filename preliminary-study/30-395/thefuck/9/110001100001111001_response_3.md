The buggy function appears to be trying to handle the case where the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option is passed as part of the command. However, it mistakenly deletes the element at the index of '--set-upstream' or '-u' without considering the fact that the subsequent element will also be an argument associated with these options.

The bug is occurring because when `upstream_option_index` is found, the subsequent index is also being deleted instead of just removing the option and its argument.

To fix the bug, we need to delete both the option and its argument when it is found, and then construct the push command using the value obtained from `command.stderr`.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove the option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove its argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
