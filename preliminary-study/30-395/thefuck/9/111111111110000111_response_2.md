The error occurs at the line `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` where the `pop()` method is being called using the `upstream_option_index` as the index. The error message `IndexError: pop index out of range` indicates that the index is out of range, meaning it is either negative or larger than the length of the list.

The bug occurs because the code is trying to remove elements from the list `command.script_parts` based on the index `upstream_option_index`, which is not being correctly determined. This leads to the index being out of range and causing the `pop()` method to raise an `IndexError`.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly determine the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the command script and then remove the corresponding elements from the list `command.script_parts`.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # As the previous line removes an element from the list, we need to adjust the index
        # by subtracting 1 from it
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function will correctly determine the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the command script and remove the corresponding elements from the list `command.script_parts`. This should resolve the `IndexError` and make the function work as expected.
