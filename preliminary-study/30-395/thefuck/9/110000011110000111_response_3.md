The error message indicates an "IndexError" occurring at line 32 of the "get_new_command" function, specifically at the line where the "pop" method is called on "command.script_parts." This suggests that the index being used in the "pop" method is out of range.

The bug occurs because the code attempts to pop the same index twice without checking if the index still exists after the first pop operation. This leads to an "IndexError" when the index is out of range after the first "pop" operation.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the index exists before attempting to pop it. Additionally, we need to incorporate the logic for removing both "--set-upstream" and "-u" from the "command.script_parts" list.

```python
# Corrected function
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In this corrected function, we first try to remove the "--set-upstream" option from the "command.script_parts" list if it exists. Then, we try to remove the "-u" option from the list if it exists. These are done within separate "try-except" blocks to handle the cases where these options might not be present in the command. This approach ensures that we do not attempt to pop an index that is out of range, fixing the bug.
