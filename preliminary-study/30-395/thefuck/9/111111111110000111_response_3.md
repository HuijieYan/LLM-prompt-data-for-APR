The error message indicates an "IndexError" at line 27 of the file "git_push.py", which most likely occurs when trying to pop elements from the "command.script_parts" list.

The bug occurs because when the "-u" option is passed in the command, both the "try" blocks for finding "--set-upstream" and "-u" are executed, and the index of "-u" is stored in "upstream_option_index" last. As a result, the index of "--set-upstream" is overwritten by the index of "-u", leading to the incorrect removal of elements from the "command.script_parts" list.

To fix the bug, both "try" blocks for "--set-upstream" and "-u" should be combined so that the index of "--set-upstream" and "-u" are obtained separately. After obtaining both indices, the element at the respective index should be removed from the "command.script_parts" list.

Here's the corrected code for the "get_new_command" function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        u_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        u_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    elif u_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(u_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(u_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
This corrected code should fix the bug by correctly handling the indices of "--set-upstream" and "-u" and removing the corresponding elements from the "command.script_parts" list.
