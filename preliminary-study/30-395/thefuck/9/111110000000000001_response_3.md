Potential Error Location: The error is likely occurring in the try-except blocks where the upstream_option_index is being assigned based on the index of '--set-upstream' and '-u' in the command.script_parts list. 

Reasons Behind the Bug: 
1. If the try block for '--set-upstream' is successful, the value of upstream_option_index will be overwritten by the try block for '-u', which is not the intended behavior. 
2. The pop function is used to remove both the option and its argument from command.script_parts, but this will not work correctly if the option and its argument are not consecutive elements in the list.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use separate if statements for '--set-upstream' and '-u' instead of using try-except.
2. After removing the option and its argument from command.script_parts, check if the following element needs to be removed as well.

Corrected Code:

```python
# Fixed function
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove the option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove the argument
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove the option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove the argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
