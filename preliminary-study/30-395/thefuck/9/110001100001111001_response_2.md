The bug in the provided code is that the function does not correctly handle the case where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is included in the `git push` command. The code attempts to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list, but it does so incorrectly. Additionally, the code assumes that the `command.stderr.split('\n')[-3]` line will always return the expected push upstream, which may not always be the case.

To fix the bug, the function should handle the removal of `--set-upstream` or `-u` correctly and should not rely solely on the position of elements in the `command.script_parts` list. Instead, it should explicitly check for the presence of these options and handle them accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if "--set-upstream" in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove("--set-upstream")
    elif "-u" in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove("-u")

    for index, part in enumerate(command.script_parts):
        if part in {"--set-upstream", "-u"}:
            command.script_parts.pop(index)  # Remove the option
            if index < len(command.script_parts):
                command.script_parts.pop(index)  # Also remove the argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected code explicitly checks for the existence of `--set-upstream` or `-u` in `command.script_parts` and removes them if found, handling both the option and its accompanying argument correctly. It also assumes that the `stderr` output always contains the expected push upstream, which may need to be handled if it's not always the case.
