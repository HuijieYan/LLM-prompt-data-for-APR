The issue with the function is that when trying to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options from the command script parts, it uses the same index for both options. This means that if the '-u' option is found, it will overwrite the index previously found for the '--set-upstream' option.

The correction should be to use an 'if' and 'elif' statement instead of two 'try' blocks to ensure that if '--set-upstream' is found, it can't be overridden by '-u'.

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
