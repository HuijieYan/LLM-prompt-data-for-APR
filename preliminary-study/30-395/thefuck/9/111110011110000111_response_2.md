The error message indicates that there is an `IndexError` occurring in the `get_new_command` function at line 32 when trying to execute the line `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)`. This is likely due to the fact that in some cases, the `upstream_option_index` is not being properly identified, leading to an index out of range error when trying to pop the element from `command.script_parts`.

The bug occurs because the code is not properly handling cases where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are not present in the `command.script_parts`. This causes the `upstream_option_index` to be set to -1, and then the code tries to pop an element at index -1, which raises an `IndexError`.

To fix this bug, we can add a condition to check if `upstream_option_index` is not -1 before trying to pop the elements from `command.script_parts`.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:  # Check if not -1
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):  # Check if index is within bounds
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
