The potential error in the provided function is in the use of `command.script_parts.index` to find the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u`. The code does not handle the case where both options are present in the command.

The bug occurs because the code does not consider the case where both `--set-upstream` and `-u` are present in the command. As a result, the code might only remove one of them, leading to an incorrect result.

To fix the bug, you can modify the code to use an if-else condition to check for both options separately and then remove them from the `command.script_parts` list.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove them and their arguments. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove --set-upstream
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove its argument
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove -u
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove its argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
