The potential error in the provided code is with the logic to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' and its argument from the command script_parts. The code is using the 'pop' method to remove these elements, but it is not accounting for the fact that after removing the element at index 'upstream_option_index', the index of the next element changes. This results in incorrect removal of elements from the list.

The bug occurred because the code did not handle the index adjustment after removing an element from the list, leading to the removal of incorrect elements from the list.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for removing '--set-upstream' or '-u' and its argument from the command script_parts. Instead of using 'pop' directly, we should use the 'remove' method to remove the elements based on their values.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
