The error message indicates an IndexError occurring in the get_new_command function at line 32, which is a result of popping an element from an empty list. This means that the index 'upstream_option_index' is not found in the 'command.script_parts' list, leading to no element to be popped.

The bug occurs because the code doesn't handle the case where the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option is not present in the command. As a result, it assumes that the option is always present and tries to remove it from the list, causing an IndexError.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if the option index is not equal to -1 before attempting to remove the element from the list.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this fix, the code first checks if the index is found before trying to remove it from the list, preventing the IndexError from occurring.
