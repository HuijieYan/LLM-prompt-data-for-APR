The error message indicates that the test case is expecting a ValueError to be raised, but the function is not raising it. This means that the function is not handling the casting of NaT (Not a Time) values to integers correctly.

The issue is likely happening in the part of the function where it checks for the conversion of NaT values to integers. The function should properly handle the conversion of NaT values according to the dtype provided.

To fix the bug, the function `astype_nansafe` should handle the conversion of NaT values to integers by specifically checking for NaT and raising a ValueError if an attempt is made to convert it to an incompatible dtype.

The corrected function is shown below:

```python
import numpy as np

def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
        Cannot convert NaT values to incompatible dtypes.

    """

    if np.isnat(arr).any() and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged.

```

In this corrected version, we explicitly check for NaT values and incompatible dtypes, and raise a ValueError as required.
