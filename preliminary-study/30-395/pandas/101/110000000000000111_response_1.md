The error occurs when trying to cast a Categorical or CategoricalIndex containing NaNs to an integer dtype. The bug is related to the incorrect conversion of NaN to an integer value.

The potential error location within the function is in the block that handles the conversion of categorical dtype to integer.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle the special case of converting NaN from categorical to integer dtype correctly. When casting a Categorical containing NaNs to an integer dtype, it should treat the NaNs as missing values, not convert them to an incorrect integer representation.

To fix the bug, we need to add a specific check for NaN values when casting from categorical dtype to integer.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
import numpy as np

def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy=True, skipna=False):
    if arr.dtype.name == 'category' and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        result = arr.cat.codes
        result[arr.isna()] = np.nan
        return result.astype(dtype)

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...

    return arr.view(dtype)
```

In this corrected version, we have added a specific check to handle the case when converting a Categorical dtype to an integer dtype. We first extract the codes from the categorical data, then replace the NaN values with np.nan (missing value representation), and finally, we cast the result to the desired integer dtype.
