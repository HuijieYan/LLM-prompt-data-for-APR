The error message indicates that the test case is failing because the `astype_nansafe` function is not raising a `ValueError` as expected. This is likely due to the function not handling NaN values properly. 

The issue seems to be related to converting categorical data containing NaN values to integer values. The bug causes NaNs to be converted to incorrect integer negative values, which is unexpected behavior. Therefore, the function `astype_nansafe` needs to be updated to handle this specific case.

The potential error location within the buggy function is likely the part where it handles categorical data and NaN values. The issue occurs because the function does not properly handle the conversion of NaN values from categorical to integer dtype.

To fix the bug, the `astype_nansafe` function needs to be modified to handle categorical data and NaN values properly. This can be achieved by adding explicit checks for NaN values and ensuring that they are handled correctly when converting to integer dtype. Additionally, edge cases related to categorical dtype conversion should be thoroughly tested to ensure proper handling of NaN values.

Below is the corrected code for the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # -- Updated code to handle categorical data and NaN values --
    if is_categorical_dtype(arr):
        # Handle categorical data conversion
        if pd.isna(arr).any():
            return pd.array(arr, copy=copy, dtype=dtype)
        else:
            return arr.astype(dtype)

    # -- Rest of the function remains unchanged --

```

In the corrected code, we specifically handle the case when the input array `arr` is of categorical type and contains NaN values. We use the `pd.array` function to handle this conversion in a nan-safe manner. This modification ensures that NaN values in categorical data are handled correctly when converting to the specified dtype.
