The error occurs because the `astype_nansafe` function is not properly handling the special case where the input array contains a NaT (Not a Time) value and needs to be cast to an integer type. This error arises from the conditional checks in the function that do not cover this specific scenario.

To fix this, we need to modify the `astype_nansafe` function to properly handle the conversion of NaT values to integer types. This can be achieved by adding a conditional check for NaT values and raising a ValueError with an appropriate message.

Here's the corrected `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy=True, skipna=False):
    if pd.isna(arr).any():
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")
    else:
        return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)
```

This correction adds a check for NaT values using the `pd.isna` function. If any NaT values are found in the input array, a ValueError is raised. Otherwise, the array is converted to the specified dtype using the `astype` method.

With this correction, the `astype_nansafe` function should now properly handle the conversion of arrays containing NaT values to integer types, as indicated in the test cases.
