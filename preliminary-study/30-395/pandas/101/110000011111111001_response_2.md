The error message indicates that the function `astype_nansafe` did not raise a `ValueError` as expected. This suggests that the function is not handling the conversion of NaT (Not a Time) values to integers properly.

Upon analyzing the code, it seems that the issue may be related to the check for NaT values and their conversion to integers. The function should handle the special case of NaT values when converting to integer dtype.

The bug occurs because the function does not check for NaT values and handle them appropriately when performing the conversion. As a result, the function does not raise the expected `ValueError` when encountering NaT values.

To fix the bug, the function needs to explicitly check for NaT values and raise a `ValueError` when attempting to convert them to integer dtype.

Here's the corrected code for the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy=True, skipna=False):
    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)

    if (np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.datetime64) and arr.item() == 'NaT') or (np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.timedelta64) and arr.item() == 'NaT'):
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # ... (remaining code remains unchanged)
```

In this corrected code, we explicitly check if the input array contains NaT values and raise a `ValueError` if it does, as this operation is not supported for integer dtype. This fix ensures that the function properly handles the conversion of NaT values to integer dtype and raises the appropriate error when needed.
