The error message indicates that the `astype_nansafe` function does not raise the expected `ValueError` when converting `NaT` values to an integer.

The potential error in the `astype_nansafe` function is in the section that handles the case when converting `NaT` values to an integer. It appears that the function does not properly handle this scenario, which results in the test failure.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the conversion of `NaT` values to integer types.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to add a specific condition to handle the conversion of `NaT` values to integers and raise a `ValueError` with an appropriate message. Additionally, it may be necessary to review the logic for handling `NaT` values across the function and ensure that it aligns with the expectations for the data type conversions.

Below is the corrected code for the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool=True, skipna: bool=False):
    if np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer) and np.isnat(arr):
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # ... rest of the function's code ...
```
