The error seems to occur when converting a categorical series back into an integer column, where NaN values are being converted to an unexpected negative value instead of NaN.

The potential error location within the function is likely in the section that handles the conversion of categorical data to integer data.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely due to the mishandling of NaN values during the conversion process, leading to unexpected results.

To fix the bug, the function should handle NaN values appropriately during the conversion from categorical to integer data, ensuring that NaN values are converted to NaN in the integer type.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import pandas as pd

def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # handle categorical to int conversion
    if arr.dtype.name == 'category' and dtype == np.int64:
        if copy:
            arr = arr.copy()
        arr[arr.isna()] = pd.NA  # convert NaN values to Pandas NA
        arr = arr.astype(dtype)
        return arr

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)
```

In the corrected code, we specifically handle the case where the input array is of type 'category' and the desired dtype is 'int64'. We first make a copy of the array if necessary, then convert all NaN values to `pd.NA` before performing the dtype conversion to int64. This ensures that NaN values are properly handled during the categorical to integer conversion.
