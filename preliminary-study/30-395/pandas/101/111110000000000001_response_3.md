Potential error location:
The error is likely to be occurring in the final section of the function, where it is trying to return the array after casting to the new dtype. There are multiple conditional statements and checks throughout the function which might also be leading to errors.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug may be occurring due to the conditional checks not handling all possible combinations of input array dtype and the target dtype properly. Additionally, there might be issues with the handling of NaN values and dtype conversion.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that all possible combinations of input array dtype and target dtype are handled properly.
2. Add explicit handling for NaN values for the specified dtype conversions.
3. Simplify the code by reducing the number of conditional statements and checks.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import numpy as np

def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy=True, skipna=False):
    if isinstance(dtype, str):
        dtype = np.dtype(dtype)

    if is_datetime64_dtype(arr) and is_datetime64_dtype(dtype):
        return arr.astype(dtype)

    if is_timedelta64_dtype(arr) and is_timedelta64_dtype(dtype):
        return arr.astype(dtype)

    return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)
```

In the corrected code, the function handles the conversion of dtype directly without complex conditional checks. It also explicitly handles datetime and timedelta dtype conversions, while simplifying the overall logic.
