The error occurs when trying to convert a categorical series back into an integer column. The problem arises when NaN values in the categorical series are converted to an incorrect integer negative value, instead of being converted to NaN in the integer type.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the code block that handles converting categorical data to integer data.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function does not handle NaN values in categorical series correctly when converting them to integer type.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle NaN values in the categorical series appropriately by converting them to NaN in the integer type.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy=True, skipna=False):
    # ... (other code remains the same)

    if is_categorical(arr):
        if dtype == np.int64:
            return arr.astype("Int64")

    # ... (other code remains the same)
```

In the corrected code, we've added a check to handle the case where the input array is categorical. If the target dtype is np.int64, we convert the categorical array to "Int64" type, which correctly handles the NaN values. This modification addresses the issue of converting categorical NaNs to an incorrect integer value.
