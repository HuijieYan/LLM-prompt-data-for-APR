The error is occurring when trying to cast a Categorical or CategoricalIndex containing NaNs to an integer dtype. The issue seems to be related to the incorrect conversion of NaNs in categorical columns to integer negative values.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the section of code that handles the conversion from categorical to integer dtype.

The bug is occurring because when converting the categorical series back into an integer column, it wrongly converts NaN to an incorrect integer negative value.

To fix the bug, one approach could be to modify the code that handles the conversion of categorical columns to integer dtype, ensuring that NaN is handled correctly and results in NaN in IntX (nullable integer) or float.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    if dtype.name == "Int64" and is_categorical_dtype(arr.dtype):
        return arr.astype(dtype)

    # ... rest of the code ...
```

This change specifically checks if the target dtype is "Int64" and the input dtype is a categorical type. If both conditions are met, it directly returns the input array with the specified "Int64" dtype, avoiding any incorrect conversion of NaN values.
