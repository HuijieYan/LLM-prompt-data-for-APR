The provided code seems to have an issue with converting NaT (Not a Time) values to integer. The test case is designed to check if the function raises a ValueError when trying to convert NaT values to integer.

Upon examination, it seems that the bug is related to the handling of NaT values when converting them to integer data type.

The issue is occurring because the function is not handling NaT values properly when trying to convert them to integer. This results in the test case not raising the expected ValueError.

To fix the bug, the function should include a specific check for NaT values and raise a ValueError when trying to convert them to integer.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from numpy import ndarray
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_datetime64_dtype, is_timedelta64_dtype, is_object_dtype
from pandas.core.dtypes.dtypes import pandas_dtype


def astype_nansafe(arr: ndarray, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    if np.isnat(arr):
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # rest of the function code
    # ...

    return arr.view(dtype)
```

In the corrected code, we have added a check for NaT values using `np.isnat` and raise a ValueError if NaT values are encountered. This ensures that the function handles NaT values properly when converting them to integer data type.
