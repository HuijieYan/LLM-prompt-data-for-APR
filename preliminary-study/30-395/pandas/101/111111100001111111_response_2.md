Potential error location:
The bug seems to be related to the conversion of NaN values in a categorical series to an incorrect integer value when converting to an integer dtype.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The issue occurs because when converting a categorical series that contains NaN values to an integer dtype, the NaN values are being incorrectly converted to a large negative integer value instead of remaining as NaN.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
One approach to fix this bug would be to modify the code to handle the conversion of NaN values in a categorical series to the appropriate integer or float representation, rather than converting them to incorrect negative integer values.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    if str(arr.dtype).startswith('category') and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        return arr.astype('Int' + str(dtype.itemsize * 8))
    else:
        # remaining code as is
        pass
```

I have added a condition to specifically handle the case where the input array has a 'category' dtype and the desired conversion type is an integer dtype. In this case, we use the `astype` method to convert the array to 'IntX' type based on the item size of the desired dtype. This should address the issue of incorrect conversion of NaN values in the categorical series to large negative integer values.
