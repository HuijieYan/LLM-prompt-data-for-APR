The error message indicates that the `astype_nansafe` function is not properly handling the conversion of NaT (Not a Time) values to integer. This is likely due to discrepancies in how NaT values are handled within the function.

The potential error location within the function is the section that deals with `numpy.datetime64` and `numpy.timedelta64` types.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle the conversion of NaT values to integer properly, leading to the error in the test cases.

To fix the bug, the function should include a specific condition to check for NaT values and handle the conversion to the specified data type accordingly.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    if dtype == np.int64 and pd.isna(arr).any():
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")
    else:
        return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)
```
