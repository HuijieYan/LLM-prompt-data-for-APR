The potential error location within the code is in the section where the function tries to convert non-finite values (NA or inf) to an integer. The code checks if the input array contains non-finite values and then tries to convert them to an integer, raising a ValueError if non-finite values are found.

The bug occurs because the code is not handling non-finite values correctly, and it is trying to convert them to an integer without first checking for their presence.

To fix the bug, the code should first check if the input array contains non-finite values and handle them appropriately. One approach to fix the bug is to modify the section of code where non-finite values are being converted to an integer. Instead of raising a ValueError, the code should handle non-finite values by converting them to a suitable type or replacing them with a specific value (e.g., replacing non-finite values with NaN).

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import to_datetime, to_timedelta

def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    if np.isnan(arr).any():
        if np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
            return arr.astype(dtype).astype(np.float64)
        elif np.issubdtype(dtype, np.floating):
            return arr.astype(dtype)
    
    # ... (rest of the code remains the same)
```

In the corrected code, the `if np.isnan(arr).any():` condition is added to check if the input array `arr` contains NaN values, and appropriate handling of NaN values is performed based on the data type `dtype`. If `dtype` is an integer type, non-finite values are converted to a suitable type, and if `dtype` is a floating-point type, the array is simply cast to `dtype`. The rest of the code remains the same.
