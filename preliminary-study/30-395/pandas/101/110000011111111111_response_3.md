## Analysis
The test case is intended to check if the `astype_nansafe` function raises a `ValueError` when attempting to cast a `NaN` value to an integer. The error message indicates that the test failed to raise a `ValueError`, which suggests that the `astype_nansafe` function is not behaving as expected.

## Potential Error Location
The potential error location within the `astype_nansafe` function is around the handling of `NaN` values when casting to integer types.

## Reasons for the Bug
The bug may be caused by incorrect handling of `NaN` values when casting to integer types. The function may not be properly detecting and converting `NaN` values during the casting process.

## Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug
1. Update the function to handle `NaN` values specifically for integer types, ensuring that they are converted to appropriate representations (e.g., `None` or `NaN`).
2. Check the condition where the function is attempting to cast `NaN` values to integer types and modify the logic to handle these cases correctly.
3. Add specific checks for `NaN` values before casting to integer types and raise a `ValueError` if necessary.

## Corrected Code

```python
import numpy as np

def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    if np.isnan(arr).any() and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaN values to integer")
    
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ... (existing function code)
```
In the corrected code, we have added a check to ensure that if any of the values in the array are `NaN` and the target dtype is an integer, a `ValueError` will be raised, preventing the invalid conversion from occurring.
