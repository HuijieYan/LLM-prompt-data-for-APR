The error seems to be occurring in the quantile method of the DataFrame class in the pandas library.

The most likely source of the problem is the line `self._check_percentile(q)`. This line is calling a method `_check_percentile` on the DataFrame object, passing in `q` as the only argument.

Looking at the error, TypeError: Object of type 'method' has no len(), it suggests that the code is attempting to get the length of a method, which is not allowed. The `self._check_percentile(q)` line is passing the method itself, rather than calling it. This is likely because `self._check_percentile` is assigned a bound method, which needs to be called as `self._check_percentile()`. This is inconsistent with other method calls in the code. 

To fix the bug, the `_check_percentile` method needs to be called with `q` as a parameter. 

Here's the corrected code for the DataFrame class with the buggy function fixed:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    ...
    """

    # Call the _check_percentile method
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self

    # ... (omitted code)

    return result
```
