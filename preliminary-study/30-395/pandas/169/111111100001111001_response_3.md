The bug occurs because the `quantile` method assumes that there's a method named `_check_percentile` defined in the same class, which should be responsible for validating the input `q`, but based on the provided input, the `_check_percentile` is not available in the class, leading to an AttributeError.

Additionally, the function assumes that `self._get_numeric_data` should be a method, but based on the input, it seems to be a DataFrame. This leads to another AttributeError.

To fix the bug, the method should directly validate the `q` value, rather than relying on an undefined method `_check_percentile` and fix any other method or attribute references based on the input parameters and the original purpose of the function.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data.quantile(
        q=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation
    )

    if isinstance(q, list):
        result = self._constructor(result.T)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    return result
```

In this corrected version, the input `q` is directly utilized for computing the quantiles. The method `_get_numeric_data` is invoked based on the provided input type, and other methods and attributes are used as DataFrame methods, rather than assuming their type.
