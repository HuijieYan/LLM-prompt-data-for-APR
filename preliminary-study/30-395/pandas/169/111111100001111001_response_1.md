Upon reviewing the given function and the runtime values, it seems that the error occurs when the function is accessed with the provided input parameters. The 'self._check_percentile' function is a part of 'NDFrame' class, and the 'DataFrame' class is inherited from the 'NDFrame' class. This indicates a proper inheritance structure.

The error seems to be occurring due to the use of methods like '_get_numeric_data', '_get_axis_number', and '_data' without explicitly referencing the context of the object invoking these methods in the 'quantile' function, leading to incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, these methods should be referred to with respect to the invoking object. Additionally, the input parameters should be correctly processed based on their types to avoid errors during execution.

Here is the corrected code for the 'quantile' function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)
    
    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1
    
    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._mgr.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In this corrected code:
- Replaced '.data' with '._mgr' as 'data' is not directly accessed within the 'DataFrame' class.
- Used correct references for methods '_get_numeric_data', '_get_axis_number'.
- Removed unnecessary references such as 'data.column' and 'cols'.
- Used 'self' context for any object-related method or property access inside the function.
