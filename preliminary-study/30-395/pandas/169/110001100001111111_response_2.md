The bug seems to be occurring in the `quantile` method of the `DataFrame` class. The error message "ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate" suggests that there is an issue with concatenating the data, which might be related to the handling of datetime data in the `quantile` method.

The issue appears to be related to the handling of datetime and timedelta data in the `quantile` method. The buggy method doesn't handle datetime data correctly, leading to the ValueError when trying to concatenate the data.

To fix this issue, a potential approach could involve explicitly converting the datetime and timedelta data to numeric data before applying the quantile calculation. Additionally, the code should handle the data types correctly in the calculation process to avoid any concatenation issues.

Here's the corrected code for the `quantile` method:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if numeric_only:
        data = self._get_numeric_data()
    else:
        data = self.apply(pd.to_numeric, errors='ignore')

    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In the corrected code:
- The `pd.to_numeric` function is applied to the data if `numeric_only` is False to handle datetime and timedelta data appropriately.
- The calculation process is modified to ensure correct handling of the data types, avoiding any concatenation issues.
