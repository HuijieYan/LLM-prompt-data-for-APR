The test case `test_quantile_empty_no_columns` creates a DataFrame with a datetime index and no columns, and then calls the `quantile` method on this DataFrame with a float value as its argument. The test is intended to ensure that the `quantile` method handles the case when the DataFrame has no columns and produces the expected output. However, the test fails with a `ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate` error.

The potential error location within the `quantile` method is where it tries to concatenate arrays, as indicated by the error message.

The bug occurs because when the DataFrame has no columns, the `data._data` attribute is an empty `BlockManager`, and the `quantile` method tries to concatenate arrays from this empty `BlockManager`, leading to the `ValueError`.

To fix the bug, we should add a check in the `quantile` method to handle the case when the DataFrame has no columns and return an empty Series or DataFrame accordingly.

Here's the corrected `quantile` method:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    # ... (existing code) ...

    # Check for empty DataFrame
    if len(self.columns) == 0:
        if isinstance(q, list):
            return pd.DataFrame([], index=q, columns=[])
        else:
            return pd.Series([], index=[], name=q)

    # ... (existing code) ...
```

With this correction, the `quantile` method will detect when the DataFrame has no columns and return an empty Series or DataFrame, preventing the `ValueError` that was previously occurring.
