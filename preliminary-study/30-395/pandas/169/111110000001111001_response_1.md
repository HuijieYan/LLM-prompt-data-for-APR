The buggy function `quantile` appears to be an instance method of the `DataFrame` class in the pandas library. The purpose of this method is to calculate the quantiles over the specified axis and return the result as either a Series or DataFrame.

The bug seems to be mainly due to the use of a deprecated or invalid method or attribute. Specifically, the method `_check_percentile` is called, but it's unclear what the intended function of this method is. Additionally, the references to methods within the `DataFrame` class such as `_get_numeric_data` and `_get_axis_number` appear to be incorrect, leading to issues in the subsequent processing logic of the method. Lastly, the conditional handling of `if result.ndim == 2` should be reviewed for its accuracy.

To fix these issues, the following steps can be taken:
1. Remove the reference to `_check_percentile` unless it's a custom method intended to be used within the `quantile` method.
2. Review and update the usage of methods `_get_numeric_data` and `_get_axis_number`. Ensure that these methods are called correctly and that the returned values are used appropriately.
3. Verify the conditional logic related to `if result.ndim == 2`. It might be necessary to revise the logic based on the specific requirements and the expected structure of the result.

Below is the corrected code for the `quantile` method:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    # Exclude the reference to unknown function _check_percentile
    # _get_numeric_data and _get_axis_number should be used appropriately
    
    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    # Perform the calculation to get the result
    result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation)

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

It's important to note that the corrected solution provided above assumes that the appropriate methods and logic are available within the pandas library for performing the quantile calculation. If the behavior of the quantile calculation is expected to be more complex, the solution might need further customization.
