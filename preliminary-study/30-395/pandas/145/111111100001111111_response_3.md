The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is likely being caused by the incorrect handling of the `right` input parameter, which is a Series. The function is designed to perform various operations based on the type and properties of the `right` input parameter, but some of these checks and operations are not correctly implemented, leading to the bug.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `right` input parameter is correctly handled in all the conditional branches of the `dispatch_to_series` function. This would involve updating the conditional checks and related code to handle the Series input parameter appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        if axis == "columns":
            assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        else:
            assert right.index.equals(left.index)

            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected code, we have added an additional condition to handle the case where `right` is an `ABCSeries` and the `axis` is not "columns". We also adjusted the conditional blocks and function logic to ensure that the `right` input parameter is correctly handled in all cases. Additionally, we include appropriate type checks and error handling to ensure that the function behaves as expected based on the type and properties of the `right` input parameter.
