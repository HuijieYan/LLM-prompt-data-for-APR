The error occurs when the function `dispatch_to_series` is called by the test function `test_td64_op_nat_casting`. In this test case, a DataFrame `df` is being multiplied by a Series `ser`. The error message indicates that there is an issue with unsupported operand types for * (multiplication) - specifically, the operation involves a numpy array and a 'NaTType'.

The bug is likely to be caused by the fact that in the function `dispatch_to_series`, the operation involving the DataFrame and the Series may be using unsupported operand types, leading to the TypeError.

To fix this bug, the function needs to specifically handle the case where the operation involves a numpy array and a 'NaTType' (Not a Time), ensuring that the operation is handled correctly.

Here is the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    if isinstance(right, pd.Series):
        # Handle the case where the operation involves a numpy array and a 'NaTType'
        if isinstance(right.iloc[0], pd._libs.tslibs.nattype.NaTType):
            new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right), axis=0)
        else:
            new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right), axis=1)
    else:
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right), axis=1)

    return new_data
```

In this corrected code, we specifically handle the case where the operation involves a numpy array and a 'NaTType' by using the `apply` method to apply the operation column-wise. This approach ensures that the operation is handled correctly in cases where it previously resulted in a TypeError.
