The issue seems to be occurring due to incorrect assignment and usage of the variables `a` and `b` in the nested functions `column_op` inside the `dispatch_to_series` function.

The bug is in the nested function `column_op`. The assignment of `a.iloc[:, i]` and `b` is incorrect, causing the bug.

To fix the bug, the correct values for `a` and `b` should be used. Additionally, it seems like `lib` and `np` are not defined in the code, which will need to be imported for the code to function properly.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    right = pd.api.types.union_scalar_types(right)
    if pd.api.types.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, pd.DataFrame):
        assert pd.api.types.is_list_like(right)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, pd.Series) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, pd.Series):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = pd.core.computation.expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected code:
- The import statements for pandas and numpy have been added.
- The `lib` variable has been replaced with `pd.api.types`.
- The `right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)` line is replaced with `right = pd.api.types.union_scalar_types(right)`.
- The `np` method is replaced with `np` as it seems to be referring to the numpy library.
- The value for `a` and `b` inside the `column_op` function has been corrected to use `.iloc` method with the correct indexing.
