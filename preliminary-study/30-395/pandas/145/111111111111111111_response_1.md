The error occurs when the `dispatch_to_series` function is called in the `test_td64_op_nat_casting` test. The error message indicates that there is an unsupported operand type for the multiplication operation involving a `numpy.ndarray` and 'NaTType' (Not a Time). This leads to a `TypeError` as the operation is not supported.

The issue occurs because the `dispatch_to_series` function does not handle the NaN values (specifically 'NaT' for timedelta64 dtype) appropriately when performing the arithmetic operations on DataFrames.

To fix the bug, you can modify the `column_op` dictionary comprehension in the `dispatch_to_series` function to handle the 'NaT' values appropriately. This can be done by using the `pd.isna` function to check for NaN values before performing the operation. If a NaN value is encountered, the operation can simply return the NaN value instead of attempting the operation.

Here's the corrected `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    # ... other code ...

    def column_op(a, b):
        if pd.isna(b):  # Check for NaN value
            # Return NaN value
            return {i: b for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        else:
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    # ... remaining code ...
```

With this modification, the `dispatch_to_series` function should handle the 'NaT' values appropriately and avoid the `TypeError` when performing arithmetic operations.
