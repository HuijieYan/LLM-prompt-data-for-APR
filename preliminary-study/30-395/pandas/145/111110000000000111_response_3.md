The potential error in the provided function is that it is not properly handling the different types of input data. It seems like the function is designed to perform operations between a DataFrame and a scalar, another DataFrame, or a Series.

The error occurs because the function is checking for the type of the 'right' input to determine how to perform the operation, but it is not handling all possible cases correctly, resulting in a NotImplementedError if 'right' is not one of the expected types.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to handle all possible input types (scalar, DataFrame, and Series) and perform the operation accordingly.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    if isinstance(right, (int, float)):
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))
    elif isinstance(right, pd.DataFrame):
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))
    elif isinstance(right, pd.Series):
        if axis == "columns":
            new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right), axis=1)
        else:
            new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))
    else:
        raise ValueError("Unsupported type for 'right'")

    return new_data
```

This corrected function uses `apply` to apply the `func` to the DataFrame `left` based on the type of `right` input and the specified `axis`. This implementation will handle operations between a DataFrame and a scalar, another DataFrame, or a Series correctly.
