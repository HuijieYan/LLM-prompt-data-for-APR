Potential error location:
The potential error location is in the `column_op` functions, which are defined based on different conditions but do not seem to be utilized correctly when evaluating the frame operation `func(left, right)`.

Reasons behind the bug:
The bug occurs because the `column_op` functions are not being used correctly with the conditions specified in the function. As a result, the function may not be dispatching to the Series implementation as intended.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Verify the conditions for `lib.is_scalar(right)`, `isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame)`, and `isinstance(right, ABCSeries)` to ensure that the correct `column_op` function is being utilized based on the input parameters.
2. Ensure that the `column_op` functions are properly implemented to handle the specific cases of scalar, DataFrame, and Series inputs.

Corrected code:
```python
import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
import numpy as np
from pandas import DataFrame
from pandas import Series
from pandas.core.ops.common import is_scalar
from pandas.core.ops.invalid import InvalidComparison 
from pandas.core.base import ABCDataFrame, ABCSeries
from pandas.core import nanops, algorithms

def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    right = is_scalar(right)
    
    if right or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        column_op = lambda a, b: {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        column_op = lambda a, b: {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis in [None, 1, 'columns']:
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        column_op = lambda a, b: {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        column_op = lambda a, b: {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise InvalidComparison(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
