The error occurs in the `column_op` function inside the `dispatch_to_series` function when the right argument is a Series with timedelta data type. The specific operation that causes the error is accessing `b.iloc[i]` where `b` is the Series containing timedelta data. 

The error occurs because the NumPy library does not support arithmetic operations between numpy arrays and NaTType (Not a Time) values. When the operation `a.iloc[:, i] * b.iloc[i]` is performed, it encounters this unsupported operand type.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `column_op` function to handle this specific case for timedelta data type of the right argument.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to check the data type of the elements in the Series before performing the operation. If the data type is timedelta, we can exclude the NaT values from the operation. This can be achieved using the `notna` function provided by pandas to create a mask that excludes the NaT values from the operation.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            if b.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]':
                mask = notna(b)
                return {i: func(a[mask], b[mask]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            else:
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the modified `column_op` function, we added a check for the data type of Series `b`. If the dtype is timedelta, we apply the mask to exclude NaT values from the operation. Otherwise, we perform the operation without any modification.
