Potential error location: The potential error location within the problematic function is in the different `column_op` functions. They are not defined correctly and are causing the buggy behavior.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the `column_op` functions are not defined correctly, and this is causing the `dispatch_to_series` function to fail.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Define the `column_op` function correctly with the proper arguments and logic for different types of input `right` (scalar, DataFrame, Series) and then call it in the `dispatch_to_series` function based on the type of input `right`.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    #       with non-unique columns.

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
