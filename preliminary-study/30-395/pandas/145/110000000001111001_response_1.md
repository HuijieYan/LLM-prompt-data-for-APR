The issue seems to be with the `column_op` function inside the `dispatch_to_series` function. It appears that the input types are not handled correctly in the `column_op` function. Also, in the input and expected value section, it looks like there are discrepancies in the expected and actual types of a few variables.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `column_op` function handles the input types correctly and matches the expected types.

Here's the corrected `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
import pandas as pd

def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    if isinstance(right, pd.Series):
        new_data = {i: func(left.iloc[:, i], right) for i in range(len(left.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, pd.DataFrame):
        new_data = {i: func(left.iloc[:, i], right.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(left.columns))}
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError("Unhandled type for 'right'")

    return pd.DataFrame(new_data)
```

In the corrected code, we have removed the unnecessary import statement within the function and simplified the `column_op` branching logic. Now, the function should handle different types of input correctly and return the expected output.
