The error occurs in the `dispatch_to_series` function in the `pandas.core.ops.__init__.py` file. The error is caused by the line `result = np.empty(x.size, dtype=x.dtype)` in the `masked_arith_op` function, which is called from the `na_arithmetic_op` function.

The issue is that the operation is being performed between an array and `NaT` (Not a Time) type, which is not supported. This occurs due to the combination of a DataFrame and a Series, where the Series contains `NaT` values.

To fix the bug, the code needs to be modified to handle `NaT` values properly when performing arithmetic operations between a DataFrame and a Series.

Here's the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not pd.isna(b) else b for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) if not pd.isna(b.iloc[i]) else b.iloc[i] for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if not pd.isna(b.iloc[i]) else b.iloc[i] for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not pd.isna(b) else b for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

The modified code includes checks for `NaT` values using `pd.isna` to handle the arithmetic operations involving DataFrame and Series containing `NaT` values. This will prevent the TypeError from occurring when performing the arithmetic operations.
