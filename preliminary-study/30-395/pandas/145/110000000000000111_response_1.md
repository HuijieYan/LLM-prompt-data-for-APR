The potential error in the function `dispatch_to_series` is in the handling of the `right` argument, specifically in the checks for its type and the subsequent operation based on its type.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle all possible types of the `right` argument correctly, leading to potential errors or unexpected behavior when different types of data are passed as `right`.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to handle different types of the `right` argument properly and perform the corresponding operation based on its type.

Here's the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
from pandas.core.common import ABCDataFrame, ABCSeries
from pandas.core.common import lib

def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In this corrected code, we have updated the checks for the `right` argument to handle different types such as scalar, DataFrame, and Series correctly, and perform the corresponding operations based on its type. Additionally, we have added assertions to ensure data integrity in each case to prevent unexpected behavior.
