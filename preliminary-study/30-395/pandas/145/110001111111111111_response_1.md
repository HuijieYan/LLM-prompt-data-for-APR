The error message indicates that the bug occurs when using a timedelta64 series (`ser`) to perform an arithmetic operation with a DataFrame (`df`). The issue seems to be related to the handling of NaT (Not a Time) values during the arithmetic operation, which causes a TypeError.

The problem lies in the `column_op` function within the `dispatch_to_series` function. When performing the operation `op(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i])`, the presence of NaT values in the timedelta64 Series `b` is causing a TypeError due to unsupported operand types for the multiplication operation.

To fix this bug, the `column_op` function needs to be modified to handle the NaT values correctly when performing the arithmetic operation with the DataFrame.

Here's the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    # with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return a.apply(lambda x: func(x, b))

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return a.apply(lambda x: func(x, b[x.name]), axis=1)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return a.apply(lambda x: func(x, b[x.name]), axis=1)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return a.apply(lambda x: func(x, b))

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected code, the `column_op` function uses the `apply` method to apply the arithmetic operation element-wise, handling NaT values correctly. This approach ensures that the NaT values are appropriately handled during the arithmetic operation between the DataFrame and the timedelta64 Series.
