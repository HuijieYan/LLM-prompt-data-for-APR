The bug is likely related to the use of the `right` variable, which is a Series, within the `column_op` function. The error message indicates that there are issues with the operation involving `a.iloc[:, i]` and `b` in the `column_op` function.

The bug is occurring because the code tries to iterate over the columns of the DataFrame `a` and apply an operation with the corresponding column of the Series `b`. However, the two objects have different shapes, leading to the error.

To fix this bug and make the code work as expected, the correction in the `column_op` function should involve aligning the shapes of the DataFrame and the Series before applying the operation.

```python
import pandas as pd

def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right), axis=0)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected code, the `apply` function is used to apply the `func` operation to each column of the DataFrame `left` with the Series `right`. This approach ensures that the operation is applied correctly to align the shapes of the DataFrame and the Series.
