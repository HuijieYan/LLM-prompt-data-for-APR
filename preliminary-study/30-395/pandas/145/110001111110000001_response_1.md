The test case is attempting to multiply a DataFrame by a Series containing "NaT" values, which represent missing values for timedelta data. The error message suggests that the operation is attempting to perform multiplication between a numpy array and a NaTType, which is not supported.

The potential error location within the `dispatch_to_series` function is in the `column_op` definition:
```python
def column_op(a, b):
    return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
```
The error occurs because `b` can contain "NaT" values, and this function is not handling "NaT" values correctly.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `column_op` function to handle the case where `b` contains "NaT" values. We should check for "NaT" values and handle them appropriately when performing the arithmetic operation.

Here's the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function with the modified `column_op` function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            result = {}
            for i in range(len(a.columns)):
                if b.iloc[i] is pd.NaT:
                    result[i] = pd.NaT
                else:
                    result[i] = func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i])
            return result
    
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```
In the modified `column_op` function, we added a check for "NaT" values in the `b` Series. If the value at index `i` is "NaT", we directly assign "NaT" to the result without performing the arithmetic operation. Otherwise, we perform the arithmetic operation as before. This modification ensures that the function handles "NaT" values correctly when performing arithmetic operations.
