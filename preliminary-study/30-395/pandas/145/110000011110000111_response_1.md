The error occurs in the `dispatch_to_series` function. The error message indicates that the function is unable to perform the multiplication operation between an array and NaTType (Not a Time) due to unsupported operand types.

The potential issue is that the function is not handling the case where the operand is of type NaTType (Not a Time) properly. This is likely leading to a type error when attempting to perform the multiplication.

To fix the bug, the function should handle the case where the right operand is of type NaTType and ensure that the operation is conducted appropriately.

Here's the corrected code:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
