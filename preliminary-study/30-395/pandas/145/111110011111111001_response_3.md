The error occurs in the `dispatch_to_series` function when the `expressions.evaluate` method is called with the `column_op`. The error message indicates that the issue is with the `unsupported operand type for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'`, suggesting that the function is encountering an unsupported operation involving the 'NaTType'.

The bug is likely occurring due to the use of the operation involving NaT (Not a Time) type in the `column_op`. NaT is a special scalar value recognized by NumPy and it cannot be used in arithmetic operations like multiplication directly.

To fix this issue, one possible approach is to handle the NaT values within the `column_op` function and perform the operation accordingly. This can be achieved by checking for the presence of NaT values and handling them appropriately before performing the arithmetic operation.

Here's the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Import necessary libraries
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
    import numpy as np

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            if pd.isna(b):
                # Handle NaT values in the scalar 'right'
                return {i: b for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            else:
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    # Remaining code after this block remains the same as it was in the original function.

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected code, the `column_op` function now includes conditional checks to handle the case when the scalar 'right' contains NaT values. This helps prevent the unsupported operand type error and provides a way to handle operations involving NaT values appropriately.
