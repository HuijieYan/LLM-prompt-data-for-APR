The error message indicates that the problem is occurring when the function `dispatch_to_series` is called with the `*` operator on a DataFrame and a Series with `NaT` values. It seems that the `dispatch_to_series` function is trying to perform multiplication on a DataFrame and Series with `NaT` values, which might be causing the error.

The bug is occurring in the `column_op` function within the `dispatch_to_series` function. This is because the code is trying to perform operations (`func`) on `NaT` values, which are not supported for certain operations like multiplication.

To fix this issue, we need to handle `NaT` values when performing operations within the `column_op` function.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not pd.isna(b) else np.nan for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    # ... other conditions for handling different types of 'right' ...

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected code, I have added a check for `NaT` values using the `pd.isna` function to handle the `NaT` values appropriately for the operation. If the `b` value (from `a.iloc[:, i]` and `b`) is `NaT`, it will return `np.nan` in the result dictionary. This will prevent the `TypeError` encountered previously when trying to perform operations with `NaT` values.
