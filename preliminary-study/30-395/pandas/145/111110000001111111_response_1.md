The bug is likely in the section of the code that constructs the `column_op` function. The error message indicates that there is an issue with accessing elements in the Series with an `iloc` attribute.

The bug occurs because the `column_op` function attempts to access elements using `iloc` from the input DataFrame or Series without checking whether those objects have this attribute. 

To fix the bug, you need to modify the `column_op` function to access elements considering the type of the input objects (DataFrame or Series) and handle the operation accordingly.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = pd.computation.expressions.lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if pd.computation.expressions.lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, pd.DataFrame):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index) and right.columns.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, pd.Series) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, pd.Series):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected code:
- The handling of different input types (scalar, DataFrame, and Series) has been improved within the `column_op` function.
- Validation has been added to ensure that DataFrame and Series indices and columns match when required.
- Proper library references have been used to access internal functions and attributes.
