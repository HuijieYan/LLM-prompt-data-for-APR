The error message indicates a TypeError being raised due to unsupported operand types ('numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType') for the multiplication operation.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `masked_arith_op` function, which is called from the `na_arithmetic_op` function. Specifically, the error occurs when attempting the arithmetic operation on the input arrays.

The bug occurs because the function is not handling the NaT (Not a Time) values correctly during the arithmetic operation with numpy arrays.

To fix the bug, the `masked_arith_op` function needs to be modified to handle the NaT values appropriately when performing the arithmetic operation. This can be achieved by explicitly checking for NaT values in the input arrays and applying the operation only to the non-NaT elements.

Here's the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    def column_op(a, b):
        return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```
