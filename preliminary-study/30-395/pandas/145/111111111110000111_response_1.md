The error occurs when the test function test_td64_op_nat_casting attempts to multiply a DataFrame `df` with a Series `ser` that contains "NaT" as a value. This triggers a TypeError due to unsupported operand types for the operation.

The potential error location within the code is in the `dispatch_to_series` function at the `column_op` definition. The error occurs because the `column_op` function is not handling the case where the second operand is NaT, which is a missing value for time.

The issue stems from the fact that the `column_op` function doesn't handle the case where the right operand is NaT. As a result, when the operation is performed between the DataFrame and the Series containing "NaT", it leads to a TypeError.

To fix the bug, the `column_op` function should include a check for the type of the right operand. If it is NaT, it should handle this case separately to avoid the TypeError.

Here's the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            if pd.isna(b):
                # Handle the case where the right operand is NA or NaT
                return {i: np.nan for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            else:
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    # ... (other cases)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
