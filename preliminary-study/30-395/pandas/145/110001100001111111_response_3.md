The bug likely arises from the incorrect handling of the "right" input within the "dispatch_to_series" function. The function should be updated to correctly handle the input to resolve the bug.

To resolve this issue, the "right" input should be properly handled based on its type and properties. Additionally, it is important to ensure that the correct attributes and methods are used with the "a" and "b" inputs to perform the desired operations.

Here's the corrected code for the "dispatch_to_series" function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    if isinstance(right, pd.Series):
        if right.index.equals(left.index):
            new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right), axis=1)
        elif axis == "columns" and right.index.equals(left.columns):
            new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right), axis=0)
        else:
            raise ValueError("Index mismatch between 'left' and 'right'")
    elif isinstance(right, (int, float)):
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))
    else:
        raise ValueError("Unsupported type for 'right'")

    return new_data
```

In this corrected code, we properly handle the "right" input based on its type and properties. We check whether it is a Series and then compare the indices with the "left" DataFrame. Based on this comparison, we perform the operation either row-wise or column-wise. If the "right" input is a scalar, we apply the operation element-wise to each column of the "left" DataFrame. We also handle the case where the type of "right" is unsupported and raise a ValueError accordingly.
