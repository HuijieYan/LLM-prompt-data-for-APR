The error is likely caused by the mismatch in the dimension and type of the 'right' and 'b' variables. 'right' is a Series, while 'b' is an ndarray. Additionally, 'right' is being passed as a scalar in certain conditions which might not be compatible with the subsequent operations.

To fix the bug, we need to update the 'column_op' function to handle the input type 'Series' correctly and ensure it aligns with the code logic for each condition. We also need to ensure that appropriate data types and dimensions are maintained throughout the function.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = pd.Series(right) if not isinstance(right, pd.Series) else right

    if axis == "columns" and isinstance(right, pd.Series):
        if right.index.equals(left.columns):
            def column_op(a, b):
                return pd.DataFrame({i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.values) for i in range(len(a.columns))})
        else:
            raise ValueError("Incompatible index for Series 'right' and DataFrame 'left'")

    elif isinstance(right, pd.DataFrame):
        if right.shape[0] != left.shape[0] or not right.index.equals(left.index):
            raise ValueError("Incompatible index or shape for DataFrame 'right' and DataFrame 'left'")

        def column_op(a, b):
            return pd.DataFrame({i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))})

    else:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return pd.DataFrame({i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))})

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected code handles different scenarios by verifying the index and shape compatibility of 'left' and 'right' inputs and ensures that the operations are performed accordingly. Additionally, for the case when 'right' is passed as a scalar, it is converted to a Series to maintain compatibility with the subsequent operations.
