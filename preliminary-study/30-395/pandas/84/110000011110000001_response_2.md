The error is occurring in the `_get_level_number` function because it is unable to find the level 'A' in the list of names. This is likely due to passing a tuple ('A', 'a') instead of a string as the level name.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle the input level correctly and not pass it directly to the `_get_level_number` function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the code remains the same
```

By checking if the level is a tuple and then calling `_get_level_number` method, we ensure that the function can handle both strings and tuples as level names, thereby fixing the bug.
