The issue is related to the unstacking of a MultiIndex with tuple names, which leads to a KeyError when trying to unstack by the given tuple names.

The potential error location is within the `_unstack_multiple` function, specifically when trying to get the level number for each element in the `clocs` list using the `index._get_level_number(i)`. The error occurs when trying to access the level by a tuple name which is not found, leading to a KeyError.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `_unstack_multiple` function does not handle Tuple names correctly when trying to unstack a MultiIndex. The function assumes that the input will be always a list of integers representing the levels to unstack, rather than handling Tuple names as well.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle both cases, where the input could be a list of integers and a tuple of names.

The corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function is as follows:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Handle Tuple names as input
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        index = data.index
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    elif isinstance(clocs, list):
        # Handle regular list of indices
        pass

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    
    # ... rest of the function code remains unchanged ...
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the input `clocs` is a tuple of names, and if so, we handle the Tuple names by getting the level number for each element in the tuple. Otherwise, if it's a list, we assume it contains the level numbers as before. This change allows the function to handle both cases and avoid the KeyError when unstacking a MultiIndex with tuple names.
