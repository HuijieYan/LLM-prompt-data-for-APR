The error occurs in the `_unstack_multiple` function, particularly in the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`. The error message indicates that the `_get_level_number` function within the MultiIndex class is unable to find the level named 'A'.

The reason for this error is that the tuple names are not being handled correctly when passed to the `unstack` method. The function expects the level parameter to be a single label or a sequence of labels, but it's unable to handle the tuple names within the MultiIndex.

To fix this bug, the code should be updated to handle the tuple names correctly. This can be done by modifying the `_unstack_multiple` function to identify and handle tuple names properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    cloc_numbers = []
    for cloc in clocs:
        if isinstance(cloc, tuple):
            cloc_number = tuple([index.names.index(name) for name in cloc])
        else:
            cloc_number = index._get_level_number(cloc)
        cloc_numbers.append(cloc_number)

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # (Remaining code for unstacking ...)
```

In this corrected function, the `clocs` are iterated, and if a `cloc` is a tuple, it identifies the corresponding level numbers for the tuple names. This modification allows the function to handle tuple names correctly when passed to the `unstack` method.
