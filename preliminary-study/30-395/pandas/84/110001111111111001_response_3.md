## Analysis
The error is occurring because the `clocs` variable is being passed as a tuple to the `_unstack_multiple` function, and then it is trying to find the level numbers for each element of the tuple. However, since the `clocs` variable is a tuple of strings, it cannot be directly used as levels of the MultiIndex, leading to the error.

## Bug Reason
The bug is caused because the `clocs` variable is a tuple of strings which cannot be used directly to get level numbers from a MultiIndex.

## Possible Approaches
We need to update the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle the `clocs` variable appropriately. It should be able to identify the correct levels from the MultiIndex based on the tuple of strings.

## Code
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Ensure clocs is a list to handle both single and multiple levels
    clocs = [clocs] if isinstance(clocs, tuple) else clocs
    
    index = data.index
    
    clevel_numbers = []
    for cloc in clocs:
        # Check if the cloc is a tuple, indicating multi-level index
        if isinstance(cloc, tuple):
            temp = cloc
            for loc in temp:
                clevel_numbers.append(index._get_level_number(loc))
        else:
            clevel_numbers.append(index._get_level_number(cloc))

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clevel_numbers]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clevel_numbers]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clevel_numbers]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clevel_numbers]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # ... (remaining code remains unchanged)
```
In the modified code:
- If `clocs` is a tuple, the function iterates through its elements to get the level numbers from the MultiIndex.
- The rest of the code remains unchanged.

By handling the `clocs` variable appropriately, the function should now be able to unstack the MultiIndex based on the provided levels.
