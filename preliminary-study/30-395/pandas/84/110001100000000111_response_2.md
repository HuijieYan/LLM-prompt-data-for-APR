Potential error location: The error is occurring in the `_unstack_multiple` function, particularly in the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`.

Reasons behind the bug: The error message indicates that the function is unable to find the level specified in the MultiIndex. This suggests that the level specified in the parameter `clocs` is not being recognized or found within the index.

Approaches for fixing the bug: We need to ensure that the level specified in `clocs` is correct and can be found within the MultiIndex. This may involve checking for the existence of the level and handling cases where it may not be found.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, (str, tuple)) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
```
