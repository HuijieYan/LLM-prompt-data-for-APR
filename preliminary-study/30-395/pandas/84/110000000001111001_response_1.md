The code is designed to unstack a DataFrame with a multi-level index. However, there are several issues with the function that need to be addressed.

The bug seems to be occurring because the function is not handling hierarchical indices properly. It's failing when the number of indices to be unstacked is more than one.

To fix the bug:
1. Handle the case when multiple levels need to be unstacked. The function should unstack one level at a time in a loop until all specified levels are unstacked.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(loc) for loc in clocs]

    # Unstack one level at a time
    unstacked_data = data
    for loc in clocs:
        unstacked_data = unstacked_data.unstack(level=loc, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked_data
```
