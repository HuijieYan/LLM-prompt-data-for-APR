The issue seems to be occurring when a MultiIndex is unstacked using a tuple of names as the level. The error message indicates that the 'A' level is not found in the MultiIndex, leading to a KeyError.

The potential error in the function `_unstack_multiple` seems to be when determining the level number using `index._get_level_number(i)` for each item in `clocs`. This might be leading to the 'A' level not being found in the list of names.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is trying to get the level number using the entire tuple ('A', 'a') instead of just 'A' or 'a'. This causes the level name to not be found as it's a tuple and not a single level name.

To fix this bug, the function `_unstack_multiple` should be modified to handle the tuple of names correctly. It should first check if the level is a single name or a tuple of names, and then extract the correct level name to get the level number.

Here's the corrected function `_unstack_multiple`:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    new_clocs = []
    for cloc in clocs:
        if isinstance(cloc, tuple):
            for name in cloc:
                new_clocs.append(index._get_level_number(name))
        else:
            new_clocs.append(index._get_level_number(cloc))

    # rest of the function remains as is...
```

This modification ensures that if the level is a tuple of names, it iterates through each name to properly extract the level number. This should resolve the issue of the 'A' level not being found.
