The test case involves using the `unstack` method on a Series with a MultiIndex, specifying a tuple of names as the `level` parameter. The error message suggests that the error occurs when the function tries to get the level number for the specified names, 'A' and 'a'.

The potential error location within the problematic function is when the function tries to get the level number using the `_get_level_number` method on the index.

The bug is occurring because the function is trying to get the level number of a MultiIndex using a tuple of names. However, the implementation of `_get_level_number` does not handle tuple names correctly, leading to the error.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle tuple names correctly and retrieve the level number accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        cloc_numbers = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    else:
        cloc_numbers = [index._get_level_number(clocs)]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

In the corrected code, we first check whether `clocs` is a tuple. If it is a tuple, we use a list comprehension to get the level numbers for each name in the tuple. If it is not a tuple, we directly get the level number for the single name. This change ensures that tuple names are handled correctly when getting the level numbers, addressing the bug.
