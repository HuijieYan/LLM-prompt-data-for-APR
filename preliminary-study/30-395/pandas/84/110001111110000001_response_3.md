The error message indicates that the function `_get_level_number` is encountering an issue while trying to determine the level number for the given input. The error occurs when it tries to find the index of the level provided, and it's not able to find it, leading to a KeyError or ValueError based on the test case.

The root cause of this bug is that the function is expecting the level to be in the `self.names` list, but in the problematic test cases, the level is a tuple instead of a single string, which leads to the failure of the function.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to properly handle the case where the level input is a tuple. If the level is a tuple, we should iterate over each element of the tuple and find its index in `self.names`. Additionally, we should consider improving the error handling to provide more informative error messages.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    # Handle the case where clocs is a tuple
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        level_numbers = []
        for loc in clocs:
            level_number = index._get_level_number(loc)
            level_numbers.append(level_number)
    else:
        level_numbers = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in level_numbers]
    
    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
    # (Remaining code is unchanged)
    # ...
```

With this modification, the `_unstack_multiple` function should now be able to handle both single levels and tuples of levels, providing the correct level number in each case.
