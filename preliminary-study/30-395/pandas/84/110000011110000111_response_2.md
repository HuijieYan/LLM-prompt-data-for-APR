The error occurs in the `_get_level_number` function. It tries to retrieve the level number of a specific level name in the MultiIndex, but it fails to do so. This is likely due to the format of the level name, which is a tuple in the test case. The function expects the level name to be a single string, not a tuple of strings.

To fix this, we need to modify the `_get_level_number` function to handle a tuple of level names as input.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number((i,)) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
    # ...
    # ...

    return unstacked
```

With this modification, the `_unstack_multiple` function should handle both single string level names and tuple level names, as shown in the test cases. The logic inside the function remains the same, but the input handling for level names is adjusted to accommodate tuples.
