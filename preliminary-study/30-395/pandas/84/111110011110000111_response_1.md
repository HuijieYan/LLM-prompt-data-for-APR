The test cases provided are testing the unstack functionality of a DataFrame with a MultiIndex. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the `_get_level_number` method in the `MultiIndex` class.

The `_get_level_number` method is trying to find the index of a level name within the list of level names. The error message indicates that it's failing to find the level name 'A' in the list of level names.

Looking at the code, the issue seems to be with the way the level names are being passed to the `_get_level_number` method. The argument `clocs`, which represents the level names, is being passed directly to the `_get_level_number` method without proper handling. This is causing the method to fail when it tries to find the index of the level name.

To fix this issue, the `clocs` argument needs to be converted to level numbers before being passed to the `_get_level_number` method. This can be done by obtaining the level numbers corresponding to the level names and then using those numbers to call the `_get_level_number` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Rest of the code remains the same as the original function

    index = data.index

    cloc_numbers = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # Rest of the code remains the same as the original function
    # ...
    # ...

    # Replace the usage of clocs with cloc_numbers in the function

    # clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]  # remove this line
    clocs = cloc_numbers  # use cloc_numbers instead

    # Rest of the code remains the same as the original function
    # ...
    # ...

    return unstacked
```

By converting the level names to level numbers before using them in the `_get_level_number` method, the issue with the unstack function can be resolved.
