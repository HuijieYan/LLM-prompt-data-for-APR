The error in the provided function is likely due to the way the data is being unstacked and reshaped. It seems that the function is not handling multi-level indices correctly, causing issues in the unstacking process.

The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle the hierarchical index (MultiIndex) within the DataFrame. The function attempts to reshape the data using unstacking, and this process fails due to the multi-level nature of the index.

To fix this bug, the function needs to handle multi-level indices properly and account for the hierarchical structure of the index. This can be achieved by using the `pivot` or `unstack` methods based on the specific structure of the multi-level index.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    unstacked = data.unstack(clocs)

    return unstacked
```

This updated code assumes that `clocs` is a valid column or set of columns to unstack the data. It uses the `unstack` method directly on the DataFrame to handle multi-level indices appropriately and reshape the data as intended.
