The error occurs during the execution of the `df.unstack(("A", "a"))` statement. The error is related to the `_unstack_multiple` function, specifically the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`. The error message indicates that the 'A' level is not found, resulting in a KeyError.

The likely reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the `clocs` values are not interpreted correctly as levels from the MultiIndex. This results in the incorrect extraction of level numbers from the index, leading to KeyErrors.

To fix the bug, the code needs to correctly identify and fetch the multi-index level numbers for the specified levels. This can be achieved by modifying the code that extracts level numbers from the index.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    level_numbers = []
    for level_name in clocs:
        try:
            level_num = index.names.index(level_name)
            level_numbers.append(level_num)
        except ValueError:
            if not isinstance(level_name, int):
                raise KeyError(f"Level {level_name} not found")

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in level_numbers]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in level_numbers]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in level_numbers]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in level_numbers]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Remaining code for the function...
```

In the corrected function, we replace the list comprehension with a loop that tries to find the index of the level name in the `index.names` list. If the level name is not found as a string in the `index.names` list, it raises a KeyError. If the level name is found, the corresponding level number is added to the `level_numbers` list for further processing.

This modification ensures that the level names are correctly processed and the level numbers are extracted from the MultiIndex, preventing the occurrence of KeyError when trying to unstack the data.
