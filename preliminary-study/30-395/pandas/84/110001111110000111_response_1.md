The error is occurring in the `_unstack_multiple` function, specifically in the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`, where it's trying to get the level number for each item in `clocs`. The error message indicates that it's failing to find the level name 'A' in the list of names.

The reason behind the bug is that the `clocs` variable contains level names in a MultiIndex, but the `_get_level_number` function is expecting level numbers instead of names. This leads to the KeyError because it cannot find the name in the list of level names.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `clocs` variable to contain level numbers instead of names before passing it to the `_unstack_multiple` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data
    
    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet
    
    index = data.index
    
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]  # Modified to get level numbers
    
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    
    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

By modifying the `clocs` variable to contain level numbers instead of names, we can avoid the KeyError issue and correctly retrieve the level numbers for unstacking the MultiIndex.

This change should fix the bug and allow the function to handle MultiIndexed unstack operations without errors.
