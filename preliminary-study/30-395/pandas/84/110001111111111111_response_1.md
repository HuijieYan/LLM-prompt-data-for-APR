The bug occurs in the `_unstack_multiple` function due to the `index._get_level_number` method failing to handle tuple names in MultiIndex.

The issue arises because of an attempt to use the `_get_level_number` method with tuple names in MultiIndex. This function is not able to handle tuple names, which leads to the `ValueError: 'A' is not in list` and subsequently the `KeyError: 'Level A not found` error.

To fix this bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function needs to handle the case of tuple names in MultiIndex. Additionally, the _get_level_number method should be modified to handle tuple names in MultiIndex more effectively.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    if len(clocs) == 1 and isinstance(clocs[0], tuple):
        cloc_names = [idx for idx in clocs[0]]

        clevels = [index.get_level_values(name) for name in cloc_names]
        rlevels = [index.get_level_values(level) for level in rlocs]

        reshaped = data.unstack(cloc_names)
        reshaped.index = rlevels

        return reshaped

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With this change, the `_unstack_multiple` function can handle tuple names correctly, resolving the error.
