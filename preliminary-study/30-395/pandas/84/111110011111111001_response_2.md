The bug is occurring due to the use of a tuple as the `level` parameter for the `unstack` method which is not handled properly by the `_unstack_multiple` function. The function `_unstack_multiple` is trying to call the private method `_get_level_number` on the `index` object with the tuple `('A', 'a')` as the parameter, which results in a ValueError since the method expects a single level name or number, not a tuple.

To fix the bug, the code needs to be modified to handle the scenario where a tuple is passed as the `level` parameter for the `unstack` method.

Here is the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [clocs]

    cloc_indices = [
        index._get_level_number(cnames) for cnames in clocs
    ]

    rloc_indices = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_indices]

    # Rest of the code remains the same
    # ...
    # (code for other logic)
    # ...
```

With this modification, we are checking if the `clocs` parameter is a tuple and converting it to a list if it is. Then we are using a list comprehension to get the level numbers corresponding to the level names contained in the `clocs` list.

This change allows the function to process a single level name or a tuple of level names properly, ensuring that the bug is fixed.

After this fix, the function should be able to handle a single level name or a tuple of level names correctly, resolving the ValueError that was previously occurring.
