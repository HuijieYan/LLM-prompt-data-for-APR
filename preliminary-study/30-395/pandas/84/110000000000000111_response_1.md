The error occurs when trying to unstack a MultiIndexed Series using tuple names. 

The potential error location within the function is with the line:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that when trying to find the level number for the tuple names, the function `_get_level_number` is unable to handle tuple names, leading to a KeyError.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to handle MultiIndexed Series with tuple names.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(index, MultiIndex):
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index.names.index(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # rest of the code remains the same
```
