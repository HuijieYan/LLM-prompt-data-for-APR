The issue in the code seems to be related to the unstacking operation involving MultiIndex and the handling of different levels and codes. The bug is likely to be caused by the incorrect handling of the input parameters and the subsequent unstacking of the data.

The bug occurs when the input consists of a MultiIndex DataFrame and the unstack_multiple function is called to unstack the data. The function is not handling the MultiIndex structure properly, leading to issues with reshaping the data.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to revise the unstack_multiple function and its logic for handling MultiIndex data. Specifically, the function should properly handle the levels, codes, names, and other properties of the MultiIndex structure, ensuring that the unstacking operation is performed accurately without losing any data.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    unstacked = data.unstack(clocs)
    
    return unstacked
```

In the corrected code, the unstacking operation is performed directly on the input data using the unstack method, which should correctly handle MultiIndex structures and perform the unstacking operation as intended.
