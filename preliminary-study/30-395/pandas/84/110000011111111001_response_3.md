The error occurs in the `_get_level_number` method of the MultiIndex class. It is raised because the level 'A' is not found in the list of names in the MultiIndex. This suggests that the level names are not in the correct format.

The bug is occurring because the function is not handling hierarchical columns properly. It is assumed that the index has only one level ('A', 'a'), when in fact it has more levels due to the hierarchical columns.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle hierarchical columns in the index. This involves identifying the levels and their corresponding codes, names, and numbers. Since the function is supposed to unstack a MultiIndex DataFrame, it should handle all levels of the index.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Check if MultiIndex
    if isinstance(index, pd.MultiIndex):
        # Get all levels present in the index
        levels = [index.levels[i] for i in range(index.nlevels)]
        
        # Replace the previous clocs with their corresponding levels
        clevels = [levels[i] for i in clocs]

        # Unstack based on all levels
        unstacked = data.unstack(level=clevels, fill_value=fill_value)

        return unstacked
    else:
        return data
```

With this correction, the function properly checks for a MultiIndex and handles all levels of the index when unstacking. This should resolve the issue identified in the test cases and the error message.
