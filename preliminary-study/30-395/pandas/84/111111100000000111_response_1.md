The error seems to be occurring when trying to unstack a Series with a MultiIndex. The error message indicates that the level "A" is not found.

The potential error location within the problematic function is when trying to get the level number of the column locations.

The bug is occurring because the function is not correctly handling MultiIndexed columns with tuple names.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to properly handle MultiIndexed columns with tuple names.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index.names.index(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # ... rest of the code remains unchanged ...
    
    return unstacked
```
