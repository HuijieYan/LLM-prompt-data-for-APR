Sure, here's the full code of the fixed function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        cloc_numbers = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    else:
        cloc_numbers = [index._get_level_number(clocs)]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # The remaining code to handle unstacking and restructuring the data would remain unchanged
```

This corrected code includes a modification to correctly handle the case when `clocs` is a tuple of level names, ensuring that the `_get_level_number` function can handle multiple level names. If `clocs` is not a tuple, it is treated as a single level name.
