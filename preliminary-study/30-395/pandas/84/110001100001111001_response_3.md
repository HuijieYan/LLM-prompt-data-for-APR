The primary error in the given function is the absence of proper error handling. This can result in unexpected behavior or errors being raised, as certain conditions aren't properly checked. The function also includes several repetitive checks and conversions between indices, which can be reduced for better readability and efficiency.

To fix the bug, we need to refactor the function to include proper error handling and reduce redundancy in code.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def unstack(obj, level, fill_value=None):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass


def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]

    if rlocs:
        # Create dummy index for MultiIndex
        dummy_index_values = [np.arange(len(level)) for level in clevels[0]]
        dummy_index = pd.MultiIndex.from_product(dummy_index_values, names=index.names)

        unstacked_data = data.unstack(clocs)
        unstacked_data = unstacked_data.reorder_levels(rlocs + clocs)

    else:
        # Regular DataFrame, no need for dummy index
        unstacked_data = data.unstack(clocs)

    return unstacked_data
```
