The error occurs in the `_get_level_number` method of the MultiIndex class. The method is trying to find the index of a level ('A') in the MultiIndex names list, but since the names are tuples, it's not finding a match.

The bug occurs because the `clocs` variable in the `_unstack_multiple` function is a tuple, but the code tries to process it as a list. This causes an error when iterating over `clocs` and calling the `_get_level_number` method.

To fix this bug, the `clocs` variable should be converted to a list if it's a tuple, in order to iterate over its elements correctly. Additionally, the calls to the `_get_level_number` method should be handled appropriately for both tuples and lists.

The corrected function code is as follows:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = list(clocs)
    
    # rest of the code remains the same
```
