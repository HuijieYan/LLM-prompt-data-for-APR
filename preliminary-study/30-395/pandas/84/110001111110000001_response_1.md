The error message suggests that the function `_get_level_number` is raising a `ValueError` because it cannot find the level specified in the multi-index. This means that the function is failing to retrieve the level number for some specified level.

The potential error location within the `_unstack_multiple` function is the following line:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```

The reason behind the bug is that the code is expecting `level` to be in the `names` attribute of the multi-index, but it's not finding it.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the code to handle cases where the specified level is not found in the multi-index names.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if i in index.names else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # ... rest of the function remains unchanged ...
```

In the corrected code, we are checking if the specified level `i` is present in `index.names` before calling `index._get_level_number(i)`. If `i` is not found in the names, we just keep it as it is. This modification ensures that the function doesn't raise an error when the level is not found in the multi-index names.
