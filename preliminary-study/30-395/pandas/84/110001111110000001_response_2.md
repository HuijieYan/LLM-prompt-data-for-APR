The error occurs within the `index._get_level_number()` function in the `_unstack_multiple` method of the provided function. The error message indicates that the level `"A"` is not found, triggering a KeyError or ValueError.

The bug occurs because the method expected the level name as a string, but it is being passed as a tuple `("A", "a")`. There is also an attempt to directly index the `names` list of the MultiIndex with the tuple, which is incorrect.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_level_number` should be modified to handle a tuple input for level names. Additionally, the tuple should be processed to obtain the correct level number from the MultiIndex.

Here's the corrected code for the `unstack` and `_unstack_multiple` functions:

```python
def unstack(obj, level, fill_value=None):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data
    
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def _get_level_number(index, level):
    if isinstance(level, str):
        count = index.names.count(level)
        if (count > 1) and not is_integer(level):
            raise ValueError(f"The name {level} occurs multiple times, use a level number")
        try:
            level = index.names.index(level)
            return level
        except ValueError:
            raise KeyError(f"Level {level} not found")
    elif isinstance(level, tuple):
        level_names = index.names
        level_indices = [level_names.index(name) if name in level_names else None for name in level]
        if None in level_indices:
            raise KeyError(f"Level {level} not found")
        return tuple(level_indices)
    else:
        raise TypeError("Unsupported type for level")
```

This corrected code includes a new function `_get_level_number` which properly handles both string and tuple inputs for levels. If the input level is a string, it is processed as before. If the input level is a tuple, the function looks up the indices for each component of the tuple and returns a tuple of indices. This will resolve the KeyError and ValueError issues related to level names not being found in the MultiIndex.
