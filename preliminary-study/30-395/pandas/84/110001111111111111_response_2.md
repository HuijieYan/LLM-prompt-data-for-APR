The issue seems to be caused by the way the `unstack` function interacts with MultiIndex objects when using tuple names. The error message indicates that the function is unable to find the level 'A' within the list of names.

This could be due to a discrepancy in how the function handles tuple names in MultiIndex objects. The function `_unstack_multiple` attempts to retrieve the level numbers using `index._get_level_number(i)`, but encounters an issue when dealing with tuple names.

One approach to fixing this bug would be to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle tuple names correctly. This could involve adjusting the logic for level retrieval and processing within MultiIndex objects to accommodate tuple names.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    if len(clocs) == 1:  # Handle single level
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs[0], fill_value=fill_value)
    else:  # Handle multi-level
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

This corrected code accounts for both single and multi-level unstacking scenarios and should address the issue with tuple names in MultiIndex objects by modifying the logic of level retrieval and unstacking operations.
