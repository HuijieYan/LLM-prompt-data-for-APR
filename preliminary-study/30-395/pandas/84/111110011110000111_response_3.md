The error seems to be occurring in the `_get_level_number` method of the `MultiIndex` class, which is called within the `_unstack_multiple` function. The error indicates that the level 'A' is not found, causing a `KeyError`.

The issue stems from the fact that the `clocs` variable being passed to `_unstack_multiple` contains a tuple `("A", "a")` as a level, and the function attempts to get the level number for this tuple, which results in the error.

This occurs because the `clocs` variable is not handled properly for tuple names in multi-indexes. The current implementation expects `clocs` to be a list of integers corresponding to the locations of levels within the index. However, when tuple names are used in the multi-index, the current method breaks.

To fix this issue, the `_unstack_multiple` function needs to be updated to handle tuple names in multi-indexes correctly.

The corrected implementation for the `_unstack_multiple` function is as follows:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs[0], tuple):
        clocs = [index.names.index(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

In the corrected implementation, we first check if the `clocs` contain tuples, and if so, we retrieve the index names using `index.names.index(i)` for each tuple in `clocs`. This change allows the function to handle tuple names correctly when unstacking multi-indexes.
