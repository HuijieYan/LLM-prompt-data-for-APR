The test case provided attempts to unstack a Series using a tuple as the level index, i.e., `s.unstack(("A", "a"))`. This is a valid operation in pandas, but it is throwing a KeyError. The error seems to be occurring in the `_unstack_multiple` function, specifically in the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`.

The reason behind the bug is that the function assumes that the names provided in `clocs` exist as levels in the index. However, when a tuple of names is used as the level index, it fails to handle it properly, resulting in a KeyError.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to handle the case where `clocs` contains tuples as level indices. Additionally, proper error handling should be added to ensure that the function can handle all possible combinations of level indices.

The corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function is as follows:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    if any(isinstance(loc, tuple) for loc in clocs):
        clocs = [index.names.index(loc) if isinstance(loc, str) else index.names.index(loc[0]) for loc in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    # ... rest of the code remains unchanged
```

With this fix, the `_unstack_multiple` function should be able to properly handle the unstacking of Series using tuple names as the level index.
