The error occurs when the test case attempts to unstack a MultiIndex DataFrame using the column names 'A' and 'a' as the indices. The buggy function is `_unstack_multiple` which is attempting to get the level number of certain indices and is failing to do so.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle hierarchical columns properly and is not able to retrieve the level number for the given indices.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to properly handle hierarchical columns and retrieve the level number for the provided indices.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    if len(index.levels) > 1:
        # Handling hierarchical columns
        clocs = [cloc if isinstance(cloc, tuple) else (cloc,) for cloc in clocs]
        clocs = [index.get_loc(cloc) for cloc in clocs]
    else:
        # Single level index
        clocs = [index.get_loc(cloc) for cloc in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # ... rest of the code remains unchanged ...
```

In the corrected code, we added handling for hierarchical columns by checking the length of index levels. If the length is greater than 1, we assume it is a hierarchical column and convert `clocs` to a list of tuples if they are not already tuples. Then we get the location of the indices using `index.get_loc` for both hierarchical and single-level indices.
