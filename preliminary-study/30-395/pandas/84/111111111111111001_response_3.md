The bug occurs in the `_unstack_multiple` function, specifically when trying to get the level number using `index._get_level_number`. The error message indicates that the level 'A' is not found in the list of names, resulting in a KeyError.

This error occurs because the input `clocs` for the `index._get_level_number` is expected to be a list of level numbers, but it is being passed the tuple `('A', 'a')`. This mismatch in input types causes the error.

To fix this bug, the function should properly handle the input types and convert the tuple `('A', 'a')` into the corresponding level numbers before passing it to the `index._get_level_number` method.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Convert tuple clocs into the corresponding level numbers
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    # ... (rest of the code remains the same)
```

With this correction, the function will handle both level numbers and level name tuples correctly, thus eliminating the KeyError and resolving the bug.
