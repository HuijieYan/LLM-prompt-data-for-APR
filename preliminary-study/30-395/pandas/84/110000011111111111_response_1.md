## Analyzing the issue

The error occurs in the `_get_level_number` method of the `MultiIndex` class. It seems that the `index._get_level_number` method is unable to handle tuple names in multi-index while unstacking.

The error occurs due to the fact that the names of the levels are stored in a tuple, and the `index._get_level_number` method does not handle tuple names properly.

## Error Location

The error is occurring in the `_get_level_number` method of the `MultiIndex` class.

## Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug

The `_get_level_number` method does not handle tuple names properly, leading to the KeyError in the unstacking process when the tuple names are provided.

## Possible approaches for fixing the bug

The `_get_level_number` method needs to be updated to handle tuple names properly. It should be able to handle both single level names and tuple level names in the multi-index.

## The corrected code

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    if all(isinstance(cloc, tuple) for cloc in clocs):
        new_cloc_ids = [tuple(index.names).index(cloc) for cloc in clocs]
    else:
        new_cloc_ids = [index._get_level_number(cloc) for cloc in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in new_cloc_ids]

    # Other parts of the function remain the same
```

In this corrected code, we've added a conditional check to see if all the `clocs` are tuples. If they are, we fetch the index of each tuple name, otherwise, we directly get the level number. This approach allows the function to handle both single level names and tuple level names in the multi-index. Now the `_unstack_multiple` function should be able to handle tuple names in multi-index during unstacking.

This corrected code should resolve the KeyError issue and properly handle tuple names in the multi-index during unstacking.
