Potential error location: The bug seems to be located in the logic for handling multidimensional indices when unstacking the data.

Reason for the bug:
- The bug appears to be related to how the function is handling the different levels of the MultiIndex. When unstacking the data, the function needs to appropriately handle the different levels and properly reconstruct the index.
- The bug might be happening due to incorrect manipulation of the index levels, codes, and names, leading to an incorrect result.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Ensure that the function appropriately handles all levels of the MultiIndex when unstacking the data.
- Verify that the reconstruction of the index after unstacking is done properly for the expected DataFrame structure.
- Validate the logic for handling hierarchical columns in the MultiIndex to ensure correct unstacking.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import pandas as pd

def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract and unstack the MultiIndex
    unstacked = data.unstack(level=clocs)
    
    return unstacked
```
This corrected code simplifies the logic by using the built-in `unstack` method of the DataFrame to unstack the MultiIndex. It handles the unstacking based on the level specified in `clocs` and returns the unstacked DataFrame.
