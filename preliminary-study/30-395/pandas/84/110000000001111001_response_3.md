The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function seems to originate from the handling of the `clocs` variable, which represents the column locations. It is being checked if the length of `clocs` is zero, but we can see from the input parameter value and type that `clocs` is actually a tuple or a nested tuple, not a list. This is causing the bug because the function is treating `clocs` as a list.

This error results in issues further down in the function, such as using the wrong indices and failing to create the desired `dummy_index`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to handle `clocs` properly as a tuple. Then we should also verify and correct any errors in the code that use `clocs` as a list.

The corrected function would look like this:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    # Convert clocs to a list
    clocs = list(clocs)

    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...

    return unstacked
```

By ensuring that `clocs` is converted to a list, we prevent errors caused by treating it as a tuple. This approach then allows us to proceed with the rest of the function.
