The potential error in the provided function is that the logic for unstacking multi-index columns is incorrect and could lead to unexpected results.

The bug occurs because the code does not correctly handle hierarchical columns. When "clocs" is not empty, the code attempts to unstack the data based on the column index. However, the code does not appropriately handle the case when the data has hierarchical columns, leading to potential errors or unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, the code needs to be modified to correctly handle hierarchical columns during the unstacking process.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(data, DataFrame):
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    elif isinstance(data, Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(level=clocs[0], fill_value=fill_value)
        unstacked.columns = unstacked.columns.droplevel()

    return unstacked
```

In the corrected code, we check if the input "data" is a DataFrame or a Series, and then use the "unstack" method accordingly to handle the unstacking of the specified levels. This approach ensures that the unstacking of multi-index columns is correctly handled for both DataFrames and Series.
