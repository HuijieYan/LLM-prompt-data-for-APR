The error occurs when the `_get_level_number` method of the `MultiIndex` class is called. This method is used to retrieve the level number of a specified level name. The error message indicates that the level name 'A' is not found in the list of names.

The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is trying to call `_get_level_number` method to get the level numbers of the levels specified in `clocs`. However, the level name 'A' is represented as a tuple within the `clocs` variable, which is causing the error.

To fix this bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function needs to handle the case where a tuple representing a MultiIndex level is provided. It should extract the level name from the tuple and pass it to `_get_level_number` method.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    def get_level_number(level):
        if isinstance(level, tuple):
            level = (level[0],) if len(level) == 1 else level
            level = index.names.index(level)
        else:
            level = index._get_level_number(level)
        return level

    clocs = [get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # (... rest of the code remains unchanged ...)
```

By providing a way to extract the level name from the tuple and then utilize the `_get_level_number` method, we ensure that the function can handle both single-level and multi-level level names, thereby resolving the error.
