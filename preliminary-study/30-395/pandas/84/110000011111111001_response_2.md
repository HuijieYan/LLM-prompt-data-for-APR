The `ValueError` and `KeyError` are occurring in the `_unstack_multiple` function at the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`. This error is happening because the `index._get_level_number` method is not able to handle the tuple input for the `clocs`.

The error is occurring because the `clocs` variable is a tuple, but the `_get_level_number` method is expecting an integer, as it is trying to get the level number based on the name. This results in the TypeError, ValueError, and KeyError.

To fix this, we need to modify the `_get_level_number` method to handle both integer and tuple inputs. The method should check the type of input and if it is a tuple, it should find the levels based on the tuple names. If it is an integer, it should directly return the level number.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # ... previous code ...

    def _get_level_number(index, level):
        if isinstance(level, tuple):
            level_numbers = [index._get_level_number(name) for name in level]
            return tuple(level_numbers)
        elif isinstance(level, int):
            return level
        else:
            raise TypeError("Level should be either tuple of names or integer")

    clocs = [_get_level_number(index, i) for i in clocs]

    # ... rest of the code ...
```

In this corrected code, a new function called `_get_level_number` is defined within the `_unstack_multiple` function. This function checks the type of the input `level` and retrieves the level number accordingly. If the level is a tuple, it finds the level numbers based on the names in the tuple and returns a tuple of level numbers. If the input is an integer, it directly returns the level number.

This modification addresses the issue of the `ValueError` and `KeyError` by handling both tuple and integer inputs for the level numbers.
