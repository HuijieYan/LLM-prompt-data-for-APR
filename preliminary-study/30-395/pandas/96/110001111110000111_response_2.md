The error occurs when using the `pd.date_range()` function with a custom business hour frequency and adding holidays. In this case, instead of producing the expected 14 periods, it produces more than 14 periods, leading to a `ValueError`.

Upon analyzing the code and the error message, it's likely that the issue is within the `apply()` function. The `apply()` function seems to be related to adjusting dates based on business hours, and the bug could be causing the holiday dates to be incorrectly handled.

The reason for the bug could be that the `apply()` function does not handle holidays correctly, leading to an incorrect adjustment of dates when holidays are present. This leads to the incorrect number of periods being generated in the date range.

To fix the bug, the `apply()` function needs to be updated to properly handle holidays while adjusting dates based on business hours.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply()` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):

    # ... (existing code) ...

    # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
    if n >= 0:
        if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            if other in self.holidays:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
    else:
        if other.time() in self.start:
            # adjustment to move to previous business day
            other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
        if not self._is_on_offset(other):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            if other in self.holidays:
                other = self._get_business_hours_start_time(other)

    # ... (remaining code) ...

    return other
```

In the corrected code, the `apply()` function checks if the adjusted date falls on a holiday and handles it accordingly to avoid the issue of generating more periods than expected.

This corrected code should address the issue of `pd.date_range()` not working as expected when using periods and adding holidays with a custom business hour frequency.
