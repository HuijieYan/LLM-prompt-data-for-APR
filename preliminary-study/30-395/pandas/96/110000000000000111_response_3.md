The issue reported on GitHub describes a scenario where using `pd.date_range` with the `periods` parameter and adding holidays leads to more periods than expected. The user provides an example where setting the `holidays` parameter in `pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour` results in unexpected behavior.

Upon analyzing the provided function, the potential error location seems to be within the `apply` method, particularly in the logic for adjusting the business days and remaining business hours.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be related to the handling of holidays in the business hour calculations. It seems that the current implementation does not handle holidays correctly, resulting in the unexpected behavior observed in the test case.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to review the logic for handling holidays within the business hour calculations and ensure that holidays are properly accounted for in the adjustment process.

The corrected code for the `apply` method is as follows:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Handle holidays
        while self.is_on_offset(other) or other.date() in self.holidays:
            other += timedelta(hours=1)
        
        # Rest of the code remains the same
        # ...
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected code, the handling of holidays within the `apply` method has been added. The method now ensures that the given datetime is adjusted to the next business hour, considering any holidays that may affect the calculation. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to unexpected behavior when using holidays with `pd.date_range` and `pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour`.
