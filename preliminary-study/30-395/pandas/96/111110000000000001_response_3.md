Sure, here is the full code of the fixed `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime.datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # rest of the function remains the same
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
