The potential error in the `apply` method is that the decorator `@apply_wraps` is trying to wrap a method, but it is not provided in the given code.

The bug occurred because the `apply` method is decorated with `@apply_wraps` but the `apply_wraps` decorator itself is not provided in the given code. This would cause an error when trying to execute the `apply` method.

To fix this bug, either the `apply_wraps` decorator needs to be defined and provided in the code, or the `@apply_wraps` decorator needs to be removed from the `apply` method.

Given that the `apply_wraps` decorator is not available in the provided code, the simplest fix would be to remove the `@apply_wraps` decorator from the `apply` method. 

Here's the corrected code for the `apply` method:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # ... (rest of the code remains unchanged) ...
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
