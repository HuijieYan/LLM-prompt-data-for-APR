The error message indicates that the `pd.date_range` function is not behaving as expected when using the `periods` parameter and adding holidays when using `CustomBusinessHour` frequency.

The issue seems to be related to how the holiday is being handled in combination with the `periods` parameter.

The bug is likely located in the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class. It seems that the logic for handling holidays and periods in the `apply` function does not work correctly.

To fix the bug, the logic for applying holidays and periods to the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency needs to be revised.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if self.start_time <= other.time() < self.end_time and other.date() not in self.holidays:
            return other

        while other.time() >= self.end_time or other.date() in self.holidays:
            other += self.freq

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected code:
- We first check if the input is a datetime and within business hours and not a holiday. If so, we return the input unchanged.
- Otherwise, we loop through to the next business hour until the datetime is within business hours and not a holiday, and then return it.

This approach should correctly handle the combination of holidays and periods within the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency.
