The bug is likely to be in the `apply` method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class as it is responsible for manipulating the passed `datetime` object based on the business hours and holidays.

The error message indicates that the issue arises from validating the frequency for the `DatetimeIndex` when using the `pd.date_range` function. It seems that when holidays are added, the computed frequency is incorrect, leading to more periods than expected.

The bug is likely due to incorrect manipulation of the datetime object and/or wrong handling of holidays and business hours in the `apply` method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class. This results in an incorrect frequency for the `DatetimeIndex`.

To fix the bug, the `apply` method should be modified to handle the holidays correctly and adjust the frequency accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply` method in the `BusinessHourMixin` class:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# class declaration containing the corrected function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # other methods...

    # this is the corrected function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # handling holidays
            if other.date() in self.holidays:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            
            # business day adjustment
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected method:
- We handle the holidays by adjusting the `other` datetime object to the next opening time if it falls on a holiday.
- We address the business day adjustment by ensuring that the datetime object aligns with the business hours.

By making these adjustments, the `apply` method should now correctly handle holidays and business hours, resulting in a proper frequency for the `DatetimeIndex` when used with `pd.date_range`.
