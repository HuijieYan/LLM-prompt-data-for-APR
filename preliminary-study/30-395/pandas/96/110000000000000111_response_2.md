The issue here seems to be in the `apply` method which is used to adjust datetime objects based on business hours. The bug seems to cause the method to produce incorrect results when dealing with periods that contain holidays.

The potential error location within the `apply` method could be the logic for adjusting the datetime object to business hours and handling holidays.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be incorrect handling of holidays within the logic of the method, causing it to produce unexpected results.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could involve reviewing and updating the logic for handling holidays within the `apply` method. This may include ensuring that the adjustment to business hours correctly accounts for holidays and doesn't result in unexpected behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply` method:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour


def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        freq = CustomBusinessHour(start=self.start, end=self.end, holidays=self.holidays)

        if n >= 0:
            adjusted_time = freq.rollforward(other)
        else:
            adjusted_time = freq.rollback(other)

        return adjusted_time
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
