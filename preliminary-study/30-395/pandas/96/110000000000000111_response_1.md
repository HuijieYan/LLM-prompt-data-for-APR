The error is likely related to the implementation of the `apply` function, which is used to combine business hours and datetime objects, but is not handling holidays correctly.

The bug seems to be occurring because the `apply` function is not adjusting for holidays when calculating the business hours. This results in an incorrect number of periods when using `pd.date_range` with holidays specified.

To fix the bug, the `apply` function needs to be modified to handle holidays properly when calculating business hours. This may involve adjusting the logic for calculating business hours and considering the impact of holidays on the output.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply` function:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessDay
from pandas.tseries.offsets import apply_wraps


@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if isinstance(self, CustomBusinessHour) and self.holidays:
            for holiday in self.holidays:
                if holiday.date() == other.date():
                    raise ApplyHolidayError("Cannot use CustomBusinessHour with specified holidays")

        # rest of the function logic remains unchanged
        # ...

    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected code, we have added a check for specified holidays in the `CustomBusinessHour` and raised an error to handle the situation where a holiday falls on a specified date. This should help ensure that holidays are correctly handled when calculating business hours.
