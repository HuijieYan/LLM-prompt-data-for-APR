The error occurs when using the `pd.date_range` function with the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency and adding holidays. It is causing the date_range function to produce more than the specified number of periods.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `apply` method. The `apply` method takes two datetime objects and adjusts the second one according to the business hours defined by the first datetime object.

The bug occurs because the `apply` method is not handling the holidays properly, which leads to incorrect adjustments of the datetime objects. This is causing the date_range function to produce more periods than expected.

To fix the bug, the `apply` method needs to correctly handle the holidays when adjusting the datetime objects according to the business hours.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply` method:

```python
from datetime import datetime

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Check if other is a holiday
        if other.date() in self.holidays:
            raise ApplyHolidayError("Holiday cannot be used in business hours")
        else:
            # rest of the method remains the same
            pass
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected code, we first check if the supplied `other` datetime object is a holiday. If it is a holiday, we raise an exception. Otherwise, we proceed with the rest of the method as before. This prevents holidays from interfering with the business hour adjustments.
