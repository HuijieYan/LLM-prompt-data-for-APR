Issue:
The function `_get_grouper` has several conditional statements that check the type of `group_axis` and `level`. If the conditions are met, the values of `level` and `key` are modified. However, there are issues with the conditions and the subsequent modifications to `level` and `key`.

Reason for the bug:
When the function encounters certain conditions related to `group_axis` being a `MultiIndex`, it attempts to modify the `level` and `key` values based on the condition. However, the modifications made to `level` and `key` are not consistently applied and may lead to unexpected outcomes.

Proposed approach:
1. Write clear and concise conditional statements to handle the different cases involving `group_axis` and `level`.
2. Ensure that the modifications made to `level` and `key` are consistent and valid in all cases.

To fix the bug, we should rewrite the conditional statements and ensure that the modifications to `level` and `key` align with the expected outcomes.

# Fixed function
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,

    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis,level,sort, while
    the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps
