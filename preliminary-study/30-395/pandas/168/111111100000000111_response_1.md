The issue here is that when trying to group by columns with the `groupby` function, it results in a `KeyError` even though the intent is to group by the column labels.

It seems that the issue lies within the `_get_grouper` function, specifically in the logic that handles the grouping by columns. The code is not correctly identifying that the intent is to group by the column labels.

The potential reason behind the bug is that the code is not handling the grouping by columns properly. It is not correctly identifying the column labels when attempting to group by the columns.

To fix this bug, the logic for handling the grouping by columns needs to be revised. The code should correctly identify and handle the grouping by column labels.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
# corrected _get_grouper function
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (existing code) ...

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if axis == 1:
        if key is None:
            keys = [col for col in group_axis]
        else:
            keys = [key]

        groupings = []

        for col in keys:
            gpr = obj[col]
            ping = (
                Grouping(
                    group_axis,
                    gpr,
                    obj=obj,
                    name=col,
                    level=level,
                    sort=sort,
                    observed=observed,
                    in_axis=True,
                )
            )
            groupings.append(ping)

        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        return grouper, [], obj

    # ... (existing code) ...
```

In the corrected code, we've added a condition to check if the `axis` is 1 (indicating grouping by columns). If so, we create a `Grouping` object for each column and add it to the `groupings` list. Then we create the `BaseGrouper` and return it as the result.

This should address the issue and allow for correct grouping by columns in the `groupby` function when `axis=1`.
