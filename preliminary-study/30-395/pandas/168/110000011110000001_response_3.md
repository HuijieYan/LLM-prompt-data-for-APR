After analyzing the test case and the error message, it is evident that the issue is occurring within the `_get_grouper` function. The error occurs when attempting to group the DataFrame by the column 'x' using the 'group_name' parameter provided in the test function.

The bug is occurring in the section where it checks for the level and key parameters. The verification of the level and key is not handling the case where 'group_name' is a list. It is treating the list 'group_name' as a single key instead of a list of keys.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic that handles the 'level' and 'key' parameters to properly deal with the case where 'group_name' is a list.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (other parts of the function remain the same)

    # Check if key is a list, then validate each key
    if isinstance(key, list):
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

        for k in keys:
            if k not in group_axis:
                raise KeyError(k)

    # ... (remaining logic of the function stays the same)
```

With this correction, the `_get_grouper` function will properly handle the case where 'group_name' is a list of keys. It will iterate through each key in the list and validate its presence in the group axis before proceeding with the grouping operation.
