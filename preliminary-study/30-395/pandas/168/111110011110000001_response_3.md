The test case `test_groupby_axis_1` is intended to group the DataFrame `df` by the column name "x" using `df.groupby(group_name, axis=1).sum()`. The test is failing with a `KeyError: 'x'` which means the "x" column is not being recognized as a valid key for grouping.

The potential error location within the `_get_grouper` function is between lines 131 and 133, where the key for grouping is being processed. It seems that the function is not handling the case where the `key` parameter is a list correctly or the logic for handling lists as keys might be incorrect.

The bug occurs because the code is not handling a list of keys correctly. It's assuming that the `key` can be a list and trying to perform operations with the list, but it doesn't consider that the items inside the list should be processed differently.

To fix the bug, the `_get_grouper` function can be updated to properly handle the case when the `key` parameter is a list. We can modify the logic in the function to correctly handle lists as keys for grouping.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # existing logic...

    if isinstance(key, list):
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

        any_callable = any(callable(g) or isinstance(g, dict) for g in keys)
        any_groupers = any(isinstance(g, Grouper) for g in keys)
        any_arraylike = any(
            isinstance(g, (list, tuple, Series, Index, np.ndarray)) for g in keys
        )

        if (
            not any_callable
            and not any_arraylike
            and not any_groupers
            and match_axis_length
            and level is None
        ):
            # Updated logic to handle lists as keys
            if isinstance(obj, DataFrame):
                all_in_columns_index = all(
                    g in obj.columns or g in obj.index.names for g in keys
                )
            elif isinstance(obj, Series):
                all_in_columns_index = all(g in obj.index.names for g in keys)

            if not all_in_columns_index:
                # Convert keys to array-safe tuples
                keys = [com.asarray_tuplesafe(keys)]

        levels = [level] * len(keys)

        # Grouping creation logic...
        
    # remaining logic...
```

With this updated code, the `_get_grouper` function should be able to handle a list of keys correctly for grouping the DataFrame. This modification addresses the bug related to handling multiple keys provided as a list.
