The error occurs when trying to group by columns using the `groupby` method with the `axis=1` argument. Instead of grouping by the columns, it raises a KeyError. This behavior is unexpected and not in line with the documentation, which suggests that "A str or list of strs may be passed to group by the columns in self".

The potential error location within the `_get_grouper` function could be in the section where the function checks if `is_in_axis` to determine if the grouper is in the axis. This check seems to be problematic and may be causing the KeyError.

One approach to fixing this bug is to carefully review the logic in the `_get_grouper` function to ensure that the axis and the grouping by columns are handled correctly. It may involve identifying and correcting the conditions and checks related to grouping by columns. Additionally, testing the function with different input configurations to cover various scenarios would help ensure that the logic is correct.

Another approach is to use the `groupby` method with the `axis=1` argument directly, as it is the recommended approach for grouping by columns. This avoids the usage of the internal `_get_grouper` function and can help bypass the potential bug.

Here's the corrected function/method based on the analysis:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    if axis == 1:
        return key, [], obj
    else:
        group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)
        # The rest of the function logic for axis 0
        # ...

    # ... (rest of the function logic)

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

In this corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function, we explicitly handle the case when `axis` is 1 and return the `key` and empty lists for exclusions, as it is not necessary to go through the internal logic for grouping by columns. For a grouping by index, the original internal logic can be used as before.
