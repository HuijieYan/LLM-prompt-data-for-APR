The potential error location within the problematic function is when identifying whether a key is in the axis or the object. This is done using the `is_in_axis` and `is_in_obj` functions. 

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `is_in_axis` and `is_in_obj` functions are not working as expected and could potentially return incorrect results.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to review and refactor the `is_in_axis` and `is_in_obj` functions to ensure they correctly identify whether a key is in the axis or the object.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (omitted code) ...
    
    def is_in_axis(key):
        if not _is_label_like(key):
            if key in obj:
                return True
            else:
                return False
        else:
            return True

    def is_in_obj(gpr):
        if isinstance(gpr, str) and gpr in obj:
            return id(gpr) == id(obj[gpr])
        else:
            return False
    
    # (remaining code remains the same) ...
```
In the corrected version of the function, the `is_in_axis` function checks whether the key is in the object, and the `is_in_obj` function checks if the element is in the object and is the same as the original object.

These corrections improve the accuracy of checking whether a key is in the axis or the object.
