The error occurs in the `_get_grouper` function, specifically when it tries to handle grouping by column names. The loop within the function assumes that the keys are labels from either the index or the columns, but it does not handle the case of grouping by column names.

The issue occurs because the function does not handle the scenario when grouping has to be done by column names explicitly. It currently assumes that the keys are labels from either the index or the columns, but it does not handle the case of grouping by column names when the `axis` parameter is set to 1.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to handle the case of grouping by column names when the `axis` parameter is set to 1. This can be achieved by modifying the logic within the function to handle the grouping correctly based on the specified `axis` parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (existing code)

    # If 'key' is None and 'axis' is 1, create the Grouper based on column names
    if key is None and axis == 1:
        key = obj.columns

    # ... (remaining code)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

By adding the condition to create the Grouper based on column names when the `key` is None and the `axis` is 1, the function will correctly handle grouping by column names. This modification ensures that the function properly handles the scenario when grouping is to be performed on the columns instead of the index.
