The bug is likely located in the `_get_grouper` function within the provided source code. The error message suggests that grouping along columns using the 'x' column name is not working as expected and is raising a KeyError.

The bug is occurring because the function is not handling the grouping by columns correctly. It seems that the logic for identifying the columns is flawed and may be causing the KeyError.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_grouper` should be updated to correctly handle grouping by column names. This may involve adjusting the logic for identifying and handling the column names within the function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    if axis == 1 and key is not None and isinstance(key, str):
        if key in obj.columns:
            gpr = key
            group_axis = obj.columns
            in_axis, name, gpr = True, gpr, obj[gpr]
            exclusions = [name]
            ping = Grouping(
                group_axis,
                gpr,
                obj=obj,
                name=name,
                level=level,
                sort=sort,
                observed=observed,
                in_axis=in_axis,
            )
            grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, [ping], sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
            return grouper, exclusions, obj
        else:
            raise KeyError(key)

    # ... existing logic for other cases ...

```

In the corrected version, if the `axis` is 1 and the `key` is a string (indicating a column name), the function checks if the key is present in the columns of the DataFrame. If it is, it creates a grouping based on the column name and returns the grouper.

This fix should address the issue of grouping along columns using column names and avoid the KeyError that was being raised in the previous version of the function.
