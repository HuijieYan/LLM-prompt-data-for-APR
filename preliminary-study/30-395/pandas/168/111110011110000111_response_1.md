The error occurs in the `_get_grouper` function where the KeyError is being raised. This happens because when grouping by columns, the function `groupby` should accept the column name(s) as the `by` argument, but it doesn't handle this correctly.

To fix this bug, the `_get_grouper` function should be modified to properly handle the grouping by columns. This involves identifying the column names and processing them accordingly.

One approach to fix this bug is to modify the logic for handling grouping by columns in the `_get_grouper` function. Specifically, when grouping by columns, the function should properly identify the column names and create groupings based on those names.

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    (previous docstring remains the same)
    """

    # ... (existing code)

    # modify the logic to handle grouping by columns
    if key is not None and isinstance(key, str):
        # Check if key is a single column name
        if key in obj.columns:
            key = obj[key].values
        else:
            raise KeyError(key)

        groupings = [Grouping(obj, key, name=key)]

        # create the internals grouper
        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        return grouper, [], obj

    # ... (existing code)
```

This modified code will correctly handle the case where the `key` is a string representing a column name. It creates the appropriate groupings based on the column names and then returns the grouper.

With this fix, the issue reported in the GitHub issue "GroupBy(axis=1) Does Not Offer Implicit Selection By Columns Name(s)" should be resolved.

The corrected code for the `_get_grouper` function with the fix implemented is as follows. This resolves the issue where the `groupby` was not correctly handling grouping by column names:

```python
# Corrected and modified _get_grouper function to fix the bug
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    (previous docstring remains the same)
    """

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # modify the logic to handle grouping by columns
    if key is not None and isinstance(key, str):
        # Check if key is a single column name
        if key in obj.columns:
            key = obj[key].values
        else:
            raise KeyError(key)

        groupings = [Grouping(obj, key, name=key)]

        # create the internals grouper
        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        return grouper, [], obj

    # ... (remaining existing code)
```
