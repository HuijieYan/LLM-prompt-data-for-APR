The function `_get_grouper` is intended to create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal mapping to create the grouper indexers. The function tries to determine references passed in and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into a BaseGrouper.

Upon analyzing the input and expected output, it seems that the issue may be related to the use of the `key` parameter. In the provided input, the `key` is being passed as a list `['x']`, but the function is treating it as a single key. 

To address the issue, the following steps can be taken:
1. Check the handling of the `key` parameter in the function.
2. Determine the appropriate way to handle a list of keys.
3. Ensure that the function processes each key in the list appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (previous code)

    # a passed-in Grouper, directly convert
    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj

    # already have a BaseGrouper, just return it
    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj

    # handle the case when key is a list
    elif isinstance(key, list):
        groupers = []
        exclusions = []

        for k in key:
            # perform processing for each individual key
            if isinstance(k, Grouper):
                binner, grouper, obj = k._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
                if k.key is None:
                    groupers.append(grouper)
                else:
                    groupers.append(grouper)
                    exclusions.append(k.key)

        # create the internals grouper
        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

In the corrected code, we explicitly handle the case when `key` is a list. We iterate through each item in the list and process it accordingly to create the necessary groupers. After processing all the keys, we create and return the BaseGrouper using the groupings obtained from the list of keys.
