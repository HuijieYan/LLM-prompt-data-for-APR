The error occurs when the test case is trying to use the `groupby` method of a DataFrame with `group_name` as the column axis. 

The bug seems to be originating from the `_get_grouper` function, which is responsible for creating and returning a `BaseGrouper`, an internal mapping of how to create the group indexers.

The error occurs when the `raise KeyError(gpr)` statement is triggered. This happens when the input `gpr` is not found in the `obj` DataFrame. In this case, the input `gpr` is 'x' when using `axis=1` and `['x']` as the `group_name`. Since 'x' is a valid column name, it suggests that the function is unable to handle the single string input correctly when it's passed in a list. 

To fix this, the function should be modified to handle single string input correctly when passed in a list and avoid raising a `KeyError`.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis,level,sort, while
    the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed values

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps

    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)

    if isinstance(key, list) and len(key) == 1:  # Handle the case where key is single string in a list
        key = key[0]

    # ... (remaining part of the function remains unchanged)
```

This correction ensures that when a single string is passed in a list, it is correctly handled as a single string.
