Potential error location: The problematic code seems to be related to the `Grouping` creation within the `_get_grouper` function.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug seems to be occurring due to incorrect handling of grouping by columns using the `by` argument with `axis=1`. This is causing a KeyError when attempting to group by column names.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Identify the location in the code where the `KeyError` is being raised and examine the logic around it to determine where the issue lies.
2. Make sure that the function properly handles grouping by columns when `axis=1` is specified.
3. Check for any areas in the code that may be incorrectly assuming that the `by` argument refers to the index when `axis=0`, and modify the logic to account for the axis value.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    by=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    ...

    """
    if axis == 0:
        group_axis = obj.index
    else:
        group_axis = obj.columns

    grouper, exclusions, obj = ...

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```
