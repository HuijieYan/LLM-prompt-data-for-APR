The bug in the given function is due to the block of code that manipulates the `level` parameter when it is not None. The logic for handling `level` seems to be overly complex and convoluted, leading to potential issues. This involves extensive processing and conditional statements which can be simplified to improve readability and reduce the chance of introducing errors.

The potential error location in the code is within the block that handles the `level` parameter, specifically in the nested if-else conditions and the subsequent operations involving `group_axis` and `key`.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug are:
1. Complex conditional logic: The conditional statements for handling `level` are convoluted, making it hard to follow the execution flow and increasing the likelihood of errors.
2. Lack of clarity: The logic for processing the `level` parameter is not well-documented, which makes it difficult for developers to understand and maintain the code.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling the `level` parameter can be simplified and streamlined. This will involve removing unnecessary nested conditional statements and ensuring that the code is more concise and easier to understand.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Existing problematic function code

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            # Simplified logic for MultiIndex handling
            level, key = _handle_multiindex_level(level, key, group_axis)
        else:
            if isinstance(level, list):
                # Simplified handling for list-like level objects
                level, key = _handle_list_like_level(level, key, obj)

    # Continuing with the rest of the function code...

def _handle_multiindex_level(level, key, group_axis):
    if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
        level = level[0]
    if key is None and is_scalar(level):
        key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
        level = None
    return level, key

def _handle_list_like_level(level, key, obj):
    nlevels = len(level)
    if nlevels == 1:
        level = level[0]
    elif nlevels == 0:
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
    else:
        raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

    if isinstance(level, str):
        if obj.index.name != level:
            raise ValueError("level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level))
    elif level > 0 or level < -1:
        raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

    level = None
    key = group_axis
    return level, key
```

In the corrected code, the logic specific to handling `level` has been moved to two separate functions to simplify the main logic of the `_get_grouper` function. This makes the code easier to read, understand, and maintain. Additionally, the conditional handling of `level` for both MultiIndex and non-MultiIndex cases has been streamlined, reducing the potential for errors.
