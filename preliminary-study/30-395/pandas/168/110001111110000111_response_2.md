The error occurs in the `_get_grouper` method, specifically in the section that tries to determine whether the passed key is a valid column label for grouping. The bug arises because it doesn't handle the case where the key is a column label appropriately. The function tries to handle different types of keys, including cases where the key is a `Grouper` or a `BaseGrouper`, but it fails to accurately process a simple column label.

To fix the bug, the function should first check if the key is a valid column label and then proceed with the grouping based on the columns if it is. This can be achieved through a conditional check and ensuring that appropriate exceptions are raised if an invalid label is provided.

Here's the corrected `_get_grouper` method:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)
    
    # other parts of the function remain unchanged
    
    # check if the key is a valid column label
    if not isinstance(key, (Grouper, BaseGrouper)) and isinstance(key, str) and key in obj.columns:
        name = key
        gpr = obj[key]
        exclusions.append(name)
        in_axis = True
    else:
        raise KeyError(key)
    
    # other parts of the function remain unchanged
```

With this modification, the `_get_grouper` method can now properly handle the case where the key is a valid column label, avoiding the KeyError that was previously raised. This should resolve the issue and allow the test case to execute successfully.
