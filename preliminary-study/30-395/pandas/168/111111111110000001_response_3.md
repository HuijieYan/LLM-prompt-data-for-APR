The error occurs when calling the `groupby` method with a multi-index DataFrame and passing a list of column names as `group_name`. This leads to the execution of the `_get_grouper` function with incorrect input, resulting in a `KeyError` due to the mishandling of the `key` parameter.

The potential error location within the `_get_grouper` function is the processing of the `key` parameter. Initially, the function expects `key` to be a single key or list-like object, but the provided test case passes a list of column names as `group_name`.

To fix this bug, it's necessary to modify the `_get_grouper` function to handle the case where `key` is a list-like object, such as a list of column names in the context of a multi-index DataFrame.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... existing code ...

    if isinstance(key, (list, tuple)):
        keys = key
    else:
        keys = [key]

    # logic for handling list-like objects
    # iterate through each key in the list
    for k in keys:
        if k not in obj:
            raise KeyError(k)

    match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

In the corrected function, the `key` parameter is checked for being a list or tuple. If it is, each key is iterated through to ensure it exists in the DataFrame. This approach addresses the issue and ensures that the `_get_grouper` function can handle a list of column names as input when dealing with a multi-index DataFrame.
