The issue seems to lie in the `_get_grouper` function. When the `axis` parameter is 1 and the `key` is a list, the function does not handle this case correctly. It should group by columns based on the values in the `key` list.

The bug occurs because the function does not properly interpret the `key` input when it is a list. It should iterate through the elements in the list and perform the grouping by each column name.

To fix the bug, you can modify the logic inside the `_get_grouper` function to handle the case where the `axis` is 1 and the `key` is a list. It should iterate through the elements in the list and perform the grouping by each column name.

Here's the corrected function for the `_get_grouper`:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    if axis == 1 and isinstance(key, list):
        groupings = []
        exclusions = []
        
        for k in key:
            if k in obj.columns:
                ping = Grouping(
                    obj._get_axis(1),
                    k,
                    obj=obj,
                    name=k,
                    level=level,
                    sort=sort,
                    observed=observed,
                    in_axis=True,
                )
                groupings.append(ping)
                exclusions.append(k)
        
        grouper = BaseGrouper(obj._get_axis(1), groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        return grouper, exclusions, obj
    
    # ... (other cases)
```

This modification checks if the `axis` is 1 and the `key` is a list. If so, it iterates through the elements in the list and performs the grouping by each column name. Then, it creates the `grouper` and returns the result.

This corrected function should now correctly handle the case where `axis` is 1 and `key` is a list, allowing for grouping by multiple columns.
