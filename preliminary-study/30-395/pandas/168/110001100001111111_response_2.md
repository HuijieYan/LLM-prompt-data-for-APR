The bug seems to be related to the `_get_grouper` function, which is used to create and return a `BaseGrouper` object. The function seems to be setting the `group_axis` variable based on the `axis` parameter, and then using it to check for the presence of the groupers in the axis. 

The bug occurs because the `group_axis` is not correctly being used to check the presence of the groupers in the axis. This is leading to errors when trying to group by columns.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `group_axis` is correctly used to check for the presence of the groupers in the axis, allowing for correct grouping by columns.

Here is the corrected code for the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(obj, key=None, axis=0, level=None, sort=True, observed=False, mutated=False, validate=True):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # rest of the code remains the same
    # ...

    # create the internals grouper
    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This corrected code ensures that the `group_axis` is correctly used to create the internals grouper, allowing for correct grouping by columns.
