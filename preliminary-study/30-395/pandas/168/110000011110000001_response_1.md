The error is occurring in the `_get_grouper` function. It seems that the error is related to handling the `level` input parameter and its interaction with the `group_axis`.

Looking at the error messages from the test function, it appears that the issue arises when a list of columns `group_name = ['x']` is passed to the `df.groupby` function. The function `_get_grouper` is having trouble handling this input.

The bug seems to be related to how the function is processing the `level` and `key` parameters, especially when dealing with a MultiIndex. The logic around checking for `is_list_like(level)` and processing it accordingly seems to be causing the issue.

To fix the bug, the `_get_grouper` function should be updated to handle a list of column names when provided as the `group_name` parameter. The logic for processing the `level` parameter also needs to be corrected to handle MultiIndex and non-MultiIndex cases properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(obj, key=None, axis=0, level=None, sort=True, observed=False, mutated=False, validate=True):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
        if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
            level = level[0]

        if key is None and is_scalar(level):
            key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
            level = None
    else:
        if is_list_like(level):
            nlevels = len(level)
            if nlevels == 1:
                level = level[0]
            elif nlevels == 0:
                raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
            else:
                raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

        if isinstance(level, str):
            if obj.index.name != level:
                raise ValueError("level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level))
        elif level > 0 or level < -1:
            raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

        level = None
        key = group_axis

    # rest of the function remains the same
```

It's important to note that this is a partial correction, and the `_get_grouper` function might require further adjustments based on its usage throughout the codebase.
