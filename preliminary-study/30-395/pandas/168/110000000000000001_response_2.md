The potential error location within the provided function is the handling of the `level` parameter and its interaction with `group_axis`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code is trying to handle different cases for the `level` parameter, including cases specific to `MultiIndex` and non-`MultiIndex` objects. However, the handling of these cases is not consistent and may lead to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, it's important to ensure that the `level` parameter is handled consistently for both `MultiIndex` and non-`MultiIndex` objects. This can be achieved by restructuring the conditional statements and improving the logic for handling the `level` parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        # Handle cases for MultiIndex and non-MultiIndex objects consistently
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]
            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")
            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        "level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
                    )
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")
            level = None
            key = group_axis

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

In the corrected code, the conditional statements for handling the `level` parameter have been restructured to ensure consistency in handling both `MultiIndex` and non-`MultiIndex` objects. The logic for handling `level` and `group_axis` has been improved to address the potential bug.
