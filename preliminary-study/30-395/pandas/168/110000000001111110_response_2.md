    Create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis, level, sort, while the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into a BaseGrouper.

    If observed and we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed values

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps
