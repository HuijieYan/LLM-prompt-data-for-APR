Apologies for the confusion, but as an AI language model, I do not have the ability to access or modify files or repositories. I can only provide guidance or suggestions for fixing code based on the information provided.

Given the information you've provided, here's an example of how the corrected `get_indexer` method might look:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise NotImplementedError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # Handle the case when the columns are a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex
        if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex):
            target_as_index = target_as_index.categories

        # Rest of the code remains unchanged
        # ...
```

This example demonstrates how you might modify the `get_indexer` method to handle the specific case when the columns are a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.

Please ensure the code fits into the existing structure of the file and adheres to the coding guidelines of the project.
