The error seems to be occurring in the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class. This method is intended to return an indexer array based on the input target. However, the bug is likely due to the handling of the `target_as_index` variable, which is an `IntervalIndex`. It seems that the method is trying to handle `target_as_index` as if it were a regular index, leading to the TypeError.

The bug occurs because the `get_indexer` method does not properly handle the case when the target index is a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. The method should be updated to handle this specific case and ensure that the rounding operation works as expected.

To fix the bug, the `get_indexer` method should include a specific condition to handle the case when `target_as_index` is a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. This condition should appropriately convert the `CategoricalIndex` back to an `IntervalIndex` before performing the rounding operation.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    # existing code

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, pd.CategoricalIndex):
        target_as_index = pd.IntervalIndex(target_as_index.categories)

    # existing code

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

By adding the specific condition to handle the case of a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`, the function should now correctly handle rounding when such an index is encountered, addressing the bug.
