The potential error in the code is the incorrect use of decorators @Substitution and @Appender.

The bug occurs because the decorator syntax is incorrect. The correct way to use decorators in the provided code is to remove @Substitution and @Appender decorators and pass the necessary arguments directly to the functions or methods, or define them within the function.

Approach for fixing the bug:
1. Remove the @Substitution and @Appender decorators.
2. If the functionality provided by these decorators is still needed, incorporate it directly within the function.

Corrected code:

```python
import textwrap

def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    _index_doc_kwargs = {
        "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
            """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
        )
    }
    _index_shared_docs = {
        "get_indexer": "Some shared documentation for get_indexer"
    }

    self._check_method(method)

    # rest of the code remains the same

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)

```
