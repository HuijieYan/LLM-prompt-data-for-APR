The potential error location within the problematic `get_indexer` function is at the condition `if self.is_overlapping:`. 

The bug occurs because the condition is not comparing the value of `self.is_overlapping` to a boolean, causing the subsequent code within the block to execute even when `is_overlapping` is `False`.

To fix the bug, the condition `if self.is_overlapping:` should be updated to `if self.is_overlapping():` to correctly call the method and compare its returned value to a boolean.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
            Raises
            ------
            NotImplementedError
                If any method argument other than the default of
                None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
            """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    # rest of the code remains unchanged
```
