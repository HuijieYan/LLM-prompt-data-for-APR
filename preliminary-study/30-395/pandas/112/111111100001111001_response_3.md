The potential error in the provided function is likely occurring due to the incorrect usage of the `is_overlapping` attribute. In the buggy function, `self.is_overlapping` is evaluated as a property, but it should be called as a method to retrieve its value. Additionally, the error message suggests that the method `IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique` should be used if overlapping indices are encountered, which is currently not handled in the function.

To fix the bug, the following adjustments need to be made:
1. Call the `is_overlapping` attribute as a method to obtain its value.
2. Handle the case where `is_overlapping` is True and use the `IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique` method in this situation.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)
    
    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = "cannot handle overlapping indices; use IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
    # ...
```
In this corrected code, the `is_overlapping` method is called with parentheses to obtain its value, and the condition is modified to handle the situation when overlapping indices are encountered.
