The error is not explicitly mentioned, but looking at the function, there is a potential bug in the logic related to the `self.is_overlapping` condition. The code checks if `self.is_overlapping` is True or False, but `self.is_overlapping` is a method, not a boolean value. This is likely the cause of the bug as it should be called as a method, not used directly as a boolean.

To fix the bug, the `self.is_overlapping` method should be called to obtain the actual boolean value, and then the logic should be adjusted accordingly.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():  # Call the method to obtain the boolean value
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    # remaining code...
```

In the corrected code, the `self.is_overlapping` method is called with parentheses `()` to obtain the boolean value, and the logic is adjusted accordingly.
