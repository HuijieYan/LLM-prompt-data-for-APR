Based on the provided code and runtime values, it seems that the issue is related to the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class. The `get_indexer` method is used to return an indexer which can be used to index into the input array. However, the implementation seems to have an issue when dealing with a `CategoricalIndex` that is created from an `IntervalIndex`.

The possible reason behind the bug is that the `get_indexer` method is not handling the case where the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex` properly, leading to a TypeError.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `get_indexer` method to handle the case of a `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex` correctly. This may involve updating the logic for handling different index types within the method.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method:

```python
# relative function's signature in this file
def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str]=None, limit: Optional[int]=None, tolerance: Optional[Any]=None) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    # Handle the case when target is a CategoricalIndex created from an IntervalIndex
    if isinstance(target, CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target.categories, IntervalIndex):
        target_as_index = target.categories
    else:
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    # Rest of the method implementation remains unchanged
    # ...
```

In this corrected code, we first check if the target is a `CategoricalIndex` and if its `categories` are of type `IntervalIndex`. If so, we use the `categories` as the `target_as_index`. Otherwise, we continue with the existing logic for `ensure_index(target)`.

This change should address the issue of the `get_indexer` method failing when the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.
