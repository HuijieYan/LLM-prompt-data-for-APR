The problem is likely occurring in the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class. The error message points to a type error, suggesting that there might be an issue with the data types being used in the `get_indexer` method. The `IntervalIndex` and `CategoricalIndex` data types are likely causing a conflict in the `get_indexer` method, leading to the type error.

The bug is likely happening because the `get_indexer` method is not correctly handling the case when the columns are of type `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. This is causing the `round()` method to fail.

To fix this bug, the `get_indexer` method needs to be modified to handle the case when the columns are of type `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. This might involve adding a conditional case within the `get_indexer` method to specifically handle this scenario.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if isinstance(target, pd.CategoricalIndex):
        # Handle the case when the target is a CategoricalIndex
        # made from an IntervalIndex
        target = pd.IntervalIndex(target)
    
    # Rest of the method remains the same
    # ...
```

This modification ensures that if the target is a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`, it will be converted back to an `IntervalIndex` before the `get_indexer` method proceeds with its logic. This should allow the `round()` method to work as expected even when the columns are of type `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.
