The bug is likely occurring because the function `_get_with` is treating different types of indexers differently. The issue is specifically related to the case when a list indexer is used, and the function is not handling it properly.

The reason for the bug is that the function `_get_with` is inconsistently handling different types of indexers, which leads to unexpected behavior. The error message indicates that when a list indexer is used, it raises a KeyError, which is not the expected behavior.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` should be modified to handle all types of indexers consistently. It should also address the specific case of list indexers and ensure that it does not raise a KeyError.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected code, the function now tries to use `self.loc[key]` and if it raises a KeyError, it falls back to `self.reindex(key)`. This modification ensures that the function handles all types of indexers consistently and does not raise unexpected errors.
