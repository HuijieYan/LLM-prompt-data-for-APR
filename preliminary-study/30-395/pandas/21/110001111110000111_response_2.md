The error message indicates that the test is failing because the function is not raising the expected `KeyError` when using a list as the key. The issue seems to be related to the handling of different types of indexers in the `_get_with` method.

The potential error location within the `_get_with` method is likely in the section that handles list-like indexers.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the method is inconsistently handling different types of indexers. It seems that the method is not treating list indexers the same way it treats other array-like indexers, leading to the unexpected behavior observed in the test cases.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could be to ensure that all types of indexers are handled consistently within the `_get_with` method. This may involve updating the conditional statements and the corresponding actions for each type of indexer to ensure uniform behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handling list-like indexers consistently with other array-like indexers
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By handling all types of indexers consistently within the `_get_with` method, the issues observed in the test cases should be resolved.
