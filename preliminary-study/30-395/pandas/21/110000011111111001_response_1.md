The error occurs in the `test_getitem_no_matches` function, where it expects an error to be raised when using a specific key to index a Series. The error message indicates that the KeyError was not raised as expected.

The potential error location within the `test_getitem_no_matches` function is the line that tries to index the Series with the specified key: `ser[key]`.

The bug in the provided function `_get_with` is that it does not handle the case of a key that is not found in the index properly, leading to the KeyError not being raised when it should.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should include a check to verify if the key is not present in the index, and then raise a KeyError in such cases.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    if key not in self.index:
        raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in the index")

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle cases where the key is not found in the index and raise a KeyError as expected in the test cases.
