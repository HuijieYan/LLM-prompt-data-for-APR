The error occurs due to a mismatch between the expected behavior of the function and the actual behavior inferred from the test case. The function is failing to raise a KeyError as expected in the test case.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of different types of keys. There are multiple conditions and checks for the type of key, such as lists, ndarrays, Index, and Series. However, the handling of these different types of keys seems to be inconsistent or incomplete in the current function implementation.

The function is failing to handle the input key and therefore not raising the KeyError as expected in the test case. This suggests that the function is not correctly identifying or processing the input key in certain cases.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to revisit the key handling logic in the function. There should be consistent and complete handling for different types of keys to ensure that the function behaves as expected for all valid input types.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ("integer", "string"):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that all valid input types for the key are handled appropriately, and the function should behave as expected based on the given test case.
