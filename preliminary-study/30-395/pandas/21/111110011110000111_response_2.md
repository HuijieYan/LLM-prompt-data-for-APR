The error occurs when the `ser[key]` operation is performed with a list `key`. This causes the `KeyError` to be raised, indicating that the index values in the list are not found in the index of the Series.

The potential error location within the `buggy` function is the handling of the `list` type key. The code doesn't correctly handle list-like keys, which results in the `KeyError` being raised when using a list as a key.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function does not handle list-like keys in a consistent manner compared to other types of indexers. This inconsistency leads to unexpected errors when using a list as a key.

To fix the bug, the function should handle list-like keys in a consistent manner and ensure that the index values are properly checked and retrieved.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        key_type = lib.check(NumbaConversion(key), r"key", (ExtensionArray,))
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the above changes, the function now handles list-like keys consistently and ensures that the index values are properly retrieved. This should resolve the issue with the test case and the `KeyError` that was being raised.
