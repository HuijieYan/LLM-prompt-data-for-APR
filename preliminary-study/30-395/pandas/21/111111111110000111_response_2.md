The error occurs when trying to index a Series with a list, numpy array, or a pandas Index or Series, and the key has no matches in the index. The error message indicates that there is inconsistency in the behavior of how the different indexers are handled.

The potential error location within the `_get_with` function is in the section that handles the different types of indexers. The bug arises from the inconsistent behavior when using list indexers to access a Series. This inconsistency leads to the inconsistent handling of the KeyError and the inconsistent behavior when using `ser[key]`.

To fix the bug, the handling of the different types of indexers needs to be made consistent. It seems reasonable to make the behavior of using list indexers consistent with the behavior of other indexers.

The corrected code for the problematic function `_get_with` is as follows:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        # Handle list-like indexers consistently
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This modification ensures that all types of indexers are handled consistently, avoiding the inconsistencies observed in the initial implementation.
