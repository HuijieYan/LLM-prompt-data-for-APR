The issue here seems to be related to the way list indexers are handled differently from other array-like indexers in the `_get_with` method of the `Series` class.

First, the difference in behavior is demonstrated with the following examples:
- `ser[key]` and `ser[pd.Index(key)]` both return NaN for a key "C" which is not found in the Series index.
- `ser[np.array(key)]` also returns NaN for the same key "C".
- However, when using `ser[list(key)]`, a KeyError is raised stating that "None of ['C'] are in the [index]".

Upon further investigation, it appears that the issue results from the handling of list indexers in a different way than other array-like indexers in the `_get_with` method. This inconsistency leads to the KeyError when using a list indexer.

One potential approach for fixing this issue would be to unify the handling of list indexers and other array-like indexers in the `_get_with` method. This could involve modifying the logic to handle list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` method:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (slice, ABCDataFrame, tuple)):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        key = np.asarray(key)
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected code, we handle all array-like indexers uniformly by using `np.asarray(key)` to translate any array-like indexer into a NumPy array, and then call `reindex` with that translated key. This approach ensures consistent handling of different types of indexers and resolves the inconsistency observed in the original code.
