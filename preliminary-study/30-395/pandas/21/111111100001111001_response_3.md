The problem occurs in the `_get_with` function when checking the type of the `key` parameter. The function checks for various conditions and decides whether to return using `self.loc` or `self.iloc`, based on the type of `key`. 

One issue is that the expected and actual situation seem to have reversed. The expected type of `key_type` is "string", but it actually has the value "integer". 

The cause of the issue could be the type of the `key`. It seems that in the buggy cases, the type of `key` is determined to be "integer" incorrectly when all the test cases provided expect it to be "string". This is why the conditions used in the function are not being met as expected.

To fix the bug, we should first check the actual type of `key` and revise the conditions and the logic accordingly.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check the actual type of the key
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if key is not None and key.ndim == 0 and key.dtype.type is np.bool_:
        key_type = "boolean"
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        key_type = "string"
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "string":
        return self.loc[key]
    elif key_type == "integer":
        return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```
