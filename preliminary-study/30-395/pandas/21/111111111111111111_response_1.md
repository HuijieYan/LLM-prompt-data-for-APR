The issue arises when trying to index a Series with a list that contains no matches. The current behavior is inconsistent across different types of indexers (list, array-like, pd.Index, pd.Series), and it also leads to unexpected errors.

The problematic function in this case is the `_get_with` method of the `Series` class. The reason behind the bug is that when indexing with a list, it doesn't check for matches and directly attempts to perform the reindex operation, resulting in an error if there are no matches. This behavior is inconsistent with other types of indexers.

To fix this bug, the `_get_with` method should handle the case of indexing with a list in the same way it handles other types of indexers, by first checking for matches before performing the reindex operation. This will ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` method:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    matches = self.index.isin(key)
    if not any(matches):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected code ensures that before performing the reindex operation, it checks for matches and raises a KeyError if there are no matches. This will provide consistent behavior across different types of indexers and prevent unexpected errors.
