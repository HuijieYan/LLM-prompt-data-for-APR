The potential error in the `_get_with` function lies in the handling of different types of keys and the conditional flow for each type. The function is trying to handle different types of keys like slice, DataFrame, tuple, scalar, list, etc., but the conditional flow and type checking are not implemented correctly. This can lead to incorrect handling of the keys and result in unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, a more systematic approach to handling different types of keys is needed. It would be better to use a series of `if-elif` conditions to check the type of the key and then handle it accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        if isinstance(key, (np.integer, int, np.bool_)):
            key = [key]
        elif is_list_like(key):
            key = list(key)

        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        elif isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected code, the type of the key is checked using `isinstance` and then handled accordingly. This ensures that each type of key is properly processed and eliminates the potential for unexpected behavior.
