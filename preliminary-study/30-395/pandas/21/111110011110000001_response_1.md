The error seems to occur when the `test_getitem_no_matches` function attempts to access the `ser` object with a `key`, which results in a `KeyError` not being raised as expected. This suggests that the `_get_with` function, which is responsible for handling the key access, might have a bug.

Upon analyzing the `_get_with` function, it appears that the bug might be related to the handling of different key types. The function has conditional checks for different key types such as `slice`, `ABCDataFrame`, `tuple`, `list`, etc., and based on these types, it tries to access the data using indexing, slicing, or reindexing. 

The bug might be occurring due to incorrect handling or conditional branching for different key types, leading to unexpected behavior when attempting to access the data using the `key`.

To fix the bug, the conditional branches in the `_get_with` function need to be reviewed and potentially restructured to ensure correct handling of different key types. Proper validation and handling of key types are necessary to avoid unexpected errors such as the `KeyError` observed in the test case.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected code, the conditional branching has been simplified. If the `key` is not a slice, DataFrame, or a tuple, it directly calls the `reindex` method, which seems to be the appropriate action for handling key access in this context.
