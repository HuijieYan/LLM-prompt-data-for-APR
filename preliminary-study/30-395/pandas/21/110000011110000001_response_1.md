Potential Error Location: The problematic function is likely not handling the input `box` correctly, leading to a failure in the test cases.

Reason for the Bug: The buggy function is not properly handling the input `box` for the test cases. This results in the failure of the test cases where the desired behavior is not achieved.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: The function should be modified to correctly handle the input `box` in accordance with the test cases to ensure the expected behavior.

Corrected Code:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    import pandas.api.indexers as indexers

    if isinstance(key, slice):
        key = indexers.convert_to_index_slice(key)
        return self._slice(key)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    else:
        key = indexers.convert_to_index(key)
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
```
