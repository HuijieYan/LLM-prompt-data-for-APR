The error in the `test_getitem_no_matches` test function is caused by the incorrect behavior of the `_get_with` method within the `Series` class. The method is supposed to handle various types of input keys (e.g., lists, ndarrays, Index, Series) and return the appropriate slice of data according to the input key. However, the method is currently returning incorrect values, which leads to the test failure.

The bug occurs because the `_get_with` method does not handle the input keys correctly. It incorrectly determines the type of the input key and attempts to slice the data based on that determination. This leads to the incorrect return values and the subsequent test failure.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to modify the logic within the `_get_with` method to correctly handle different types of input keys. Specifically, the method should correctly differentiate between list-like, Index, Series, and other types of keys, and return the appropriate slice of data based on the input key type.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` method:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, pd.Index, pd.Series)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected code, the `_get_with` method now correctly handles different types of input keys and returns the appropriate slice of data accordingly. This should resolve the bug and make the `test_getitem_no_matches` function pass without errors.
