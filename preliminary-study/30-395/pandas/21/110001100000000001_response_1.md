The bug in the function `_get_with` is that it is not handling the `key` parameter correctly and is missing some conditions for different types of inputs. It also seems to be checking for the type `ABCDataFrame` which may not be the correct type to check for.

The `key` parameter is checked for its type using `isinstance()` but there are different conditions for different types of inputs that are not being handled properly.

The potential error location is in the conditional checks for different types of `key` inputs.

To fix the bug, we need to handle different key types separately. We can use `isinstance` to check for DataFrame, and then address other types of input such as tuple, list, numpy array, etc. separately.

The corrected code for the `get_with` function is as follows:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame): # Check for DataFrame
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not pd.api.types.is_list_like(key): # Check if key is scalar
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, pd.api.types.ExtensionArray, pd.Series, pd.Index)):
        if isinstance(key, pd.Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
    
        if isinstance(key, list):
            # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
            return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```
