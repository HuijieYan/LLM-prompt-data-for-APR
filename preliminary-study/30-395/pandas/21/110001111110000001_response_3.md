The error seems to be related to the way the `ser[key]` operation is handled, leading to a `KeyError`. The `ser` is a pandas Series, and `key` is an instance of the classes `list`, `numpy.array`, `pd.Index`, and `pd.Series`. 

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `_get_with` method, specifically in the handling of different types for the `key` parameter.

The bug may be occurring due to the way input `key` is being handled with different data types and due to the logic for different types of input being incorrect. The function tries to handle various types of input, but the conditional statements and logic are not in an optimal form.

The bug can be fixed by refactoring the handling of input types in a more structured and consistent way. This can involve changing the conditional logic and using appropriate methods for handling different types of input. 

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (pd.DataFrame, pd.Series)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or Series is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame or Series column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif isinstance(key, (int, np.integer)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This refactored code handles different data types in a more clear and concise manner, and it avoids repeating type checks and using appropriate methods for handling the inputs.
