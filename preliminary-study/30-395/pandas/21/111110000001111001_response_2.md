The bug seems to be related to the determination of the `key_type` in the `_get_with` function. The function tries to infer the `key_type` based on the type of key provided, but the logic may not be working as expected for all cases. This causes the function to return the wrong results or raise an error, leading to inconsistencies in the type of the returned values.

To fix this bug, the logic for determining the `key_type` needs to be revised. Instead of relying on the type of the `key` alone, a combination of checks should be performed to accurately infer the `key_type` based on the type and properties of the `key`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = 'other'  # Set a default value if type inference fails

    if key_type == "integer" and not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional(key):
        # Check for positional indexer type and adjust the return type accordingly
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the revised code, the logic for inferring the `key_type` has been updated to ensure that it accurately reflects the type and properties of the `key` variable. This should mitigate the inconsistencies and errors encountered in the original implementation.
