The error occurs in the `_get_with` method. The bug is related to the incorrect handling of the input when it is a pandas Index, which leads to a `KeyError` being raised in the test function.

The potential error location within the `_get_with` method is the handling of the key when it is an instance of `Index`. 

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the method is not correctly handling the Index input, leading to a KeyError when trying to access the value in the Series.

To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to handle the case when the key is an instance of `Index`. Additionally, it's important to ensure that the correct method is called for the Index type to avoid the KeyError.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.reindex(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With these corrections, the issue with handling the Index input is addressed, and the KeyError in the test function should no longer occur.
