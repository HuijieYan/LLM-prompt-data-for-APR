The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of the key parameter. The code includes checks for various data types (slice, DataFrame, tuple, and others), but it doesn't handle the case where the key is a list. 

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index[key]
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif isinstance(key, (int, str)):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```
