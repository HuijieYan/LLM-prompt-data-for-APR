The bug seems to be in the `_get_with` method. The method is attempting to slice the Series using a key, but the slicing mechanism is not working as expected.

The error message indicates that the code fails to raise a KeyError when attempting to access the Series with a specific key.

The potential issue might be related to the incorrect handling of the key when performing the slicing operation.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the logic for handling the key, ensuring that it is correctly converted to a positional index when necessary. Additionally, the method should appropriately handle the different types of keys such as list, ndarray, Index, and Series.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` method:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = key
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By applying this correction, the method should now handle various types of keys and perform slicing operations correctly.
