The test case is designed to check whether an expected KeyError is raised when trying to access a non-existent index in a Series. The error message indicates that the KeyError was not raised as expected.

The potential error in the problematic function is likely in the logic for handling different types of indexers. It seems that the function is not correctly handling the key parameter, which leads to the KeyError not being raised as expected.

The bug occurs because the logic for handling different types of indexers and keys is not comprehensive and may be incorrectly categorizing the input key, leading to an incorrect path being taken in the execution flow of the function.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling different types of indexers and keys should be revised and properly structured to ensure that the function can correctly identify and handle the different types of inputs.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (pd.DataFrame, pd.Series)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or Series is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, pd.api.extensions.ExtensionArray, pd.Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, pd.Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The updated code includes more specific type checks and handling for different types of indexers and keys. It also addresses the correct categorization of input key types and their appropriate processing within the function.
