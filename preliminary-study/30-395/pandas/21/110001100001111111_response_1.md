The bug occurs when trying to index a Series with a list of values using `ser[list(key)]`. This approach results in a KeyError because the code treats list indexers differently from array-like indexers.

The bug seems to be located in the `_get_with` function, specifically in the `if isinstance(key, list)` block. The code inside this block is not handling the list indexer properly, resulting in inconsistent behavior.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers consistently. We can update the code inside the `if isinstance(key, list)` block to reindex the Series with the list of values, instead of returning `self.loc[key]` as it currently does.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)  # ensure key is a list

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this modification, the `ser[list(key)]` indexing approach will handle the list indexer consistently and will no longer result in a KeyError. The corrected function now accounts for both array-like and list indexers and ensures consistent behavior for indexing the Series.
