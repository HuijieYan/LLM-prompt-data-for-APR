The bug occurs in the `_get_with` method, where the code treats list indexers differently from other indexers, leading to an inconsistent behavior when trying to access elements in the Series.

The reason behind this bug is that the code explicitly handles the case when the key is a list in a different way than when the key is an array-like object or an Index object. This inconsistency leads to unexpected behavior when accessing elements in the Series.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of indexers, regardless of whether they are lists, array-like objects, or Index objects. We should remove the special treatment of the list indexer and handle all indexers in the same way.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` method:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ("integer", "string"):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected code, we are treating all types of indexers in the same way, by first converting the key to a list if it's not list-like, and then checking its type to determine whether to use `loc` or `reindex` for accessing the elements in the Series. This approach ensures consistent handling of indexers and fixes the bug.
