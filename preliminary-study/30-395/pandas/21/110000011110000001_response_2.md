The issue seems to be with the `ser[key]` indexing operation within the test function. The bug is likely in the `_get_with` function, as it is called when a Series is indexed with `key`.

The bug occurs because the `_get_with` function is not handling all the cases where the key is a list, numpy array, pandas Index, or pandas Series correctly. In the provided code, there are multiple conditions to handle different types of indexers, but the handling logic is not complete and could be incorrect.

To fix the bug, you should revise the logic in the `_get_with` function to properly handle all the cases where the key can be a list, numpy array, pandas Index, or pandas Series, and ensure that the corresponding operations are executed correctly for each case. This may involve checking for the type of the key and applying the appropriate logic for that type.

Here's the corrected and updated `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    if isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, pd.ExtensionArray, pd.Series, pd.Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, pd.Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The updated logic in the `_get_with` function should now correctly handle various types of indexer inputs and perform the necessary operations based on the type of key provided.
