The function `_get_with` is being utilized to retrieve values based on different types of keys. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect use of the `key_type` variable. It is being derived from wrong sources as inferred and needs to be correctly deduced. The correct interpretation of `key_type` could be inferred by utilizing the respective data types and classes involved and then using it to decide the pathway for the function to follow.

The suggested approach to fix the bug in the `_get_with` function is to enhance the process of determining `key_type` and utilize it to guide the conditional pathways within the function. Additionally, make sure to handle the keys appropriately for all formats, such as list, ndarray, and Index objects.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "string":
        return self.loc[key]
    elif key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```
