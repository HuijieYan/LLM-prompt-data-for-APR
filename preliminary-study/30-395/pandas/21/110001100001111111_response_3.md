Potential error location: The bug seems to be occurring at the last `elif` condition in the `_get_with` function, where the function tries to handle the case for a list key. It seems that the function is unable to handle the list key correctly and is leading to the KeyError.

Reasons behind the bug:
The issue arises from the fact that the function is treating the list indexers differently from array-like indexers, as mentioned in the GitHub issue description. This inconsistency in the handling of list indexers is leading to the KeyError for the list index case.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` needs to handle the list indexers consistently with the other array-like indexers. This may involve aligning the handling of list indexers with that of array-like indexers and ensuring that the function is able to process the list index correctly without causing a KeyError.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handling list indexers consistently with other array-like indexers
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Assuming key is a list at this stage
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected code, the function now handles list indexers consistently with the other array-like indexers, ensuring that it can process list indexes correctly without causing a KeyError.
