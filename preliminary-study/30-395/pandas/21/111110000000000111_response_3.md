Potential Error Location:
The potential error location within the problematic function is in the conditional block for handling a list-like key. The code in this block seems to be causing the issue described in the GitHub issue, where the `ser[list(key)]` operation raises a KeyError.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the conditional block for handling list-like keys is not correctly handling the input. It seems that the code is not properly converting the list key to the appropriate form for indexing the Series.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
One possible approach to fix the bug is to review the way list-like keys are being handled in the conditional block and ensure that the correct conversion or indexing method is used for list keys.

Corrected Code:
Here is the corrected code for the problematic function `_get_with`:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle list-like key
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected code, the handling of list-like keys has been improved to ensure that the input is properly converted to the appropriate form for indexing the Series. This should address the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
