The error occurs in the `_get_with` function. The function is not correctly handling the input parameter `key` in different forms, such as list, ndarray, Index, or Series. The function is supposed to handle these various types of input `key` objects based on their types and perform corresponding operations. The function is currently failing to do so, resulting in the KeyError being raised in the test.

The bug occurs because the function does not have proper handling for different types of input key objects. It tries to handle the input key object in one way without considering its type.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle input `key` objects based on their types, such as list, ndarray, Index, or Series. Each type should be handled separately to perform the correct operations.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Handle different types of key objects
    if isinstance(key, Index) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Other cases
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function should correctly handle the input `key` object based on its type and perform the appropriate operations, thus resolving the bug.
