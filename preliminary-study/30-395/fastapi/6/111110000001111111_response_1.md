The issue here seems to be related to the handling of repeated keys in form data. The function `request_body_to_args` is designed to handle the conversion of received body parameters to arguments, but it seems to have an issue with processing repeated keys in form data.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where a key has multiple values in the form data. Instead, it only considers the last value for the key, leading to incorrect validation of the values.

To fix this issue, the function should be modified to handle repeated keys in form data and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation happens.

Below is the fixed code for the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Optional, Union, Tuple
from pydantic.fields import ModelField
from fastapi.datastructures import FormData
from pydantic.error_wrappers import ErrorWrapper
from pydantic.errors import MissingError
from pydantic.dataclasses import FieldInfo
from pydantic import BaseModel

async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        field = required_params[0]
        field_info = get_field_info(field)
        embed = getattr(field_info, "embed", None)
        if len(required_params) == 1 and not embed:
            received_body = {field.alias: received_body}
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias) if isinstance(received_body, FormData) else received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
                if isinstance(value, list):
                    value = [await v.read() for v in value]
                else:
                    value = await value.read()
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the fixed code, the function explicitly checks if the received body is an instance of `FormData` and then uses the `getlist` method to get all values for the given key. It also handles the case where the value is a list and processes each item accordingly.

This should address the issue with handling repeated keys in form data and ensure that all values are considered during validation.
