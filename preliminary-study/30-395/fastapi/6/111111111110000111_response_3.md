The bug seems to be related to the async function `request_body_to_args` which is used to handle request body and required parameters.

The error message from the test function indicates that the response status code is 422, which means there was an issue with the request parameters. This points to the buggy function `request_body_to_args` as the source of the problem.

The issue seems to be related to how the function handles repeated keys in form data. It appears that the function is not correctly handling the case where a key in the form data has multiple values. This causes the validation to fail and results in a 422 status code for the response.

To fix the bug, the function `request_body_to_args` needs to be modified to properly handle repeated keys in the form data and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation happens.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict, Any
from pydantic.fields import ModelField
from fastapi.params import Form, File
from fastapi import UploadFile, FormData
from pydantic.error_wrappers import ErrorWrapper
from pydantic import BaseConfig
from copy import deepcopy
import asyncio

async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None:
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
                    if isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                        value = await value.read()
                    elif isinstance(value, list):
                        awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                        contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                        value = contents
                if isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "":
                    value = field.default
                if isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and field.shape in sequence_shapes and len(value) == 0:
                    value = field.default
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected function, we have removed the part of the code that was causing issues with handling repeated keys in the form data. Instead, we directly handle the case where the value is a list by extracting the list of values from the form data and processing them accordingly. This should address the issue and allow the function to properly handle repeated keys in form data.
