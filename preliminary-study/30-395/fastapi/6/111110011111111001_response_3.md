The bug occurs in the function "request_body_to_args" which is responsible for processing the body of a request and converting it into arguments. The bug appears to be related to the handling of non-typing sequences such as lists, sets, and tuples.

The error messages from the test cases indicate that the expected response status code of 200 is not being returned, and instead, a 422 status code is being returned, which corresponds to a validation error.

Upon examining the function, it appears that the bug is related to the incorrect handling of non-typing sequences in the request body. The function is not correctly validating the non-typing sequences such as lists, sets, and tuples, leading to validation errors and incorrect responses.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle non-typing sequences in the request body and perform proper validation on them.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict, Any
from pydantic.fields import ModelField
from pydantic.error_wrappers import ErrorWrapper
from pydantic.typing import Union, Dict, FormData
import asyncio
from fastapi import UploadFile
from copy import deepcopy
from app.params import Form
from app import sequence_shapes, lenient_issubclass, params

def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if field.name in received_body:
            value = received_body[field.name]
            valid_value, error = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.name))
            if error:
                errors.append(error)
            else:
                values[field.name] = valid_value
    
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected code, we have simplified the function to iterate through the required parameters and directly extract the values from the received body based on the field names. We then perform validation for each field and collect any errors encountered during this process.

This corrected code should now handle non-typing sequences properly and perform the required validation, addressing the issues observed in the test cases.
