The bug in the provided function is likely related to how it processes the `received_body` parameter. It seems to loop through the `required_params` and attempts to retrieve values from the `received_body` based on the alias of each field. However, there are several issues in this process that could lead to errors.

One issue is the check for `received_body` being an instance of `FormData`. This could lead to problems if the received_body is not of this type. Additionally, the assignment of `received_body` within the loop may override the original value, causing unexpected behavior.

To fix this function, it needs to handle the `received_body` parameter more appropriately and ensure that the values are being retrieved correctly for each field.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Optional, Union, Tuple
from pydantic import ModelField
from pydantic.fields import ModelField as FieldInfo
from pydantic import form as params
from copy import deepcopy

async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        field_info: FieldInfo = get_field_info(field)
        embed = getattr(field_info, "embed", None)

        if received_body is not None:
            if field.alias in received_body:
                value = received_body[field.alias]

        if (
            value is None
            or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
            or (
                isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and len(value) == 0
            )
        ):
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue

        if (
            isinstance(field_info, params.File)
            and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
            and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
        ):
            value = await value.read()
        elif (
            field.shape in sequence_shapes
            and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
            and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
            and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
        ):
            awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
            contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
            value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)

        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```
