This error is caused by a bug in the `request_body_to_args` function. From the test cases, we can see that the response status code is expected to be 200, but it is actually returning 422. This suggests that there are validation errors occurring when processing the request body into arguments.

The potential error location within the `request_body_to_args` function is likely in the validation process when parsing the request body into arguments. It seems like the function is not correctly handling the input data when received as a Python list, set, or tuple.

The bug occurs because the function is not able to properly handle the input data when it's passed as a list, set, or tuple. It seems to be treating them as individual items, rather than properly processing the sequence.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to correctly handle Python lists, sets, and tuples when parsing the request body. This can include checking the type of the input data and processing it accordingly, rather than treating it as a single item.

Below is the corrected code for the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Optional, Union, Tuple
from pydantic.fields import ModelField
from pydantic import params, FormData, ErrorWrapper, MissingError, BaseConfig
from copy import deepcopy
from fastapi import UploadFile
import asyncio

async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias) if field.shape in sequence_shapes else received_body.get(field.alias)
        if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "") or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and field.shape in sequence_shapes and len(value) == 0):
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue
        if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
            value = await value.read()
        elif field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
            awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
            contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
            value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected code, we process the request body data differently based on its type and shape, to account for Python lists, sets, and tuples. This should resolve the validation errors and produce the expected response status code of 200 in the test cases.
