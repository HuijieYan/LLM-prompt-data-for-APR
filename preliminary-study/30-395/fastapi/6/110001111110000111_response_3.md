The error occurs when the test functions try to assert that the response status code is 200, but it's actually returning 422. This indicates a validation error is happening when the code is trying to process the request data.

The potential error location within the `request_body_to_args` function is likely in the handling of the request body data, specifically when dealing with sequence_shapes and FormData. There seems to be a problem with how the function processes repeated key=value pairs in form data.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle repeated keys in form data properly. It only captures the last value for a given key, which is not the expected behavior.

To fix the bug, the `request_body_to_args` function needs to be modified to properly handle repeated keys in form data and ensure that all values for a given key are captured and processed as a list. This will align with the expected behavior of capturing all values for repeated keys.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Optional, Union, Tuple
from pydantic.fields import ModelField
from fastapi import Form, UploadFile
from pydantic.main import create_model
from copy import deepcopy
from fastapi.encoders import sequence_types, sequence_shape_to_type
from fastapi.utils import lenient_issubclass
from pydantic.config import BaseConfig
from pydantic.errors import ErrorWrapper
from pydantic.error_wrappers import MissingError
import asyncio


async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shape_to_type and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            
            if value is None or (isinstance(field.default, list) and len(value) == 0):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            
            if isinstance(field_info, Form) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                value = await value.read()
            elif field.shape in sequence_shape_to_type and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected code, the function processes repeated keys in form data and captures all values for a given key, ensuring that they are processed as a list. This aligns with the expected behavior and should fix the bug.
