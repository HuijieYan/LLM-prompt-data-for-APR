The issue description is:

```text
Version: 0.8.0-1 (ubuntu).

When overriding the HTTP Host header you'll end up with duplicate headers if the casing of the command line option isn't correct.

$ http -pHh http://localhost/cgi-bin/test.cgi host:www.foo.com
GET /cgi-bin/test.cgi HTTP/1.1
Accept: */*
Host: localhost
host: www.foo.com
If I specify Host:www.foo.com all is well. User-Agent seems to be handled correctly, so I guess there is some thought given to it.

PS: httpie is a great tool. I like it a lot.
