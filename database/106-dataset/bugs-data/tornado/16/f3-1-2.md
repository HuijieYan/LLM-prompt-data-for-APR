The issue description is:

```text
Using weak reference in gen.WaitIterator is problematic, added a test to prove it.

Replacing the test with

    @gen_test
    def test_no_ref(self):
        ref = gen.WaitIterator(gen.sleep(0))

        yield gen.with_timeout(datetime.timedelta(seconds=0.1),
                               ref.next())
Passes
```
