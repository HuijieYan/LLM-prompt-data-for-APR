The issue description is:

```text
Code Sample, a copy-pastable example if possible
import json
import pandas as pd

test_data = [{"col": "31900441201190696999"}, {"col": "Text"}]
test_json = json.dumps(test_data)
pd.read_json(test_json)
Problem description
The current behaviour doesn't return a dateframe for a valid JSON. Note when the number is smaller, it works fine. It also works when only big numbers are present. It would be cool to have it work with big numbers as it works for small numbers.

Expected Output
A dataframe with a number and string

       col
0  3.190044e+19
1     Text
```
