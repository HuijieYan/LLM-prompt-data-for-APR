Code Sample, a copy-pastable example if possible
# if locale.getpreferredencoding() != 'UTF-8'
import pandas as pd

with open('test.json', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    f.write('{"A": ["АБВГДабвгд가"]}') 
dt2 = pd.read_json('test.json')
print(dt2)
# if locale.getpreferredencoding() == 'UTF-8'
import pandas as pd
from unittest import mock

with open('test.json', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    f.write('{"A": ["АБВГДабвгд가"]}') 
with mock.patch('_bootlocale.getpreferredencoding', return_value='cp949'):
    dt2 = pd.read_json('test.json')
    print(dt2)
Problem description
According to the docs, when encoding parameter is not given, read_json() uses utf-8 for a default encoding.

However, when read_json() is called without encoding parameter, it calls built-in open() method to open a file and open() uses return value of locale.getpreferredencoding() to determine the encoding which can be something not utf-8 (My test environment was cp949 in Windows10/Korean).
```
