The issue description is:

```text
 I have checked that this issue has not already been reported.

 I have confirmed this bug exists on the latest version of pandas.

 (optional) I have confirmed this bug exists on the master branch of pandas.

Code Sample, a copy-pastable example
import pandas as pd
print(pd.__version__)

sr = pd.Series(['a','b','c','d','e'])
others = pd.Index(['a','b','c','d','e'])

result = sr.str.cat(others=others)
print(result)

1.0.3
0    NaN
1    NaN
2    NaN
3    NaN
4    NaN
dtype: object
Problem description
The result should be the same as when others is a list or numpy array with the same values. The result is correct for pandas < 1.0.

Expected Output
0    aa
1    bb
2    cc
3    dd
4    ee
dtype: object
```
