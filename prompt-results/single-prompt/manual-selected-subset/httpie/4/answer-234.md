The bug appears to be due to the fact that if a 'Host' header already exists in the headers, it doesn't get overwritten, so the header might be sent twice, which is ambiguous for the server. To fix this, we need to change code to make sure if a 'Host' header already exists it should be overwritten, not added.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
	def headers(self):
		url = urlsplit(self._orig.url)

		request_line = '{method} {path}{query} HTTP/1.1'.format(
			method=self._orig.method,
			path=url.path or '/',
			query='?' + url.query if url.query else ''
		)

		headers = dict(self._orig.headers)
		headers['Host'] = url.netloc.split('@')[-1]

		headers = ['%s: %s' % (name, value)
				   for name, value in headers.items()]

		headers.insert(0, request_line)
		headers = '\n'.join(headers).strip()

		if isinstance(headers, bytes):
			# Python < 3
			headers = headers.decode('utf8')
		return headers
```

The key change here is this line:

```python
headers['Host'] = url.netloc.split('@')[-1]
```

Before the change, if 'Host' was not in headers, it would be added with this line. After the change, the 'Host' value in headers is always updated with this line. So, if a 'Host' header value already exists, it will be overwritten by this header value, which is the intended behavior.
