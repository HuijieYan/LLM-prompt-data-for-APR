The provided Python code does not contain any syntax errors. However, since the bug report mention 'fix typos', there might be a misinterpretation between how a function is being used versus its actual usage.

The 'click' package used in the code is a command line interface library in Python. The function 'click.prompt' is used to get user input.

Here, I am assuming that the 'TypeError and 'ValueError' exceptions are not considered bugs, as they are required when the user provides wrong input type or an empty options list.

Looking at the code, I couldn't find any typo. However, guessing from context, the issue might be given with indent error or missing import for OrderedDict and click.

Here is the code with typo(s) fixed:

	from collections import OrderedDict
	import click

	def read_user_choice(var_name, options):
		"""Prompt the user to choose from several options for the given variable.

		The first item will be returned if no input happens.

		:param str var_name: Variable as specified in the context
		:param list options: Sequence of options that are available to select from
		:return: Exactly one item of ``options`` that has been chosen by the user
		"""
		# Please see http://click.pocoo.org/4/api/#click.prompt
		if not isinstance(options, list):
			raise TypeError

		if not options:
			raise ValueError

		choice_map = OrderedDict(
			(u'{}'.format(i), value) for i, value in enumerate(options, 1)
		)
		choices = choice_map.keys()
		default = u'1'

		choice_lines = [u'{} - {}'.format(*c) for c in choice_map.items()]
		prompt = u'\n'.join((
			u'Select {}:'.format(var_name),
			u'\n'.join(choice_lines),
			u'Choose from {}'.format(u', '.join(choices))
		))

		user_choice = click.prompt(
			prompt, type=click.Choice(choices), default=default
		)
		return choice_map[user_choice]
