The original code provided in the problem seems to have issues with the importation of necessary modules and packages such as "click", "OrderedDict". Also, the string creation at the prompt variable is formed incorrectly. A Proper python string creation and imports of necessary modules and packages should fix the bug.

Here is the fixed python code:

```
    import click
    from collections import OrderedDict

    def read_user_choice(var_name, options):
        """Prompt the user to choose from several options for the given variable.

        The first item will be returned if no input happens.

        :param str var_name: Variable as specified in the context
        :param list options: Sequence of options that are available to select from
        :return: Exactly one item of ``options`` that has been chosen by the user
        """
        # Please see http://click.pocoo.org/4/api/#click.prompt
        if not isinstance(options, list):
            raise TypeError

        if not options:
            raise ValueError

        choice_map = OrderedDict(
            (u'{}'.format(i), value) for i, value in enumerate(options, 1)
        )
        choices = choice_map.keys()
        default = u'1'

        choice_lines = [u'{} - {}'.format(*c) for c in choice_map.items()]
        prompt = u'Select {}:\n'.format(var_name) + u'\n'.join(choice_lines) + u'\nChoose from {}'.format(u', '.join(choices))

        user_choice = click.prompt(
            prompt, type=click.Choice(choices), default=default
        )
        return choice_map[user_choice]
```

With this fix, the necessary modules are properly imported and the erroneous string creation is corrected. This should understandably pass the failed tests without affecting the ones that already passed.
