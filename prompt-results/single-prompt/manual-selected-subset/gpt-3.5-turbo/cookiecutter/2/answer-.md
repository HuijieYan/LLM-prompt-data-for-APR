To fix the provided code snippet, I made the following changes:

1. Imported the `os` and `logger` objects, as they were used in the function but not imported.
2. Created a stub `valid_hook()` function as it is called within the `find_hook()` function but not defined in the provided code. Please replace the stub with the actual `valid_hook()` implementation when incorporating this fix into your project.

Here is the fixed code snippet:

```python
import os
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def valid_hook(hook_file, hook_name):
    # This is a stub for the actual valid_hook function implementation.
    # Replace this with your project's actual valid_hook function.
    return hook_file == hook_name


def find_hook(hook_name, hooks_dir='hooks'):
    """Return a dict of all hook scripts provided.

    Must be called with the project template as the current working directory.
    Dict's key will be the hook/script's name, without extension, while values
    will be the absolute path to the script. Missing scripts will not be
    included in the returned dict.

    :param hook_name: The hook to find
    :param hooks_dir: The hook directory in the template
    :return: The absolute path to the hook script or None
    """
    logger.debug('hooks_dir is %s', os.path.abspath(hooks_dir))

    if not os.path.isdir(hooks_dir):
        logger.debug('No hooks/dir in template_dir')
        return None

    scripts = []
    for hook_file in os.listdir(hooks_dir):
        if valid_hook(hook_file, hook_name):
            return os.path.abspath(os.path.join(hooks_dir, hook_file))

    return None
```

Again, please make sure to replace the `valid_hook()` function with the actual implementation when incorporating the changes into your project.
