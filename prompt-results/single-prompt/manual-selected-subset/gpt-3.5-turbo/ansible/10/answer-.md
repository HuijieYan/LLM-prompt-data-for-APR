The provided code snippet seems to have a bug when updating the previous and next pointers. This issue can be resolved by properly handling the pointer updates.

Here is the fixed code snippet:

```python
	def remove(self, rule_type, rule_control, rule_path):
		current_line = self._head
		changed = 0

		while current_line is not None:
			if current_line.matches(rule_type, rule_control, rule_path):
				if current_line.prev is not None:
					current_line.prev.next = current_line.next
				else:
					self._head = current_line.next
                    
				if current_line.next is not None:
					current_line.next.prev = current_line.prev

				changed += 1

			current_line = current_line.next
		return changed
```

The main change here is that we separate the conditions for updating the previous and next pointers, only updating the `prev` pointer of `current_line.next` if `current_line.next` is not `None`. This should fix the bug and pass the failed test without affecting already passed tests.
