Certainly! The error is occurring because the compat_chr function is being called with a value that is not within the valid Unicode range. To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the value passed to compat_chr is valid. I will provide you with a fixed version of the code snippet:

    import re

    def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
        """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
        # Known non-numeric HTML entity
        if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
            return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

        mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
        if mobj is not None:
            numstr = mobj.group(1)
            if numstr.startswith('x'):
                base = 16
                numstr = '0%s' % numstr
            else:
                base = 10
            num = int(numstr, base)
            
            # Ensure the num is within valid Unicode range
            if 0 <= num <= 0x10FFFF:
                return compat_chr(num)
            else:
                # Return a placeholder character if the num is invalid
                return '\uFFFD'

        # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
        return ('&%s;' % entity)

In this code, I've added a check to ensure that the num value is within the valid Unicode range (0x0000 to 0x10FFFF). If the value is within the valid range, it will be passed to compat_chr. If the value is outside the range, I've returned the Unicode replacement character '\uFFFD' as a placeholder.

This modification should address the ValueError issue while ensuring that existing tests continue to work correctly.
