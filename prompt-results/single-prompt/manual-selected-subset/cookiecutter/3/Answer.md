It looks like the code snippet is using the click.prompt function from the click library, and you want to fix the bug while making minimal changes to the source code. The main issue seems to be with how the click.prompt function is being used and how the options are presented to the user. To fix the bug and adhere to the specifications, you can make the following changes:

Import the required click module at the beginning of the code.
Modify the way options are presented to the user so that the user can select a valid option using numbers.
Update the way the click.prompt function is used to handle user input.

Here's the fixed code snippet with minimal changes:

    import click
    from collections import OrderedDict

    def read_user_choice(var_name, options):
        """Prompt the user to choose from several options for the given variable.

        The first item will be returned if no input happens.

        :param str var_name: Variable as specified in the context
        :param list options: Sequence of options that are available to select from
        :return: Exactly one item of ``options`` that has been chosen by the user
        """
        if not isinstance(options, list):
            raise TypeError

        if not options:
            raise ValueError

        choice_map = OrderedDict(
            (str(i), value) for i, value in enumerate(options, 1)
        )
        choices = choice_map.keys()
        default = '1'

        choice_lines = [f'{c[0]} - {c[1]}' for c in choice_map.items()]
        prompt = '\n'.join((
            f'Select {var_name}:',
            '\n'.join(choice_lines),
            f'Choose from {", ".join(choices)}'
        ))

        user_choice = click.prompt(
            prompt, type=click.Choice(choices), default=default, show_default=False
        )
        return choice_map[user_choice]


Explanation of changes:

I imported the click module at the beginning of the code.
I changed the key of choice_map to strings using str(i) to match the expected user input.
I formatted the choice lines using f-strings (f'{c[0]} - {c[1]}') for readability.
I set show_default to False to hide the default value in the prompt.
These changes should fix the bug and ensure that the function works as intended according to the given specifications.
