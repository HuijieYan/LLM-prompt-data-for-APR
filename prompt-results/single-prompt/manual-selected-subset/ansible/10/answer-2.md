The AttributeError is likely occurring because of trying to access the 'prev' or 'next' attribute of None when trying to remove the first or last rule. 'current_line.next' will be None when 'current_line' is the last node in the list. Similarly, 'current_line.prev' will be None when 'current_line' is the first node in the list. So, we must check if 'current_line.next' or 'current_line.prev' is not None before accessing their 'prev' or 'next' attributes respectively.

Here is how you can get rid of these AttributeErrors:

	def remove(self, rule_type, rule_control, rule_path):
		current_line = self._head
		changed = 0

		while current_line is not None:
			if current_line.matches(rule_type, rule_control, rule_path):
				if current_line.prev is not None:
					current_line.prev.next = current_line.next
					if current_line.next is not None:
						current_line.next.prev = current_line.prev
				else:
					self._head = current_line.next
					if self._head is not None:
						self._head.prev = None
				changed += 1

			current_line = current_line.next
		return changed

Now, 'current_line.next.prev' is only accessed if 'current_line.next' is not None, and 'self._head.prev' is only accessed if 'self._head' is not None, preventing the AttributeError.
