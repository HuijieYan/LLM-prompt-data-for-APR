Here's the fixed version of the `headers` method. The issue was that the custom Host header was being overwritten by the default one. In this fix, the custom Host header is preserved by adding a check that it does not already exist in the original headers.

```python
from urllib.parse import urlsplit

def headers(self):
    url = urlsplit(self._orig.url)

    request_line = '{method} {path}{query} HTTP/1.1'.format(
        method=self._orig.method,
        path=url.path or '/',
        query='?' + url.query if url.query else ''
    )

    headers = dict(self._orig.headers)
    if 'Host' not in headers:
        headers['Host'] = url.netloc.split('@')[-1]
    else:
        headers['Host'] = self._orig.headers['Host']

    headers = ['%s: %s' % (name, value)
               for name, value in headers.items()]

    headers.insert(0, request_line)
    headers = '\r\n'.join(headers).strip()

    if isinstance(headers, bytes):
        # Python < 3
        headers = headers.decode('utf8')
    return headers
```

This change should be a drop-in replacement and will pass the previously failed test while not affecting the other tests that have already passed.
