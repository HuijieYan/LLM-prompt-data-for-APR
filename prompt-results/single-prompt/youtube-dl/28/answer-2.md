The bug arises due to the limitation of the python function unichr() which only allows Unicode strings of length 1, and only for integers 0 through 0x10FFFF (inclusive) which can result into ValueError for the unsupported range.

To fix this bug, we need to add a condition to check if the code point is within the acceptable range. Here is the drop-in replacement for the above function with minimal change that should pass the failed test:

```python
def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        # See https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/issues/7518
        num = int(numstr, base)
        # check if number is within valid range for unichr
        if 0 <= num <= 0x10FFFF:
            return compat_chr(num)
    
    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```

This solution won't affect any other tests that were already passed because it doesn't modify other parts of the code outside solving the bug. It only adds an extra restriction that solves the problem specified by the ValueError.
