The issue in the code is that it expects the `param` value to be a boolean, but in some cases, it could be `None`. To fix this issue, we can modify the code to handle the `None` value and treat it as `False`.

Here's the fixed code:

```python
def cli_bool_option(params, command_option, param, true_value='true', false_value='false', separator=None):
    param = params.get(param)
    if param is None:
        param = False  # Treat None as False
    assert isinstance(param, bool)

    if separator:
        return [command_option + separator + (true_value if param else false_value)]
    return [command_option, true_value if param else false_value]
```

Explanation:
- In the original code, if `param` is `None`, it returns an empty list `[]`. To fix this, we set `param` to `False` before checking its type.
- The assertion `assert isinstance(param, bool)` remains the same to ensure `param` is a boolean.
- The rest of the code is unchanged.

Now the modified code should handle the case when `param` is `None` and appropriately treat it as `False` while keeping the behavior of the original code intact.
