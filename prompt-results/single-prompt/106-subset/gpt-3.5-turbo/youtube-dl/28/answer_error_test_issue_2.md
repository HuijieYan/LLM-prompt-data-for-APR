The bug is occurring because the `compat_chr` function is using the `unichr` function, which is limited to arguments within the Unicode range `0x110000`. To fix this bug, we need to replace the `compat_chr` function with a replacement that handles a wider range of characters.

One way to fix the bug is to use the `chr` function instead of `unichr`. The `chr` function can handle characters within the Unicode range `0x0000` to `0x10FFFF`, which includes the problematic value "'&#2013266066;'". 

Here is the fixed code snippet:

```python
import re

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])
    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        return chr(int(numstr, base))
```
After applying this patch, the program should pass the test without affecting other successful tests.
