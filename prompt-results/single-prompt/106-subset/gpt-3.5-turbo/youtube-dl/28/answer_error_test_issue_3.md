To fix the bug, we need to handle the `ValueError` that occurs when `int(numstr, base)` is not in the range of `0x110000`. We can modify the `_htmlentity_transform` function to catch this exception and return the original HTML entity if the conversion fails.

Here's the fixed code snippet:

```python
import re

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
    try:
        # Known non-numeric HTML entity
        if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
            return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])
        mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
        if mobj is not None:
            numstr = mobj.group(1)
            if numstr.startswith('x'):
                base = 16
                numstr = '0%s' % numstr
            else:
                base = 10
            return compat_chr(int(numstr, base))
    except ValueError:
        pass
    return entity
```

With this fix, if the conversion to a character raises a `ValueError`, we catch the exception and return the original HTML entity. This ensures that the program doesn't fail when encountering HTML entities that are not valid Unicode characters.

This fix should allow the program to pass the failed test without affecting other successful tests, and it can be easily applied to the original project by replacing the `_htmlentity_transform` function with the fixed code snippet.
