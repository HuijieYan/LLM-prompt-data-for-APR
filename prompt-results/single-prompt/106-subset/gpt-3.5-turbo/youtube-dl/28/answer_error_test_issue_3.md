To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_htmlentity_transform` function to handle values that are greater than or equal to `0x110000`.
One way to do this is by checking if the value is within the valid range before calling `chr()` function.

Here's the updated code snippet:

```python
import re
import html.entities

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in html.entities.name2codepoint:
        return chr(html.entities.name2codepoint[entity])
    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        num = int(numstr, base)
        if num >= 0x110000:
            return '&#%s;' % entity
        return chr(num)
```

With this fix, the `_htmlentity_transform` function will return the original entity (`&#2013266066;`) if the value is greater than or equal to `0x110000`. The test case that was failing should now pass without affecting other successful tests.

Note: I've assumed that the `compat_html_entities` module is imported and used correctly elsewhere in the code. If not, you may need to import it in the fixed code as well.
