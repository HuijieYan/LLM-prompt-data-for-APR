To fix the bug in the code, we need to modify the `_htmlentity_transform` function to handle entities that are outside the range of Unicode characters.

The fixed code is as follows:

```python
def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])
    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
        else:
            base = 10
        try:
            # check if the argument is within the range of Unicode characters
            value = int(numstr, base)
            if 0 <= value <= 0x10FFFF:
                return compat_chr(value)
        except ValueError:
            pass
    return entity
```

With this modification, the program should be able to handle entities that are outside the range of Unicode characters without raising an error.
