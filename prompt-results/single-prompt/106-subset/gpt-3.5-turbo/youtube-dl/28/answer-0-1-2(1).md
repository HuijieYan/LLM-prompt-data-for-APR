The bug in the code is being caused by the fact that `compat_chr()` is returning a value that is not within the range of a valid Unicode character. To fix this issue, we can replace the `compat_chr()` function with `chr()`, which is a built-in function in Python that already handles the conversion from unicode code points to characters.

Here's the fixed code:

```
import re

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])
    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        return chr(int(numstr, base))
```

This fix should allow the program to pass the failing test without affecting other successful tests.
