Based on the error message and the provided code, the issue seems to be with the `compat_chr` function which is called in the `_htmlentity_transform` function. The `compat_chr` function is generating a `ValueError` when the input argument is not within the range of `0x110000`.

To fix this issue, I will update the `_htmlentity_transform` function to handle the `ValueError` and return the original input entity in case of an error. This will allow the program to pass the failed test without affecting other successful tests.

Here's the fixed code snippet:

```python
def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
    try:
        # Known non-numeric HTML entity
        if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
            return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])
        mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
        if mobj is not None:
            numstr = mobj.group(1)
            if numstr.startswith('x'):
                base = 16
                numstr = '0%s' % numstr
            else:
                base = 10
            return compat_chr(int(numstr, base))
    except ValueError:
        return entity
```

Now, the `_htmlentity_transform` function will catch any `ValueError` and return the original input entity. This will allow the program to handle invalid characters gracefully and pass the test that previously failed.
