To fix the bug in the `_htmlentity_transform` function, we need to modify the code that converts the HTML entity to a character. 
The issue is that the `chr()` function in Python raises a `ValueError` when the argument is not in the range `0x110000`. 

We can fix this issue by:
- Importing the `html` module from the `html.entities` package, which provides a dictionary mapping HTML entities to characters.
- Using the `html.unescape()` function to decode the HTML entities.

Here's the fixed code:

```python
from html import unescape

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
    return unescape(entity)
```

By using the `html.unescape()` function, which is part of the standard library, we can easily handle all HTML entities and avoid the `chr()` range error. This fix requires minimal changes to the source code and should pass the failed test without affecting other successful tests.
