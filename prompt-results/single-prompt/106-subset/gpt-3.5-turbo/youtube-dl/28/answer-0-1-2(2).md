The issue in the code is that the ValueError is raised when trying to convert the Unicode codepoint `numstr` to a character using `compat_chr()`. The error occurs because the codepoint value exceeds the valid range of Unicode characters.

To fix this issue, we can modify the code to check if the codepoint value is within the valid range before converting it to a character. If the codepoint value is greater than or equal to 0x110000, we can return the original entity without converting it.

Here's the modified code:

```python
import re
import html.entities as compat_html_entities

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])
    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        codepoint = int(numstr, base)
        if codepoint < 0x110000:
            return compat_chr(codepoint)
    return entity
```

This code adds a check to see if the `codepoint` value is less than 0x110000 before converting it to a character. If the check fails, it returns the original entity without converting it.

With this modification, the code should pass the failed test without impacting other successfully passed tests.
