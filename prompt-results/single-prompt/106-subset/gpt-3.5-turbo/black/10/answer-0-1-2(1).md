Here's the patched code that fixes the indentation issue:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    dedent_started = False # added flag to keep track of dedent start
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            dedent_started = False # reset the flag when a new line is encountered
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            if current_column < column and dedent_started: # check if dedent has started
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
        dedent_started = True # set the flag immediately after dedent is started
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

I have added a flag `dedent_started` to keep track of when the dedent starts. When we encounter a character other than whitespace or a new line, we check if the current column is less than the specified column and if the `dedent_started` flag is True. If so, we return the current lines as the result. This ensures that the comment will be indented correctly.

Please let me know if you need any further assistance.
