To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to modify the line where the comment is being added to the `current_line` variable. Currently, the comment is being added directly to `current_line`, which is causing the incorrect indentation.

We can fix this by introducing a new variable `indent` that keeps track of the current indentation. Whenever we encounter a new line or indentation, we update the `indent` variable accordingly.

Here's the updated code:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    indent = ""
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char

        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                indent = ""
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            indent += ' '
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            indent += '\t'
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            indent = ""
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            indent = ""

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this fix, the program should pass the failed test without affecting other successful tests.
