To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to ensure that the comment indentation is preserved after a dedent. Currently, the bug occurs because the code is appending the comment to the current line instead of starting a new line. To fix this, we can modify the code to check if the current line is empty before appending it to the lines list.

Here's the fixed code snippet:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                if current_line.strip():
                    lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This fix checks if the `current_line` is empty and only appends it to the `lines` list if it is not empty. This ensures that comments after a dedent are properly indented.
