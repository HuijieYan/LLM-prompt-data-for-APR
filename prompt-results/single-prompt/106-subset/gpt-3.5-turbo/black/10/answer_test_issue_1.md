The issue in the code is that the indentation of comments is being changed incorrectly after a dedent when the input file uses tabs. To fix this issue, you can replace the line `wait_for_nl = True` with `wait_for_nl = current_column == 0` in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function.

Here's the fixed code:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = current_column == 0
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This replacement ensures that the `wait_for_nl` flag is set to `True` only when `current_column` is 0. This will prevent the incorrect change in indentation for comments after a dedent when the input file uses tabs.
