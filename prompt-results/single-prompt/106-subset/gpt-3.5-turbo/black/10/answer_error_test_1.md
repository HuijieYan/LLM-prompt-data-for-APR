To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to modify the condition inside the `wait_for_nl` block. Currently, it checks if `char == '\n'`, but it should check if `char.strip() == '\n'`. This change ensures that an empty line with spaces or tabs will not be considered as the end of the indentation block.

Here's the fixed version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char.strip() == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This fix updates the condition `if char == '\n'` to `if char.strip() == '\n'` inside the `wait_for_nl` block. Now, an empty line with spaces or tabs won't be mistakenly considered as the end of the indentation block.
