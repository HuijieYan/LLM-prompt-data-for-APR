The bug in the code is that the line `lines.append(current_line)` should be placed before the line `wait_for_nl = False`. Currently, it is placed after the line `wait_for_nl = False`, which causes the line that starts with `#` to be included in `current_line` and not added to `lines`. This results in the difference between the expected and actual trees in the failed test.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The bug was fixed by moving the line `lines.append(current_line)` before `wait_for_nl = False`. This ensures that the line is added to `lines` before resetting `current_line` and `current_column`.

Now the fixed code should pass the failed test without affecting other successful tests.
