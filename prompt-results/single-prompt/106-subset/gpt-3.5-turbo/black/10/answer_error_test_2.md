The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is causing the test case `test_comment_indentation` to fail. The bug occurs when there is an unexpected empty line, resulting in the incorrect indentation of the comment.

I will fix the bug in the function by making the necessary changes:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                # handle unexpected non-empty line
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = char
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The changes made include:
- Adding an else statement to handle unexpected non-empty lines when `wait_for_nl` is `True`.
- Appending the current line to the lines list before starting a new line when handling unexpected non-empty lines.

These changes will ensure that the indentation of the comment is preserved correctly and that the test case `test_comment_indentation` will pass.
