The issue is caused by the incorrect handling of the indentation for comments after a dedent when using tabs. To fix this, we can modify the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to ensure that the comments are indented correctly.

Here's the fixed code:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                indented_line = '\t' * (current_column // 4) + current_line
                lines.append(indented_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the fixed code, we modify the line `lines.append(current_line)` to `lines.append(indented_line)`. We calculate the indent for the comment by multiplying the number of tabs (`current_column // 4`) and then append the indented line to the `lines` list.

This fix ensures that comments are indented correctly after a dedent, regardless of whether tabs or spaces are used for indentation.
