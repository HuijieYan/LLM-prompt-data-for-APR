To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we can replace the `wait_for_nl` variable with a `wait_for_indent` variable. This variable will keep track of whether the program is waiting for an indentation or waiting for a newline character. 

Here is the fixed code snippet:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_indent = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_indent:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_indent = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_indent = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_indent = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This fix replaces the `wait_for_nl` variable with `wait_for_indent` variable. The logic inside the loop is adjusted accordingly to track the waiting state and check for indentation. This fix ensures that the indentation is correctly handled for tabulated comments after a dedent.

After applying this fix, the program should pass the failed test without affecting other successful tests.
