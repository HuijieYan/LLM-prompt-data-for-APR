To fix the bug, we can modify the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the indentation of comments. Specifically, we need to ensure that the comment is indented the same as the next line when there is a dedent.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    is_comment = False  # track if current line is a comment
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                if is_comment:
                    # Adjust the indentation of the comment
                    lines.append(current_line[:-1] + ' ' * current_column + current_line[-1])
                else:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                is_comment = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':
            is_comment = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The modification ensures that if the current line is a comment and there is a dedent, the comment will be indented the same as the next line.

With this fix, the program should pass the failed test without affecting other successful tests.
