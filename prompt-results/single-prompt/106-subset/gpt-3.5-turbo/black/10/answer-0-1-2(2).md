To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent. Here's the updated code:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    indent_level = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            if indent_level > 0:
                current_line += " " * (indent_level * 4)
        else:
            # indent or dedent is finished
            if char == '#':
                indent_level = current_column // 4
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the updated code, we keep track of the indentation level using the `indent_level` variable. Whenever we encounter a newline character, we check if the `indent_level` is greater than 0 (indicating that there was a dedent) and then append the appropriate number of spaces to the current line to maintain the correct comment indentation.

This fix should correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent, allowing the test case `test_comment_indentation` to pass without affecting other tests.
