To fix the bug in the code, we need to adjust the indentation level of the comment based on the current column value.

The fixed code is as follows:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                current_line += ' ' * (column - current_column)
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The indentation adjustment is made in the `elif char == '\n'` block. If the current line is not empty and the current column is less than the desired column value, we add extra spaces to match the desired column.

This fix ensures that the comment indentation is adjusted correctly after a dedent, without affecting other parts of the code.

Note: This fix assumes that the desired column value `column` is always greater than or equal to 0.
