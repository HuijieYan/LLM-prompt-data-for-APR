You need to fix a bug in a python code snippet.

The buggy source code is following, and you should follow all specifications in comment if there exists comment:

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line



The test source code is following:

    def test_comment_indentation(self) -> None:
        contents_tab = "if 1:\n\tif 2:\n\t\tpass\n\t# comment\n\tpass\n"
        contents_spc = "if 1:\n    if 2:\n        pass\n    # comment\n    pass\n"

        self.assertFormatEqual(fs(contents_spc), contents_spc)
        self.assertFormatEqual(fs(contents_tab), contents_spc)

        contents_tab = "if 1:\n\tif 2:\n\t\tpass\n\t\t# comment\n\tpass\n"
        contents_spc = "if 1:\n    if 2:\n        pass\n        # comment\n    pass\n"

        self.assertFormatEqual(fs(contents_tab), contents_spc)
        self.assertFormatEqual(fs(contents_spc), contents_spc)



The raised issue description for this bug is:
Indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent

Operating system: Ubuntu 18.04
Python version: 3.6.3
Black version: master

Thank you @ambv for this library. When trying to run this on a codebase that uses tabs, indentation for comments past depth 0 is changed incorrectly after a dedent. Sample input (NB tabs):

if 1:
	if 2:
		pass
	# This comment should be indented the same as the next line
	pass
Black reformats this to:

if 1:
    if 2:
        pass
        # This comment should be indented the same as the next line
    pass
Note that this only happens when the input file uses tabs.
