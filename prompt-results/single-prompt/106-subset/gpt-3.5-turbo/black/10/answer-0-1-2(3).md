The bug in the code is caused by incorrect handling of indentation levels for comments. The fix involves modifying the logic to correctly track the current column and preserve the correct indentation for comments.

Here's the updated code:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                continue
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            if char == '#':
                current_column -= 1
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This fix ensures that the correct indentation level is maintained for comments after a dedent. The current column is correctly adjusted for comments by decrementing the column count by 1.
