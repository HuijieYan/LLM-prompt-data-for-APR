To fix the bug, you need to modify the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to properly handle the indentation of comments. Specifically, when encountering a tab character (`\t`), the function should calculate the correct indentation level by first converting tabs to spaces using the `expandtabs()` method.

Here's the updated code:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            # convert tabs to spaces
            current_column = current_line.expandtabs(4).index(char) + 1
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this modification, the function will fix the incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent when using tabs as input.
