To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comment indentation remains the same as the following line after a dedent. The problem occurs when the `wait_for_nl` flag is set to `True` and we encounter a newline character. In that case, we need to check the indentation of the current line and adjust the `current_column` accordingly.

Here's the fixed code:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line.rstrip('\r\n'))  # Strip newline characters to fix line endings
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                # Adjust current_column based on the indentation of the current line
                for c in current_line:
                    if c == ' ':
                        current_column += 1
                    elif c == '\t':
                        current_column += 4
                    else:
                        break
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This fix checks the indentation of the current line after encountering a newline character when `wait_for_nl` is `True`. It adjusts the `current_column` based on the indentation of the line.
