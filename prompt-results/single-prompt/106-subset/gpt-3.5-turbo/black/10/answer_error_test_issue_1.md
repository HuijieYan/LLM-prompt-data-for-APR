To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to adjust the handling of indentation and comments. Specifically, we should keep track of the indentation level and apply it to subsequent comments.

Here is the fixed code snippet:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    current_indentation = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            if current_column % 4 == 0:
                current_indentation += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_indentation += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            current_indentation = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            if current_line.strip().startswith('#'):
                current_column = current_indentation * 4
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

Changes made:
1. Added a new variable `current_indentation` to keep track of the current indentation level.
2. Adjusted the logic to update `current_indentation` when encountering spaces or tabs.
3. In the case of a comment (`char == '#'`) after indent completion, update `current_column` to match the current indentation level.

This fix ensures that comments are indented properly based on the indentation level of the code.
