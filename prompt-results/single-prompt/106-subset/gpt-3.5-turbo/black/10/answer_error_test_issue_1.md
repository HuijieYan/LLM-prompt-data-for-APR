To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to handle the case for the unexpected empty line correctly. Currently, the code resets the `current_column` to 0, which is incorrect.

Here's the fixed code:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This fix handles the case for an unexpected empty line correctly by checking if `current_column` is less than the expected `column`. If so, it returns the current result.

Testing this fix with the provided test cases should pass all tests without affecting other successful tests.
