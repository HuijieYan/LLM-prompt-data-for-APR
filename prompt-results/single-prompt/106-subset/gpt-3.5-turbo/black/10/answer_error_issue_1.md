The issue is that when the code encounters an indent of more than 0 spaces or tabs, it sets `wait_for_nl` to True, expecting the next character to be a newline character (`\n`) indicating the end of the indentation. However, if the next character is not a newline character, it incorrectly assumes that the indent has finished and continues reading the rest of the line as part of the current indentation.

To fix this issue, we can modify the code to keep track of the number of spaces (`current_space`) and the number of tabs (`current_tab`) encountered in the prefix string. We can then use these counts to determine the correct indentation level.

Here's the fixed code:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_space = 0
    current_tab = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_space + current_tab < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_space = 0
                current_tab = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_space += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_tab += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_space = 0
            current_tab = 0
        else:
           # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this fix, the code correctly counts the number of spaces and tabs encountered and compares it to the `column` value to determine if the indentation has finished.
