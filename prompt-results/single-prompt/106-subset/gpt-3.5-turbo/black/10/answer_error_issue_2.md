The bug in the code is due to the incorrect handling of indentation for comments after a dedent. To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic of the `wait_for_nl` condition. Currently, the check for `wait_for_nl` is inside the loop that checks for spaces, tabs, and newlines. This causes the comment to be incorrectly indented when there is a dedent before the comment.

To fix this bug, we can move the check for `wait_for_nl` outside the loop and modify the condition to check if the current_line is not empty. This will ensure that the comment is indented correctly.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    # Check if current line is not empty after loop ends
    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
        res = ''.join(lines)
        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making this change, the logic of the function remains the same, but the comment indentation issue after a dedent is fixed. The fix requires minimal changes to the code and should pass the failed test without affecting other successful tests.
