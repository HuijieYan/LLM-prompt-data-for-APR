To fix the bug in the code, we need to modify the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. The bug is caused by the program not correctly handling comments within decorators. The fix involves updating the check for decorators and adding conditions to handle comments in decorators.

Here's the modified code:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
        
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
        
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
        
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    # Fix for handling comments in decorators
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.prefix.endswith('#') and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
        before = before or 1
    
    return before, 0
```

The fix involves adding a condition to check if the previous line ends with `#` and is a decorator line. If this condition is true, we update the `before` variable with `before` or `1`.

With this fix, the program should be able to pass the failed test without affecting other successful tests.
