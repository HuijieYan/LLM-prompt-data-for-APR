To fix the bug in the code, we need to modify the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. The bug is in the code that handles decorators, where it is not correctly counting the number of newlines to insert before and after decorators when there are comments present.

Here is the fixed version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        # Fix the bug in decorator handling
        newlines = current_line.prefix.count("\n")
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines = min(newlines, 1)
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0
```

Explanation of the fix:
- The code now counts the number of newlines in the `current_line.prefix` instead of using a hardcoded number.
- It checks if the `current_line.depth` is non-zero and applies the constraint of at most 1 newline.
- The rest of the code remains the same.

With this fix, the program should pass the failed test case without affecting other successful test cases.
