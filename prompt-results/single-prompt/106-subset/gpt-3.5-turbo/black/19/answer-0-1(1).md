The bug in the code is that when there are extra newlines (\n) in the prefix of the first leaf in the "current_line.leaves" list, it should consume those newlines and set the prefix to an empty string. However, the code is not correctly handling the case where there are multiple newlines.

To fix this bug, I will modify the line of code that sets the "before" variable for the first leaf as follows:

```
before = len(first_leaf.prefix.splitlines()) - 1
```

This will count the number of lines in the prefix and subtract 1 to account for the newline at the end of each line. This will correctly handle the case where there are multiple newlines.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = len(first_leaf.prefix.splitlines()) - 1
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0
```

This fix will only affect the calculation of the "before" variable for the first leaf, while keeping the rest of the code intact. It should resolve the bug and pass the failed test without impacting other successfully passed tests.
