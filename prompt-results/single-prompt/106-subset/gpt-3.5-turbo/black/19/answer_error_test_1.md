The bug in the given code causes extra empty lines to be added between decorators in the output. To fix this bug, the code needs to be modified to remove the extra empty lines when adding decorators.

Here's the fixed code:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        # Updated code to remove extra empty lines when adding decorators
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0
```

The fix removes the extra empty lines when adding decorators by checking if the previous line is also a decorator and reducing the number of newlines accordingly. This change should ensure that the test case `test_comment_in_decorator` passes without affecting other tests.

Note that the fix is isolated to the `_maybe_empty_lines` function and does not require changes to other parts of the code.
