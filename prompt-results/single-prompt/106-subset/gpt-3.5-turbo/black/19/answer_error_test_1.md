To fix the bug in the code, we need to update the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. The issue seems to be with the counting of newlines in the `before` variable. The `before` variable should be incremented by the count of newlines in `first_leaf.prefix` only if it is not already greater than `max_allowed`. 

Here's the updated code:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        if before < max_allowed:
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = max_allowed
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0
```

This updated code checks if `before` is less than `max_allowed` before replacing the prefix of the first leaf. If `before` is already greater than or equal to `max_allowed`, it sets `before` to `max_allowed`.

This fixed code should resolve the bug and pass the failed test without affecting other successful tests.
