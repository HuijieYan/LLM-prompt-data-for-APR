The bug in the code is caused by trying to multiply a `None` value with an integer. To fix this bug, we need to check if `total` is `None` before performing the multiplication. If `total` is `None`, we can simply return `None` without any further calculations.

Here's the fixed code:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
