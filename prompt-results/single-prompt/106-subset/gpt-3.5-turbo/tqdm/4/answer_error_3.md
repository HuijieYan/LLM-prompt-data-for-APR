The issue in the code snippet is that the variable `total` is being multiplied by `unit_scale` when it is `None`, which causes a `TypeError`. To fix this issue, we can check if `total` is not `None` before performing the multiplication.

Here is the fixed code snippet:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    """
    Return a string-based progress bar given some parameters

    Parameters
