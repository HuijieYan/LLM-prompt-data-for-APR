The issue in the code is that when `unit_scale` is `True` and `total` is `None`, an error occurs because `total` cannot be multiplied by `unit_scale`. 

To fix this issue, we can modify the code as follows:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False
