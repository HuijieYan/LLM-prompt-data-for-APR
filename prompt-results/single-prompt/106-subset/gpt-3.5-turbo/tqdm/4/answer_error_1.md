The issue in the code is that the `total` variable is set to `None` in the `sanity check` if condition is met. Later, the code tries to multiply `total` with `unit_scale` which is an integer. This results in a `TypeError` as `None` can't be multiplied with an integer.

To fix this, we can modify the if condition to check if `total` is `None` and set it to `0` instead. This will ensure that the multiplication can be done without any errors. Here's the modified code:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols
