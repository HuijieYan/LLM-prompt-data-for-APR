The issue in the code is that when `unit_scale` is True and `total` is None, the program tries to multiply `total` with `unit_scale`, which raises a TypeError.

To fix this issue, you need to add a check before multiplying `total` with `unit_scale`. If `total` is not None, then perform the multiplication, otherwise, leave `total` unchanged.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii
