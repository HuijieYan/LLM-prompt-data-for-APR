The issue with the code is that the file object `self.file` is not being closed after it is opened. This is causing a `ResourceWarning` and the test failure.

To fix this issue, we can use the `with` statement to automatically close the file after it is opened. Here's the fixed code:

```python
def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
    self.file = None
    self.fingerprints = set()
    self.logdupes = True
    self.debug = debug
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    if path:
        with open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+') as file:
            self.file = file
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```

By using the `with` statement, the file will be automatically closed at the end of the block, eliminating the `ResourceWarning` and ensuring that the file is properly closed.

This fixed code can be easily applied to the original project by replacing the `__init__` method in the corresponding file with the fixed code.
