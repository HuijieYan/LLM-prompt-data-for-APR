The problem with the code is that the file is not being closed, which results in a `ResourceWarning`. To fix this, we can use a context manager (`with` statement) when opening the file. This will automatically close the file when we're done with it.

Here's the fixed code snippet:

```python
def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
    self.file = None
    self.fingerprints = set()
    self.logdupes = True
    self.debug = debug
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    if path:
        with open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+') as file:
            self.file = file
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```

By using the `with` statement, we ensure that the file is closed properly, even if an exception occurs. This should fix the `ResourceWarning` and allow the test to pass without affecting other successful tests.
