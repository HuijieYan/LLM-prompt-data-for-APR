The issue is that the file `requests.seen` is not being closed after it is opened in the `__init__` method. To fix this, you can use a `with` statement to automatically close the file when it's no longer needed.

Here's the fixed code:

```python
def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
    self.file = None
    self.fingerprints = set()
    self.logdupes = True
    self.debug = debug
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    if path:
        file_path = os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen')
        with open(file_path, 'a+') as file:
            self.file = file
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```

This code ensures that the file `requests.seen` will be closed properly, resolving the `ResourceWarning` and allowing the test to pass without affecting any other functionality.
