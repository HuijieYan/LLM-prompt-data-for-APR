The bug in the code is caused by the file not being closed properly after it is opened. To fix this, we need to ensure that the file is closed when it is no longer needed.

Here is the updated code snippet with the fix:

```python
def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
    self.file = None
    self.fingerprints = set()
    self.logdupes = True
    self.debug = debug
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    if path:
        self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
        self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
        self.file.close()
```

Explanation:

1. After opening the file, `self.fingerprints` is updated with the contents of the file.
2. After updating `self.fingerprints`, `self.file` is closed using the `close()` method.

This ensures that the file is properly closed after its contents are read.

By making this change, the test `test_dupefilter_path` should pass without any issues. Additionally, the fixed patch can be easily applied to the original project with minimal changes to the existing code.
