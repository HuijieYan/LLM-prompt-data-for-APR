The issue in the given code snippet is that the file object is not being closed after it is used, resulting in a ResourceWarning.

To fix this issue, we can utilize the `with` statement, which automatically ensures that the file is properly closed after it is used. Here's the updated code:

```python
def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
    self.file = None
    self.fingerprints = set()
    self.logdupes = True
    self.debug = debug
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    if path:
        with open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+') as file:
            self.file = file
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```

By using the `with` statement, the file object will be automatically closed when the code exits the `with` block, resolving the `ResourceWarning` issue.
