The bug in the code is that the file object `self.file` is not being closed after it is used. This leads to a `ResourceWarning` and causes the test to fail.

To fix this bug, we can use the `with` statement to open the file. The `with` statement ensures that the file is automatically closed when the block of code is exited.

Here's the fixed code snippet:

```python
def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
    self.file = None
    self.fingerprints = set()
    self.logdupes = True
    self.debug = debug
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    if path:
        with open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+') as file:
            self.file = file
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```

With this fixed code, the file will be closed automatically when the `with` block is exited, preventing the `ResourceWarning` and allowing the test to pass.
