Since the error message mentions an unclosed file, we need to ensure that the file is closed properly to avoid the ResourceWarning. To fix this, we can use the `with` statement to automatically handle closing the file. Here's the fixed code:

```python
def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
    self.file = None
    self.fingerprints = set()
    self.logdupes = True
    self.debug = debug
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    if path:
        with open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+') as file:
            self.file = file
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```

In this fixed code, we open the file in the `with` statement, assign it to the `self.file` attribute, and then update the fingerprints. The `with` statement automatically handles closing the file, even in the case of an exception.
