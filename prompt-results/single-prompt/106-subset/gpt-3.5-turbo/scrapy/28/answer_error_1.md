The issue in the code is that the file object is not being closed, which results in a `ResourceWarning` and prevents the test from passing.

To fix this issue, we can use the `with` statement to open the file, which will automatically close it when we are done with it. Here's the fixed code:

```python
def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
    self.file = None
    self.fingerprints = set()
    self.logdupes = True
    self.debug = debug
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    if path:
        with open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+') as file:
            self.file = file
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```

With this fix, the file will be properly closed after reading the contents, resolving the `ResourceWarning` and allowing the test to pass.
