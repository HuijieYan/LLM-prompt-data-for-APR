The bug in the code is that the file is not closed after it is opened. To fix this, we can use the `with` statement, which will automatically close the file when it goes out of scope. We can also simplify the code by removing the unnecessary `open` call and the `self.file` attribute.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
    self.fingerprints = set()
    self.logdupes = True
    self.debug = debug
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    if path:
        with open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+') as file:
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in file)
```

Now the file will be properly closed after it is opened, without affecting the rest of the code.
