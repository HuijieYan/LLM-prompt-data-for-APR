The issue with the original code is that it doesn't handle the case when the `requests.seen` file doesn't exist. This causes an error when trying to open the file in read mode. To fix this issue, we can modify the code to first check if the file exists before opening it.

Here's the fixed code:

```python
import os
import logging

class RFPDupeFilter:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path and os.path.exists(path):
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)

```

In the fixed code, we first import the `os` module to use the `os.path.exists()` function. Then, we modify the `__init__` method to check if the `path` exists before trying to open the file. If the `path` doesn't exist, the file won't be opened, and the code will continue without raising any errors.
