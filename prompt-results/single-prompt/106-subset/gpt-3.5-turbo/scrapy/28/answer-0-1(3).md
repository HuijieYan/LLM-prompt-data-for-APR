To fix the unclosed file issue and make the test pass, you need to close the file after reading its content. Here's the fixed code:

```python
def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
    self.file = None
    self.fingerprints = set()
    self.logdupes = True
    self.debug = debug
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    if path:
        self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
        self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
        self.file.close()
```

With this fix, the test should pass without any file-related errors.
