To fix the bug in the code, you need to ensure that the file opened in the `__init__` method is closed properly. To do this, you can make use of the `with` statement, which ensures that the file is closed automatically when the block is exited.

Here's the fixed code:

```python
import os
import logging

class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            filepath = os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen')
            with open(filepath, 'a+') as file:
                self.file = file
                self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```

By using the `with open(filepath, 'a+') as file` syntax, the file will be closed automatically when the `with` block is exited, even in the case of exceptions. This fixes the resource warning and ensures that the file is closed properly.

Please note that you need to import the `os` and `logging` modules at the beginning of the code.
