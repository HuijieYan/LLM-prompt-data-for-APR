The bug in the code is that the file that is opened in the `__init__` method is not being closed explicitly, causing a "ResourceWarning: unclosed file" error. To fix this, we need to add a `close()` method that will close the file.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
import logging
import os

class RFPDupeFilter:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.open(path)

    def open(self, path):
        self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
        self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)

    def close(self):
        if self.file:
            self.file.close()

    def request_seen(self, request):
        fp = request.url
        if fp in self.fingerprints:
            return True
        self.fingerprints.add(fp)
        if self.file:
            self.file.write(fp + os.linesep)

    def clear(self):
        self.fingerprints.clear()
```

Now the `open()` method opens the file, and the `close()` method is used to close the file explicitly. This fixed code will resolve the "unclosed file" error and ensure that the file is properly closed.
