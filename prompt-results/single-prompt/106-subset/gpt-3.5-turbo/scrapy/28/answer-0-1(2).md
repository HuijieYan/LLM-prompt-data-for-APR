The issue in the code is that the file object `self.file` is not being closed after it is opened. This is causing a `ResourceWarning` and the subsequent test failure.

To fix this issue, we can use the `with` statement to open the file. This ensures that the file object is automatically closed when we are done with it. 

Here's the fixed code:

```python
def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
    self.file = None
    self.fingerprints = set()
    self.logdupes = True
    self.debug = debug
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    if path:
        file_path = os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen')
        with open(file_path, 'a+') as file:
            self.file = file
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```

Now, the file will be properly closed after it is opened, avoiding the `ResourceWarning` and allowing the failed test to pass.
