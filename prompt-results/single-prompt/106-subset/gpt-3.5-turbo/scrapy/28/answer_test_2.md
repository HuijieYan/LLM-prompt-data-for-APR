The issue in the given code is that the file is not being closed after it is opened in the `__init__` method of the `RFPDupeFilter` class. This can lead to resource leaks and potential problems with file handling.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the file is always closed after it is opened. One way to do this is by using the `with` statement to open the file, which automatically takes care of closing the file for us.

Here is the fixed code snippet:

```python
def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
    self.file = None
    self.fingerprints = set()
    self.logdupes = True
    self.debug = debug
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    if path:
        with open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+') as file:
            self.file = file
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```

With this fix, the file will be automatically closed after it is opened and the program should pass the `test_dupefilter_path` test without any issues.
