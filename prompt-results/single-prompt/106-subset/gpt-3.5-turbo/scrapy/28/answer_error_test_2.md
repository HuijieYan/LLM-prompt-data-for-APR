The issue in the code is that the `open()` method is called to open a file, but the file object is not closed properly. This results in a ResourceWarning and can lead to unexpected behavior.

To fix this issue, you should use the `with` statement, which automatically closes the file object after the code block is executed. Here's the fixed code:

```python
def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
    self.file = None
    self.fingerprints = set()
    self.logdupes = True
    self.debug = debug
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    if path:
        with open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+') as file:
            self.file = file
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```

By using the `with` statement, the file will be closed automatically, eliminating the ResourceWarning and ensuring the proper handling of the file object.
