The issue in the code is that the file `self.file` is not being closed after it is opened in the `__init__` method. This is causing a resource warning and the subsequent test failure.

To fix this issue, we can introduce a `try...finally` block and close the file in the `finally` block to ensure that it is always closed, even if an exception is raised.

Here's the fixed code:

```python
import os
import logging

class ClassName:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        
        if path:
            try:
                self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
                self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
            finally:
                if self.file:
                    self.file.close()
```

By introducing the `try...finally` block and closing the file in the `finally` block, we ensure that the file is closed regardless of whether an exception is raised or not.

This fixed patch can be easily applied to the original project by replacing the `__init__` method in the original code with the fixed code provided above.
