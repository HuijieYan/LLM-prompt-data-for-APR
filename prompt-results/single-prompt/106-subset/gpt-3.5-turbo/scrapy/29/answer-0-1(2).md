The issue in the code is that `parsed.hostname` is `None` in the case of a non-HTTP request. In the original code, the `to_bytes` function is called on `parsed.hostname`, which causes a `TypeError` because `to_bytes` cannot handle a `None` value.

To fix this issue, we can modify the code to check for a `None` value before calling `to_bytes`. If `parsed.hostname` is `None`, we can replace it with an empty string before concatenating it with the other bytes.

Here's the fixed code:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname is None:
        s += b"Host: \r\n"
    else:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this fix, the `request_httprepr` function will now handle non-HTTP requests correctly, and the test case will pass without any errors.
