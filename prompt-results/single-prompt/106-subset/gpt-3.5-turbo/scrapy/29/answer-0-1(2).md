The bug in the code is due to the `parsed.hostname` value being `None` in the case of non-http requests. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to concatenate it with the `b"Host: "` string.

To fix this bug, we can check if `parsed.hostname` is `None` and handle it accordingly. We can replace the line:

```python
s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
```

with:

```python
if parsed.hostname:
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
```

Here's the fixed code:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

Now the `request_httprepr` function should handle non-http requests without causing an error. The test case should pass without any errors.
