Here is the fixed code:

```python
from six.moves.urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request.url) # Use urlparse instead of urlparse_cached
    path = urlunparse(('','',parsed.path or '/','','','')) # Use tuple instead of named arguments in urlunparse
    s = request.method.encode() + b" " + path.encode() + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n" # Use encode() instead of to_bytes
    s += b"Host: " + parsed.hostname.encode() + b"\r\n" # Use encode() instead of to_bytes
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string().encode() + b"\r\n" # Use encode() instead of to_bytes
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

The issue was with the `to_bytes()` function, which was expecting a Unicode, str, or bytes object but got a NoneType object instead. To fix this, I replaced the `to_bytes()` function with the `encode()` method, which converts the string to bytes using the specified encoding.

I also made some other changes to fix potential issues. I imported the `urlparse` and `urlunparse` functions from `six.moves.urllib.parse` module to ensure compatibility across different Python versions. I used the `urlparse` function instead of `urlparse_cached` for parsing the URL. I passed a tuple of empty strings to `urlunparse` instead of named arguments. And I used the `encode()` method instead of the `to_bytes()` function to convert strings to bytes.

With these changes, the `test_request_httprepr_for_non_http_request` test should pass without any errors.
