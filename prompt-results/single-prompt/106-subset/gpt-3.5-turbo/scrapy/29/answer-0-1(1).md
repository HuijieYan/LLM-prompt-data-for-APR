To fix the bug in the `request_httprepr` function, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None`. Currently, the code is trying to convert `parsed.hostname` to bytes using the `to_bytes` function, which raises a `TypeError` when `parsed.hostname` is `None`.

We can fix this bug by providing a default value for `parsed.hostname` in case it is `None`. We can use the empty string `''` as the default value.

Here's the fixed code snippet:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request)
    path = parsed.path or '/'
    s = f"{request.method} {path} HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += f"Host: {parsed.hostname or ''}\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

After applying this fix, the code should pass the failing test without affecting other successful tests.
