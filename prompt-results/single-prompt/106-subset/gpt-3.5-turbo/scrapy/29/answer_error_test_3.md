To fix the bug in the `request_httprepr` function, we need to handle the case where the `parsed.hostname` is `None`. Currently, the code tries to concatenate `parsed.hostname` with the "Host: " string, which raises a `TypeError` when `parsed.hostname` is `None`.

We can fix this by checking if `parsed.hostname` is `None` before concatenating it with the string. If it is `None`, we can use an empty bytes object instead. 

Here's the fixed code:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request)
    path = parsed.path or '/'
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname or b"") + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

This fix handles the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` by using an empty bytes object as a replacement. This ensures that the code won't raise a `TypeError` and allows the test to pass without affecting other successful tests.

You can apply this fixed code directly to the original project by replacing the existing `request_httprepr` function with the fixed code snippet provided above.
