To fix the bug in the `request_httprepr` function, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None`. Currently, the function tries to concatenate `b"Host: "` with `to_bytes(parsed.hostname)`, which raises a `TypeError` when `parsed.hostname` is `None`.

Here's the fixed version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    # Check if parsed.hostname is not None before concatenating
    if parsed.hostname is not None:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
        
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

The change made is only to add a check `if parsed.hostname is not None` before concatenating `b"Host: "` with `to_bytes(parsed.hostname)`. This ensures that if `parsed.hostname` is `None`, the host header is not included in the return value.

This fix allows the `test_request_httprepr_for_non_http_request` test to pass without affecting other tests.
