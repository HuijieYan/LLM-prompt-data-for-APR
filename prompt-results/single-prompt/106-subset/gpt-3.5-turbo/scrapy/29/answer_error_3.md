    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params or '', parsed.query or '', ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname or '') + b"\r\n"

```
The issue in the original code is that `parsed.hostname` can be `None`, which is causing the `TypeError` when trying to convert it to bytes using the `to_bytes` function.

To fix this issue, I have modified the code to use the `or` operator to provide a default value of an empty string `''` when `parsed.hostname` is `None`. This ensures that a valid object of type `str` is passed to the `to_bytes` function and prevents the `TypeError`.

Additionally, I have added similar default values for `parsed.params` and `parsed.query` to handle `None` values if they occur.

This fixed code snippet should resolve the `TypeError` and allow the test to pass successfully.
