Explanation: 

In the original code, the `parsed.hostname` attribute is directly concatenated with `b"Host: "` and passed to the `to_bytes()` function, which causes the `TypeError` when `parsed.hostname` is `None`. 

To fix this bug, we can add a check to ensure that `parsed.hostname` is not empty before concatenating it with `b"Host: "`. By doing this, we avoid passing a `NoneType` into the `to_bytes()` function.
