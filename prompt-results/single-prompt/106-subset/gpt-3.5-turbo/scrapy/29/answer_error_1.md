Explanation:
- The bug occurs when `parsed.hostname` is None, and then `to_bytes` raises a TypeError when trying to convert it to bytes.
- To fix the bug, we need to add a check for None before converting `parsed.hostname` to bytes.
- In the fixed code, we add a condition `if parsed.hostname is not None:` to only execute the next line if `parsed.hostname` is not None.
- The fixed code ensures that the `to_bytes(parsed.hostname)` is only called when `parsed.hostname` is a string or bytes object, avoiding the TypeError.
