There seems to be a bug in the `request_httprepr` function that causes it to fail for non-HTTP requests. 

To fix this bug, we need to update the function to handle non-HTTP requests as well. To do this, we'll add a condition to check if the parsed URL scheme is either `http` or `https` before constructing the HTTP representation.

Here's the fixed code:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    if parsed.scheme in ['http', 'https']:
        path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
        s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
        if request.headers:
            s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
        s += b"\r\n"
        s += request.body
        return s
    else:
        # Handle non-HTTP requests
        return b""
```

With this fix, the `request_httprepr` function will now return an empty byte string for non-HTTP requests, allowing the test case to pass without affecting other successful tests.
