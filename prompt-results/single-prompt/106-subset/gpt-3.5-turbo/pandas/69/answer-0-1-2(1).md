The issue in the code is that the `key` is not being converted to a list in the `_convert_key` method when `is_setter` is `False`. This causes a `ValueError` to be raised when checking the type of the indexers.

To fix this issue, you can modify the `_convert_key` method to always convert `key` to a list. Here's the fixed code:

```python
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):
    _takeable = False

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # always convert key to list
        key = list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

By making this change, the code should pass the failing test cases without affecting other successful tests. I hope this helps!
