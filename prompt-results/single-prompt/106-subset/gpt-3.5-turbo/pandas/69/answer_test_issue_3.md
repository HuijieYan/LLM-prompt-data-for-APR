Here is the fixed code snippet with minimal changes to the original source code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

Explanation:

The bug in the original code is that it checks if the indexer `i` is an integer using the `is_integer()` method, which is incorrect. The `is_integer()` method checks if the index itself is an integer, not the indexer value. To fix this, we need to use the `isinstance()` function to check if the indexer `i` is an instance of the `int` class.

I have made changes to the original code by replacing `is_integer()` with `isinstance(i, int)` in the appropriate places. This ensures that the check is correctly performed and the correct error is raised when necessary.
