Explanation: 
The issue arises when an "At based indexing" operation is performed on a Float64Index. The `_convert_key` method is responsible for validating the key used for indexing. Currently, it checks whether the key is an integer or non-integer based on the axis of the index. However, it does not handle the case when the key is an integer but the index axis holds non-integer values.

To fix the issue, we need to modify the `_convert_key` method to include a check for this case. If the key is an integer and the index axis holds non-integer values, a `ValueError` should be raised.

With the proposed fix, the method will correctly handle the scenario and pass the failing test without affecting other successful tests.
