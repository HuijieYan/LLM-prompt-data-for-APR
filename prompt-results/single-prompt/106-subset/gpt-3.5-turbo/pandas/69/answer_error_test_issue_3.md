The bug in the code is that the `at` method in the `_AtIndexer` class is raising a `ValueError` when indexing with an integer. This is incorrect behavior as the `at` method should be able to accept both integer and float indexers.

To fix this, we can modify the `_AtIndexer._convert_key` method to handle integer indexers when the axis is not an integer. We can use the `float` function to convert the integer indexers to float.

Here's the fixed code:

```python
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):
    _takeable = False

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require the keys to be the same type as the index (so we don't fallback).
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                    i = float(i)
            return key
```

With this fix, the program should pass the failed test without affecting other successful tests. The fixed patch can be easily applied to the original project.
