Explanation:
In the given code snippet, the bug is caused by using the `is_integer()` method to check if the key is an integer. However, this method does not exist in Python.
To fix this bug, we can use the `isinstance()` function to check if the key is of type `int`. The `isinstance()` function returns `True` if the object is an instance of the specified type, otherwise it returns `False`.
So, I have replaced `ax.is_integer()` with `isinstance(i, int)` in both if conditions to check if the key is an integer. This fix ensures that the program passes the test case without affecting other successful tests.
