To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` method in the `_AtIndexer` class. The issue occurs when indexing with a non-integer key on a non-integer index. We can replace the erroneous if condition with a corrected one. Instead of checking if the key is an integer, we should check if it can be converted to an integer. Here's the fixed code:

```python
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):
    _takeable = False

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if not is_integer(i) and ax.holds_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                        "can only have non-integer indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

With this fix, the program should pass the failing tests without affecting other successful tests.
