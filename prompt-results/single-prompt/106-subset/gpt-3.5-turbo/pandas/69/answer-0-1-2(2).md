The bug in the code lies in the `_convert_key` method of the `_AtIndexer` class. It is throwing a `ValueError` when trying to access the value in `ser.at[4]` because the index is of type `float`, but the indexer is of type `int`.

To fix this bug, you can modify the `_convert_key` method to handle the case where the index is of type `float` and the indexer is of type `int` by converting the indexer to `float`. This will ensure that the indexing operation works correctly.

Here's the fixed code:

```python
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):
    _takeable = False

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        
        # Convert indexer to float if index is float
        if isinstance(key, tuple) and isinstance(self.obj.index, pd.Float64Index):
            key = tuple(float(i) for i in key)
        
        return key
```

Now the modified code will handle the case where the index is of type `float` and the indexer is of type `int` by converting the indexer to `float`.
