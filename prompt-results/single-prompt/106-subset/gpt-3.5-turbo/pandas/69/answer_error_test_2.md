Explanation:
- The bug occurs when indexing the `at` method with non-integer indexers.
- The fix is to convert the non-integer indexers to float if the index is float.
- This can be achieved by adding an additional step after checking for non-integer indexers.
- The fix allows the program to pass the failed test without affecting other successful tests.
- The patch can be easily applied to the original project by replacing the code in the `_convert_key` method.
