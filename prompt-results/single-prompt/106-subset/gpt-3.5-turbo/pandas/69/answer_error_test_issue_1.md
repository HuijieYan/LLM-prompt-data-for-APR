The issue in the code is that in the `_convert_key` method of the `_AtIndexer` class, there is a check to ensure that the index values are of the same type as the index. However, the check for non-integer index values is incorrect.

To fix this issue, we need to update the `_convert_key` method to correctly check for non-integer index values. Here is the fixed code:

```python
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):
    _takeable = False

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require the keys to be the same type as the index (so we don't fallback).
        """
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer() and not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
            elif not ax.is_integer() and not isinstance(i, (int, float)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
        
        return key
```

The changes made are:
- In the `for` loop, the condition for checking non-integer index values has been updated to `not ax.is_integer() and not isinstance(i, (int, float))`.
- The error message has been updated to reflect the correct condition.

With this fix, the program should pass the failed test without affecting other successful tests.
