The issue is that the `_convert_key` function in the `indexing.py` file is raising a `ValueError` when an integer index is used with a non-integer indexer. To fix this issue, we can modify the `_convert_key` function to handle integer and non-integer indexes separately. I have provided the fixed code snippet below:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        elif not is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```

With this fixed code, the program should pass the failed test without affecting other successful tests. The fix involves modifying only the `_convert_key` function, so it can be easily applied to the original project by replacing the existing `_convert_key` function code with the fixed code snippet provided above.
