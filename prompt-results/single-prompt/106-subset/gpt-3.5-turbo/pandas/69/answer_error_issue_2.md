Based on the error message and the raised issue description, it seems that the bug is related to the `get_value` method in the `Float64Index` class. The bug occurs when using the `at` indexer with a non-integer index.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `_convert_key` method in the `_AtIndexer` class to handle both integer and non-integer indexers correctly. We can use the `float` function to convert all indexers to floats before performing the comparison. This will ensure that non-integer indexers are allowed for non-integer indexes.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):
    _takeable = False

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        converted_key = []
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
                converted_key.append(float(i))
            else:
                converted_key.append(float(i))

        return tuple(converted_key)
```

With this fix, the program should pass the failed test without affecting other successful tests. Additionally, the fixed code can be easily applied as a patch to the original project.
