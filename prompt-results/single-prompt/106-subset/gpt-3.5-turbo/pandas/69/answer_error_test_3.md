The issue in the code is that the `_convert_key` function raises a `ValueError` when the value of `is_setter` is `False` and the key contains a non-integer value for an index that requires non-integer indexers. To fix this issue, we need to replace the `is_integer` function with the `is_floating` function and update the error messages in the `ValueError` exceptions.

Here's the fixed code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index (so we don't fallback).
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_floating():
            if not is_floating(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a floating index can only have floating indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_floating(i) and not ax.holds_floating():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-floating index can only have non-floating indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this fix, the code should pass the failed test without affecting other successful tests.
