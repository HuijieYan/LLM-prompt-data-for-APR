To fix the bug, we need to replace the `DatetimeArray` class with `TimedeltaArray` class in the `__rsub__` function of the given code.

Here is the fixed code snippet:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        # ndarray[datetime64] cannot be subtracted from self, so
        # we need to wrap in DatetimeArray/Index and flip the operation
        from pandas.core.arrays import TimedeltaArray

        if not isinstance(other, DatetimeLikeArrayMixin):
            # Avoid down-casting DatetimeIndex
            other = TimedeltaArray(other)
        return other - self
    # ... rest of the code ...
```

Explanation:
- In the original code, the `DatetimeArray` class is imported and used. However, the error message suggests that the `TimedeltaArray` class should be used instead.
- So, we simply replaced `DatetimeArray` with `TimedeltaArray` in the import statement and in the code block where it is used.

The fixed code replaces the incorrect usage of `DatetimeArray` with the correct `TimedeltaArray` class, ensuring that the subtraction operation between `TimedeltaArray` and `np.datetime64` objects works as expected.
