The issue is raised when subtracting a `TimedeltaArray` from a `datetime64` object. The `__rsub__` method is trying to convert the `datetime64` object to a `DatetimeArray` using the line `other = DatetimeArray(other)`. However, this conversion is failing because the `other` variable is of type `datetime64`, which is not expected by the `DatetimeArray` constructor.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `__rsub__` method to check for `datetime64` objects and wrap them in a `DatetimeArray` only if necessary. Here is the fixed code:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        # ndarray[datetime64] cannot be subtracted from self, so
        # we need to wrap in DatetimeArray/Index and flip the operation
        if not isinstance(other, DatetimeLikeArrayMixin):
            # Avoid down-casting DatetimeIndex
            from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray

            if not isinstance(other, np.ndarray):  # Add check for datetime64 object
                other = DatetimeArray(other)
        return other - self
    # Rest of the code remains the same

    ...
```

With this modification, the `__rsub__` method will only convert `other` to a `DatetimeArray` if it is not already an `ndarray` or `DatetimeArray`.

This fix should resolve the issue and allow the failing test to pass.
