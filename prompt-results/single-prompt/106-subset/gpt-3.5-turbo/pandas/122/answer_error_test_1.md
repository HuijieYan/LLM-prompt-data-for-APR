To fix the bug in the `equals` method, we need to update the code that compares the column values of two dataframes. Currently, it is comparing them using the `equals` method of the column. However, for the test case where the column values are of different types, this will always be `False` and the test will fail.

To fix this, we can modify the code to use the `np.array_equal` function to compare the column values instead. This will ensure that the comparison is done based on the actual values in the columns, allowing for comparison of columns with different types.

Here's the fixed code:

```python
import numpy as np

def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(np.array_equal(ax1, ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this update, the `equals` method should now correctly compare the two dataframes and pass the test case without affecting other test cases.
