The issue is caused by the use of the `_consolidate_inplace` method before checking the equality of the blocks. This method modifies the DataFrame inplace and may change the order and location of the blocks, leading to incorrect equality comparison.

To fix this issue, we can create a deep copy of the DataFrames before calling the `_consolidate_inplace` method. This way, the original DataFrames are not modified and the equality check is performed on the original blocks.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
import copy

def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self_copy = copy.deepcopy(self)
    other_copy = copy.deepcopy(other)
    
    self_copy._consolidate_inplace()
    other_copy._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self_copy.blocks) != len(other_copy.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self_copy.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other_copy.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The code creates deep copies of `self` and `other` using the `copy.deepcopy` method. These copies are then used to call the `_consolidate_inplace` method, ensuring that the original DataFrames are not modified. The rest of the code remains the same.

With this fix, the program should pass the failed test without affecting other successful tests, and the fixed patch can be easily applied to the original project.
