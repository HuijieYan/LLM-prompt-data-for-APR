Based on the error message and the description, the bug is in the `equals` method of the `DataFrame` class. The method is not comparing the blocks correctly, causing it to return `True` instead of `False` when the blocks have different locations.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks. Currently, it uses `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` for sorting. We can replace this line with `hash(block.mgr_locs)` to create a hash of the block locations. This change will ensure that blocks with different locations are correctly distinguished.

Here's the fixed code snippet:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # modified canonicalize function
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, hash(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this replacement, the `equals` method should now correctly compare the blocks of the `DataFrame` objects and return `False` when the blocks have different locations. This fix should resolve the bug in the code and make the failing test pass.
