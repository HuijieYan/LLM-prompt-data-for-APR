To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function. Currently, it is using the block's `mgr_locs` attribute, which can change if blocks are consolidated. We need to replace it with a more reliable attribute that uniquely identifies each block.

Here's the fixed code:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # modify canonicalize block order, using the hash value of the block
    def canonicalize(block):
        return hash(block.values.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Explanation:
The fix modifies the `canonicalize` function to return the hash value of the block's values. This value is computed from the bytes representation of the block's values and is guaranteed to be consistent even if blocks are consolidated. By using the hash value, we can uniquely identify each block and ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not treated as equal.

With this fix, the `equals` function should return the correct result when comparing `df1` and `df2` in the test case, and it will return `False` as expected.
