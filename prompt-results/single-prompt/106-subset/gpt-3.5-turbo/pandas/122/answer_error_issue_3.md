The bug in the code is that the `equals` method of the `DataFrame` class is returning `True` instead of `False` when comparing two dataframes `df1` and `df2` that have identical blocks with different locations. 

To fix the bug, I will modify the `canonicalize` function by adding an extra check for the block's location. This will ensure that two blocks are only considered equal if they have the same type, dtype name, and mgr_locs.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, dtype name, and mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The fix modifies the `canonicalize` function to include the type name (obtained using `type(block).__name__`) and the dtype name of the block. This will ensure that blocks with the same type and dtype are sorted together. Additionally, we include the `mgr_locs` of the block in the tuple to distinguish blocks with different locations.

Now, the modified `equals` method should return the correct result and the failing test should pass.
