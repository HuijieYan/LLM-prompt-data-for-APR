The bug in the code is that the `equals` method is not correctly implementing the comparison of the DataFrame blocks. It is using the `equals` method of each block, but due to the unconsolidated blocks, the order of the blocks might be different between the two DataFrames, causing incorrect results.

To fix this issue, I would suggest using the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class instead of comparing each block individually. This method checks the equality of all blocks in a consolidated manner.

Here is the updated code:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return self_blocks.equals(other_blocks)
```

With this update, the `equals` method should correctly compare the blocks of the two DataFrames and return the expected results.
