The issue with the code is that it doesn't handle the case where the DataFrame blocks have the same content but different locations. To fix this, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to include the block's content in the tuple used for sorting.

Here's the modified code:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, the block's content and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values.tolist(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the `canonicalize` function includes the block's content (`block.values.tolist()`) along with its dtype name and mgr_locs for sorting. This ensures that the blocks with the same content but different locations are treated differently during equality comparison.

Now the code should pass the failing test and return the expected output.
