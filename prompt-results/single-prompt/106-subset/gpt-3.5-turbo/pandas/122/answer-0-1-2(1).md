The bug in the code is that the `equals` method is incorrectly returning True when comparing two DataFrames (`df1` and `df2`) that have different values. To fix this issue, we can update the `equals` method as follows:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_dtype_counts().items(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This updated code uses the `get_dtype_counts()` method to retrieve the data types and their counts for each block. This information is then used as part of the canonicalization process, along with the `mgr_locs` attribute, to ensure that blocks with different values are properly distinguished.

With this patch, the `df1.equals(df2)` comparison in the test case will correctly return False, resolving the bug.
