The issue seems to be with the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks. The sorting is done based on a tuple of the dtype name and `mgr_locs` converted to a list. However, `mgr_locs` is a property of the blocks object, and it might not be available in the blocks of both dataframes.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to handle cases where `mgr_locs` is not available in one of the blocks. We can use a fallback value, such as an empty list, in such cases.

Here's the fixed code:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        dtype_name = block.dtype.name
        mgr_locs = getattr(block, 'mgr_locs', [])
        mgr_locs_list = mgr_locs.as_array.tolist() if mgr_locs else []
        return (dtype_name, mgr_locs_list)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this fix, the `equals` function should correctly compare the dataframes and return `False` for the provided test case. The fix also ensures that the code can be easily applied to the original project without affecting other successful tests.
