To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, we need to replace the `weakref.ref` call with `weakref.proxy` to pass a weak reference to the `_engine_type`. Here's the fixed code:

```python
import weakref

def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref.proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By replacing `weakref.ref` with `weakref.proxy`, we are now passing a weak reference (`weakref.proxy` object) of `self` to `_engine_type` instead of a weak reference (`weakref.ref` object). This should resolve the `AttributeError` that was occurring during the test.
