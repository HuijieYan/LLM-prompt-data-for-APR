The issue in the code arises from the fact that the `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to pass a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`. However, the `_engine_type` argument in the original code snippet is not defined, which causes the AttributeError in the test.

To fix this issue without making substantial changes to the code, we can modify the `_engine` function to directly return the `_engine_type` argument, which appears to be the intended behavior based on the code and the test.

Here's the fixed code:

```python
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type
```

By making this change, the code should pass the failing test while preserving the original functionality.
