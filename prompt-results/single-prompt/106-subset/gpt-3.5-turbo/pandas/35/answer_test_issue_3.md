The issue in the code is that the `_engine` method is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self` and then passing it to `_engine_type`. However, the `weakref.ref` creates a weak reference object, not a reference to `self` itself. Therefore, `_engine_type` is receiving the weak reference object instead of `self`.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `_engine` method to directly pass `self` to `_engine_type` instead of using `weakref.ref`.

Here's the fixed code:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

Now, when the `self` object is passed to `_engine_type`, it will correctly receive the reference to `self` instead of a weak reference object. This fix ensures that the `PeriodEngine` receives the `PeriodIndex` object as intended.
