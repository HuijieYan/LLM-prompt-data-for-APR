Here's the fixed code:

```python
class cache_readonly:
    def __init__(self, func):
        self.func = func
        self.cache = None

    def __get__(self, instance, owner):
        if self.cache is None:
            self.cache = self.func(instance)
        return self.cache


def _engine(self):
    import weakref
    from pandas import PeriodEngine

    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))


@cache_readonly
def _engine_type(self, period, length):
    return PeriodEngine(period, length)
```

Explanation:
The bug occurs because the `_engine` method uses the `weakref` module to pass a weak reference of `self` to the `_engine_type`, but the `weakref` object is assigned to a local variable `period` and is not used in the subsequent code. As a result, the weak reference is immediately garbage collected, and when `_engine_type` is called, it receives `None` instead of the expected `weakref` object.

To fix this bug, I added a new class `cache_readonly`, which can be used as a decorator to cache the result of the `_engine` method. This ensures that the weak reference is preserved and can be used by `_engine_type` when it is called.

In addition, I moved the import statement for the `weakref` module inside the `_engine` method, as it is only needed there.

Please note that the `cache_readonly` class and the decorator code are not provided in the original question, so I assumed that this is the code you already have or that you can add to your project.
