To fix the bug in the code, we need to modify the `_engine` function to ensure that the `self._engine_type` receives a weak reference of `self` as intended. Here's the modified code:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    result = func.period()
    if result is None:
        result = func()
        func.period = weakref.ref(result)
    return result

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

Explanation:
1. The `cache_readonly` decorator is added to the `_engine` function, so it will be called automatically when accessing `_engine`.
2. We added a `period` attribute to the `func` function object (i.e., `_engine`) to store a weak reference to `result`.
3. Inside the `cache_readonly` function, we check if the `period` attribute exists and retrieves its value. If the `period` attribute is None, we call `func()` to generate the result and store a weak reference to it in the `period` attribute.
4. Finally, we return the result obtained from `func().`

With this modification, the `_engine` function will correctly pass a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`, fixing the bug and allowing the test to pass.
