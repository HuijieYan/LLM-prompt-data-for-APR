The bug in the code is caused by the weak reference (`weakref.ref(self)`) being passed as an argument to the `_engine_type` function. The weak reference is being dropped prematurely, causing the `_engine_type` function to receive `None` instead of the intended reference.

To fix this bug, we can modify the code to store the weak reference as a local variable before passing it to the `_engine_type` function. This will ensure that the weak reference is kept until after the function call.

Here's the fixed code:

```python
import weakref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type
    return engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By assigning `self._engine_type` to the `engine_type` variable, we prevent the premature deletion of the weak reference. Then, when calling `engine_type`, we use `period()` instead of `period` to obtain the actual reference.

After applying this fix, the program should pass the failed test without affecting other successful tests.
