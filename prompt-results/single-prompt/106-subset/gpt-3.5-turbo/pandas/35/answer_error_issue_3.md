To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_engine` method to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until the `_engine_type` is called.

Here is the modified code snippet:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    def inner_func(self):
        if not hasattr(self, "_cache"):
            self._cache = {}
        if func.__name__ not in self._cache:
            self._cache[func.__name__] = func(self)
        return self._cache[func.__name__]
    return inner_func
    
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

Explanation:
- We define a decorator `cache_readonly` to cache the result of the `_engine` function.
- Within the decorator, we check if the result is already cached and return it if available.
- If the result is not cached, we calculate it by calling the original `_engine` function (`func(self)`) and store it in the cache.
- We use `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` and pass it as an argument to `_engine_type`.
- `period()` is called to retrieve the object from the weak reference and pass it as the correct argument type to `_engine_type`.

By maintaining a weak reference to `self` until `_engine_type` is called, we ensure that the reference cycle is avoided and the `_engine` function works as expected.

This fix should resolve the `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` error and allow the test to pass successfully without affecting other tests.
