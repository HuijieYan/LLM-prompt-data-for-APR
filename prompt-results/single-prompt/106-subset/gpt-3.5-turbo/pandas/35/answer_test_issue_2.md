The bug in the code snippet is that the `_engine` method is decorated with `cache_readonly`, but the decorator itself is not provided in the code snippet.

To fix this bug, we can use the `functools.lru_cache` decorator as a replacement for the `cache_readonly` decorator. This will ensure that the `_engine` method is cached and its result is returned without recomputation.

Here's the fixed code snippet:

```python
import weakref
from functools import lru_cache

class MyClass:
    @property
    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))

def test_get_level_values_when_periods():
    # GH33131. See also discussion in GH32669.
    # This test can probably be removed when PeriodIndex._engine is removed.
    from pandas import Period, PeriodIndex, MultiIndex

    idx = MultiIndex.from_arrays(
        [PeriodIndex([Period("2019Q1"), Period("2019Q2")], name="b")]
    )
    idx2 = MultiIndex.from_arrays(
        [idx._get_level_values(level) for level in range(idx.nlevels)]
    )
    assert all(x.is_monotonic for x in idx2.levels)
```

In the fixed code, we import the `lru_cache` decorator from the `functools` module and apply it as a decorator to the `_engine` method. This ensures that the method's result is cached and retrieved from the cache when the method is called again.

Now, when we run the `test_get_level_values_when_periods` test, it should pass without raising an error, and the output should be `True` as expected.
