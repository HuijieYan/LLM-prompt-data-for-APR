To fix the bug, we need to replace the `cache_readonly` decorator with the `property` decorator. This change will allow us to compute the `_engine` attribute dynamically whenever it is accessed. Additionally, we need to modify the `_engine` method to directly return the `_engine_type` attribute without using the weak reference.

Here's the fixed code snippet:

```python
@property
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By making this change, the program should pass the failed test without affecting other successful tests.
