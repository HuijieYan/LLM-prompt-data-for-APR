To fix the bug in the `_engine` method, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly passed to `_engine_type`. Additionally, we need to handle the case where `_engine_type` returns `None`. Here's the fixed code:

```python
from weakref import ref

def cache_readonly(func):
    def wrapper(self):
        if not hasattr(self, "_engine"):
            self._engine = ref(func(self), self._engine_destructor)
        return self._engine()
    return wrapper

def _engine_destructor(self, ref):
    if self._engine is ref:
        del self._engine

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("_engine_type returned None")
    return engine
```

This fix ensures that the weak reference is correctly passed to `_engine_type` and handles the case where `None` is returned. It also defines a `_engine_destructor` function to handle the cleanup when the weak reference is no longer needed.

After applying this fix, the `test_get_level_values_when_periods` test should pass without the `AttributeError`.
