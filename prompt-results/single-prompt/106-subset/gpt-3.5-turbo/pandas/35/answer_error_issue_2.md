To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_engine` method to ensure that the `weakref` of `self` is passed to `_engine_type`. Additionally, we need to ensure that the `weakref` does not get garbage collected by assigning it to a variable outside the method.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
import weakref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self) # Assigning the weakref to a variable outside the method
    return self._engine_type(period_ref(), len(self)) # Passing the weakref()

```

By assigning `weakref.ref(self)` to `period_ref` outside the method, we ensure that the `weakref` is not garbage collected before it is passed to `_engine_type`.

Now the modified code should pass the test successfully without affecting other tests.
