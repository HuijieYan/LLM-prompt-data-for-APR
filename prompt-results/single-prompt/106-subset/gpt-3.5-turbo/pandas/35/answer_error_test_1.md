To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, we need to modify the implementation of the `@cache_readonly` decorator. The existing implementation is causing an `AttributeError` because the `_engine_type` method is returning `None` instead of the expected result.

Here's the fixed code:

```python
def cache_readonly(func):
    attr_name = f'_{func.__name__}'

    @property
    def wrapper(self):
        if getattr(self, attr_name, None) is None:
            setattr(self, attr_name, func(self))
        return getattr(self, attr_name)

    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this modification, the `_engine` method will only be called once, and the result will be cached. This ensures that the function does not cause a reference cycle and correctly returns the expected result.

Please note that this is a general fix for the `_engine` function based on the information provided. It may not resolve all possible issues or cover all edge cases. Further testing and debugging might be required in the actual project context.
