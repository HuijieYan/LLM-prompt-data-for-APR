To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, you can replace the `weakref.ref(self)` line with `weakref.proxy(self)`. This will ensure that a weak reference to `self` is passed to `_engine_type`.

Here is the updated code snippet:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref.proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This fix should address the `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` error that occurred during the test execution.
