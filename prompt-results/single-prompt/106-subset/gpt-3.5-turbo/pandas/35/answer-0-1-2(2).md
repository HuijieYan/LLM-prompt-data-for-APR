To fix the bug in the code, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `self` object is preserved until it is used to instantiate `_engine_type`. This can be achieved by storing the weak reference as an attribute of the `self` object.

Here's the fixed code with minimal alterations:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    def wrapper(self):
        cache_attr = "_{}_cache".format(func.__name__)
        if not hasattr(self, cache_attr):
            setattr(self, cache_attr, func(self))
        return getattr(self, cache_attr)

    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    if not hasattr(self, "_weak_self"):
        self._weak_self = weakref.ref(self)
    period = self._weak_self()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This fix creates a `_weak_self` attribute on the `self` object and stores the weak reference to `self` in it. This way, the weak reference is preserved until it is used to instantiate `_engine_type`.

With this fix applied, the code should pass the test case without affecting other tests.
