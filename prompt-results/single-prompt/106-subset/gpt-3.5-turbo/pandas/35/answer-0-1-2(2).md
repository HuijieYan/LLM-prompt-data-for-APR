The issue is occurring because the `PeriodIndex` is being passed as a weak reference to the `_engine_type` function, but the weak reference is being dropped before it should. To fix this bug, we can modify the `_engine` function to store the weak reference as a member variable of the class instance, so that it is not garbage collected prematurely.

Here's the fixed code:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    def wrapper(self):
        if not hasattr(self, '_engine_weakref'):
            # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
            self._engine_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
        return func(self)
    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = self._engine_weakref()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

Explanation:
- We modified the `@cache_readonly` decorator function to store the weak reference as a member variable called `_engine_weakref` of the class instance.
- Inside the `wrapper` function, we first check if the `_engine_weakref` attribute exists on the class instance. If it doesn't, we create it and assign it the value of the weak reference of `self`.
- Finally, we return the result of executing the original `_engine` function.

With this fix, the `_engine` function will always return a valid weak reference to `self`, preventing the issue of the weak reference being garbage collected prematurely.
