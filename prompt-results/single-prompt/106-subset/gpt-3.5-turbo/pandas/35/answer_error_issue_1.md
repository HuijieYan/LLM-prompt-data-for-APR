To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_engine` method to ensure that the weakref is used correctly and passed to `_engine_type`.

Here's the fixed code:

```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

Explanation:

In the original code, the `_engine` method is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference of `self`, but it is not correctly accessing the object from the weak reference. By calling `weakref.ref(self)()`, we are accessing the object referenced by the weak reference.

This fix ensures that the `period` variable is assigned the object referenced by the weak reference, and then it is passed to `_engine_type` as intended.

With this fix, the program should pass the test without affecting other successful tests.
