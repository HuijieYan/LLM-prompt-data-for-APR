To fix the bug, you can replace the `weakref.ref` with `weakref.proxy` in the `_engine` function. This will create a proxy object that allows access to the original object without keeping a strong reference.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    # ... decorator implementation here ...

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref.proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This fix replaces the usage of `weakref.ref` with `weakref.proxy` to create the weak reference to `self` in the `_engine` function.

Since this is a minimal change to the source code, it should not affect any other tests or functionality of the program. The fixed patch can be easily applied to the original project by replacing the `_engine` function with the fixed code snippet provided above.
