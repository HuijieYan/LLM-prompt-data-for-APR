Since the specific issue is related to a weak reference, we can fix it by using the `WeakValueDictionary` class from the `weakref` module. This class allows us to create a dictionary that holds weak references to objects, ensuring that the objects can be garbage collected when no longer needed.

Here's the fixed code snippet:

```python
from weakref import WeakValueDictionary

def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = WeakValueDictionary({0: self})
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In this code, we create a `WeakValueDictionary` object `period` and store the weak reference of `self` using a key of 0. Then, we pass `period` as an argument to `_engine_type`, ensuring that the weak reference is preserved.

By using `WeakValueDictionary`, we ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained correctly, resolving the issue with the `NoneType` error.

This fix can be easily applied to the original project by replacing the existing code with the above snippet in the relevant file.
