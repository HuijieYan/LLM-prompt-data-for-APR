To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_engine` method to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly passed to `_engine_type`. Additionally, we need to handle the case when the weak reference becomes `None`. 

Here is the modified code:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(fn):
    cache_name = '_cache_' + fn.__name__

    @property
    def decorated(self):
        if not hasattr(self, cache_name):
            setattr(self, cache_name, fn(self))
        return getattr(self, cache_name)

    return decorated

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Check if weak reference to `self` exists
    if hasattr(self, '_weakref'):
        # Get strong reference from weak reference
        period = self._weakref()
        if period is not None:
            return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return None
```

The modification allows us to handle the case when the weak reference becomes `None`. If the weak reference is not `None`, we retrieve the strong reference and pass it to `_engine_type`. Otherwise, we return `None`.

With this change, the bug should be fixed and the test should pass without causing any issues in other parts of the code.
