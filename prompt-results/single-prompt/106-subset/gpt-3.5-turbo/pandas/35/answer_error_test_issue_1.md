To fix the bug in the code, we need to modify the `_engine` function to ensure that the weak reference is properly passed to `_engine_type`.

Here's the fixed code:

```python
class cache_readonly:
    def __init__(self, function):
        self.function = function
        self.name = function.__name__

    def __get__(self, instance, owner):
        if instance is None:
            return self
        value = self.function(instance)
        setattr(instance, self.name, value)  # Fixed line, update instance attribute
        return value

def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)  # Modified line, update weak reference
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))  # Modified line, retrieve weak reference
```

Explanation:
1. The `cache_readonly` is a descriptor that caches the value obtained from calling the decorated function.
2. In the `__get__` method of the descriptor, we first check if `instance` is `None` to handle access from the class itself.
3. If `instance` is not `None`, we call the original function and store the value in the instance attribute with the same name as the function.
4. In the `_engine` method, we modify the `weakref.ref()` call to create a weak reference to `self`.
5. When calling `_engine_type`, we use `period()` to retrieve the actual object from the weak reference.

By updating the weak reference and retrieving the object from the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the weak reference is properly handled and the bug is fixed.
