To fix the bug in the given code, we need to modify the `_engine` function to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is used correctly. We can do this by changing the `period` variable to a weak reference of `self` and then calling the `self._engine_type` function using the weak reference.

Here's the fixed code:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    cache_name = f'_{func.__name__}_cache'

    def wrapper(self):
        if not hasattr(self, cache_name):
            setattr(self, cache_name, func(self))
        return getattr(self, cache_name)

    return property(wrapper)

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This fix ensures that the weak reference to `self` is created and used correctly when calling the `_engine_type` function. This should resolve the bug and allow the program to pass the failed test without affecting other successful tests.
