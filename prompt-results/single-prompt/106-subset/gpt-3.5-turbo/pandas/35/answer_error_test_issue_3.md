The issue can be fixed by modifying the `_engine` function to check if `self` is still valid before creating the weak reference. If `self` is no longer valid, we can return `None` instead of creating the weak reference.

Here is the fixed code snippet:

```python
import weakref

def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    if self is not None:
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    else:
        return None
```

This fix ensures that if `self` is not valid (possibly due to being garbage collected), the function will return `None` instead of creating a weak reference and avoid the AttributeError.

Please note that for the fix to be applied correctly, the updated code snippet should replace the original `_engine` function in the source code.
