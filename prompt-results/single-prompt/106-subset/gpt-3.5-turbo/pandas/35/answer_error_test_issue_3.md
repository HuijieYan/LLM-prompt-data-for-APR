To fix the bug in the code snippet, we need to modify the `_engine` function to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly passed to `_engine_type`. Additionally, we need to handle the case where `_engine_type` returns `None` and return an empty engine object instead. Here's the modified code:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    engine_cache = {}

    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        if func not in engine_cache:
            engine_cache[func] = func(*args, **kwargs)
        return engine_cache[func]

    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        engine = self._engine_type()
    return engine
```

With this fix, the `_engine` function will first try to create the engine object with the weak reference of `self` as intended. If the engine object is `None`, it will then create an empty engine object using the default constructor of `_engine_type`.

The modified code should pass the test without raising the `AttributeError` exception.
