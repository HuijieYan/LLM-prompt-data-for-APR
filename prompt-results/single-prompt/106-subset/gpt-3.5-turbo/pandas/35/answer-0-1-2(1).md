To fix the bug in the code, we need to modify the `_engine` method to properly pass the weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type` function. Here's the fixed code:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    cache_name = "_" + func.__name__

    @property
    def wrapper(self):
        if not hasattr(self, cache_name):
            setattr(self, cache_name, func(self))
        return getattr(self, cache_name)

    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

The fix involves adding `()` after `weakref.ref(self)` to call the weak reference and get the actual object to pass it to `_engine_type` function.

After applying the fix, the test should pass and return `True`.
