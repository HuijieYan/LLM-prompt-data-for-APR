The issue in the code is that bullet points are not being displayed correctly under the "Arguments" section of the documentation. To fix this issue, we need to modify the `process_list_block` function to properly handle the bullet points.

Here's the fixed code:

```python
import re
import pytest
from markdown import markdown

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else
                                      ending_point - 1)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    # Usually lines have at least 4 additional leading spaces.
    # These have to be removed, but first the list roots have to be detected.
    top_level_regex = r'^    ([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)'
    top_level_replacement = r'- __\1__:\2'
    lines = [re.sub(top_level_regex, top_level_replacement, line) for line in lines]
    # All the other lines get simply the leading space (if present) removed
    lines = [re.sub(r'^([ ]*)', lambda m: '-' * len(m.group(1)), line) for line in lines]
    # Join the lines to form the block again
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block

test_doc1 = {
    'doc': """Base class for recurrent layers.
    # Arguments
        return_sequences: Boolean. Whether to return the last output
            in the output sequence, or the full sequence.
        return_state: Boolean. Whether to return the last state
            in addition to the output.
    """,
    'result': '''Base class for recurrent layers.

- __return_sequences__: Boolean. Whether to return the last output

'''}

test_doc_with_arguments_as_last_block = {
    'doc': """Base class for recurrent layers.
    # Arguments
        return_sequences: Boolean. Whether to return the last output
            in the output sequence, or the full sequence.

            in addition to the output.
    """,
    'result': '''Base class for recurrent layers.
__Arguments__
- __return_sequences__: Boolean. Whether to return the last output
    in the output sequence, or the full sequence.
- __return_state__: Boolean. Whether to return the last state
    in addition to the output.
'''}

@pytest.mark.parametrize('docs_descriptor', [
    test_doc1,
    test_doc_with_arguments_as_last_block,
])
def test_doc_lists(docs_descriptor):
    docstring = process_list_block(docs_descriptor['doc'])[0]
    assert markdown(docstring) == markdown(docs_descriptor['result'])
```

I have added a new regex pattern to replace the leading spaces with the bullets. After rejoining the lines, the modified `docstring` is returned and tested against the expected result using the `test_doc_lists` function.

Please let me know if I can help you with anything else.
