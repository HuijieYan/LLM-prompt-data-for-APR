To fix the bug in the `process_list_block` function, we need to modify the regular expression used to detect list elements. In the current code, the regular expression `r'^    ([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)'` is used to detect top-level list elements. However, this regular expression is incorrect and fails to match the elements properly.

To fix this, we can modify the regular expression to `r'^(-[^\s\\\(]+):(.*)'`. This regex will correctly match list elements starting with a hyphen and followed by any non-whitespace characters. We can also update the replacement pattern to `- __\1__:\2` to preserve the bullet point format.

Here is the modified code:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else
                                      ending_point - 1)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    # Usually lines have at least 4 additional leading spaces.
    # These have to be removed, but first the list roots have to be detected.
    top_level_regex = r'^(-[^\s\\\(]+):(.*)'  # Updated regex
    top_level_replacement = r'- __\1__:\2'  # Updated replacement pattern
    lines = [re.sub(top_level_regex, top_level_replacement, line) for line in lines]
    # All the other lines get simply the 4 leading space (if present) removed
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ', '', line) for line in lines]
    # Fix text lines after lists
    indent = 0
    text_block = False
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        spaces = re.search(r'\S', line)
        if spaces:
            # If it is a list element
            if line[spaces.start()] == '-':
                indent = spaces.start() + 1
                if text_block:
                    text_block = False
                    lines[i] = '\n' + line
            elif spaces.start() < indent:
                text_block = True
                indent = spaces.start()
                lines[i] = '\n' + line
        else:
            text_block = False
            indent = 0
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
```

With this modification, the `process_list_block` function should fix the bug and pass the failed test without affecting other successful tests.
