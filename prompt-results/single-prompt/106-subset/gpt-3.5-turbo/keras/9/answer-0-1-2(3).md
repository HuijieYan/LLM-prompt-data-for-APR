To fix the bug, we need to modify the `process_list_block` function. The issue is that the function is using regex to replace strings that start with four spaces, which captures both list items and text lines after lists. To fix this, we can modify the regex pattern to only capture list items and then handle text lines separately.

Here's the modified code snippet:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else ending_point - 1)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point] + docstring_slice + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')

    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]

    # Usually lines have at least 4 additional leading spaces.
    # These have to be removed, but first the list roots have to be detected.
    top_level_regex = r'^    ([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)'
    top_level_replacement = r'- __\1__:\2'

    # Handle list items separately
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        match = re.match(top_level_regex, line)
        if match:
            list_root = match.group(1)
            lines[i] = '- __{}__:{}'.format(list_root, match.group(2))

    # Remove the 4 leading spaces (if present) from text lines
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ', '', line) for line in lines]

    # Fix text lines after lists
    indent = 0
    text_block = False
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        spaces = re.search(r'\S', line)
        if spaces:
            # If it is a list element
            if line[spaces.start()] == '-':
                indent = spaces.start() + 1
                if text_block:
                    text_block = False
                    lines[i] = '\n' + line
            elif spaces.start() < indent:
                text_block = True
                indent = spaces.start()
                lines[i] = '\n' + line
        else:
            text_block = False
            indent = 0

    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
```

With this fix, the `process_list_block` function should now correctly handle list items and text lines after lists. It only modifies the list items, replacing them with the desired format (`- __list_root__: line`) and removes the 4 leading spaces from text lines. This fix should allow the program to pass the failed test without affecting other successful tests.

Please note that the modified code relies on the `re` module, so make sure to include `import re` at the top of your code file or module.
