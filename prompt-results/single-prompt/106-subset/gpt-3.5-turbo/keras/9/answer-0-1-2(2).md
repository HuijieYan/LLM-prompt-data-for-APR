The issue in the code is that the regular expression used to detect list elements in the `process_list_block` function is incorrect. It fails to match the hyphen character ("-") at the beginning of list elements. This causes incorrect indentation and formatting of the list items in the processed docstring.

To fix this bug, you need to update the regular expression pattern used for matching list elements. The fixed code snippet is as follows:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else
                                      ending_point - 1)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    
    # Update the regular expression for matching list elements
    top_level_regex = r'^- ([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)'
    top_level_replacement = r'- __\1__:\2'
    lines = [re.sub(top_level_regex, top_level_replacement, line) for line in lines]
    
    # All the other lines get simply the 4 leading space (if present) removed
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ', '', line) for line in lines]
    # Fix text lines after lists
    indent = 0
    text_block = False
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        spaces = re.search(r'\S', line)
        if spaces:
            # If it is a list element
            if line[spaces.start()] == '-':
                indent = spaces.start() + 1
                if text_block:
                    text_block = False
                    lines[i] = '\n' + line
            elif spaces.start() < indent:
                text_block = True
                indent = spaces.start()
                lines[i] = '\n' + line
        else:
            text_block = False
            indent = 0
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
```

This fix updates the regular expression pattern from `^    ([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)` to `^- ([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)`. This change ensures that list elements starting with a hyphen are correctly identified and processed.

Please note that this fix only addresses the specific bug mentioned. It doesn't guarantee that all other parts of the code are bug-free.
