The issue in the code is that the regex pattern that is used to detect top-level list elements is not working correctly. The pattern `r'^    ([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)'` is incorrect because it expects the list elements to start with 4 spaces followed by a non-whitespace character. However, in the test case, the list elements start with a tab character.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the regex pattern to include both space and tab characters. Here's the modified code:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else
                                      ending_point - 1)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    # Usually lines have at least 4 additional leading spaces.
    # These have to be removed, but first the list roots have to be detected.
    top_level_regex = r'^\s*([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)'
    top_level_replacement = r'- __\1__:\2'
    lines = [re.sub(top_level_regex, top_level_replacement, line) for line in lines]

    # Rest of the code
    # ...
    
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
```

With this change, the pattern `r'^\s*([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)'` will match list elements that start with any number of spaces or tabs.

This fix should allow the program to pass the failed test without affecting other successful tests.
