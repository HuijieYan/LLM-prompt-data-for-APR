One possible fix for the bug in the `process_list_block` function is to replace the regular expressions used to remove leading white spaces and detect list roots with string manipulation operations. Here's the fixed code:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else
                                      ending_point - 1)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [line[leading_spaces:] for line in lines]
    # Usually lines have at least 4 additional leading spaces.
    # These have to be removed, but first the list roots have to be detected.
    lines = ['- __' + line[4:] if line.startswith('    ') else line for line in lines]
    # All the other lines get simply the 4 leading space (if present) removed
    lines = [line[4:] if line.startswith('    ') else line for line in lines]
    # Fix text lines after lists
    indent = 0
    text_block = False
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        spaces = re.search(r'\S', line)
        if spaces:
            # If it is a list element
            if line[spaces.start()] == '-':
                indent = spaces.start() + 1
                if text_block:
                    text_block = False
                    lines[i] = '\n' + line
            elif spaces.start() < indent:
                text_block = True
                indent = spaces.start()
                lines[i] = '\n' + line
        else:
            text_block = False
            indent = 0
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
```

This fix modifies the lines of code that remove leading white spaces and detect list roots. It replaces the regular expression-based approach with simple string manipulations.

The fixed method can be easily applied to the original project by updating the corresponding function with the provided code snippet.
