To fix the bug in the `process_list_block` function, we need to modify the regular expression pattern used in the `re.sub` function. The existing pattern matches the start of a line with 4 spaces, followed by a group of characters that are not whitespace, backslash, or open parenthesis, followed by a colon. However, the pattern does not correctly handle cases where there are additional leading spaces before the list element. 

To fix this, we can update the regular expression pattern to match any number of leading spaces before the list element. 

Here is the fixed code snippet for the `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else
                                      ending_point - 1)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    # Usually lines have at least 4 additional leading spaces.
    # These have to be removed, but first the list roots have to be detected.
    top_level_regex = r'^(\s*)\S+(.*)'
    top_level_replacement = r'- __\\2__:\\3'
    lines = [re.sub(top_level_regex, top_level_replacement, line) for line in lines]
    # All the other lines get simply the 4 leading space (if present) removed
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ', '', line) for line in lines]
    # Fix text lines after lists
    indent = 0
    text_block = False
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        spaces = re.search(r'\S', line)
        if spaces:
            # If it is a list element
            if line[spaces.start()] == '-':
                indent = spaces.start() + 1
                if text_block:
                    text_block = False
                    lines[i] = '\n' + line
            elif spaces.start() < indent:
                text_block = True
                indent = spaces.start()
                lines[i] = '\n' + line
        else:
            text_block = False
            indent = 0
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
```

This fixed code snippet updates the regular expression pattern to match any number of leading spaces before the list element. Additionally, it ensures that the replacement pattern correctly captures the parts of the line that need to be replaced while preserving the rest of the line.
