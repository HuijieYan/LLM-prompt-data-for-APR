To fix the bug in the `process_list_block` function, we need to address the issue with how bullet points are being generated for the `top_level_replacement`. Currently, the code uses a regular expression to match a pattern, capture the matched groups, and then replace the line with a modified version that includes the captured groups.

However, in this scenario, we want to add a bullet point (`- `) before each line that matches the pattern. To achieve this, we can modify the regular expression to include the entire line in the first captured group and then replace the line with the captured group preceded by a bullet point.

Here's the fixed code for the `process_list_block` function:

```python
def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else
                                      ending_point - 1)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    # Usually lines have at least 4 additional leading spaces.
    # These have to be removed, but first the list roots have to be detected.
    top_level_regex = r'^(.*)$'
    top_level_replacement = r'- \1'
    lines = [re.sub(top_level_regex, top_level_replacement, line) for line in lines]
    # All the other lines get simply the 4 leading space (if present) removed
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ', '', line) for line in lines]
    # Fix text lines after lists
    indent = 0
    text_block = False
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        spaces = re.search(r'\S', line)
        if spaces:
            # If it is a list element
            if line[spaces.start()] == '-':
                indent = spaces.start() + 1
                if text_block:
                    text_block = False
                    lines[i] = '\n' + line
            elif spaces.start() < indent:
                text_block = True
                indent = spaces.start()
                lines[i] = '\n' + line
        else:
            text_block = False
            indent = 0
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
```

This fix modifies the regular expression used in `top_level_regex` to capture the entire line and replaces it with `- \1`, which adds a bullet point before each line that matches the pattern.
