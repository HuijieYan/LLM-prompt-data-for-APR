To fix this bug, we need to modify the line that calls the `in_top_k` function. The issue is that the `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` expression returns a rank-0 tensor, but the `in_top_k` function expects a rank-1 tensor for the `targets` parameter.

To fix this, we can modify the code to use `K.argmax` instead of `K.max` to get the indices of the maximum values along the last axis of `y_true`. This will give us a rank-1 tensor as required by `in_top_k`.

The fixed code snippet is as follows:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```

This fix ensures that the program passes the failed
