The issue in the code is with the line `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)`. It is returning a tensor with shape (2,) instead of (2, 1) which is expected by the `in_top_k` method.

To fix this, we can add an additional dimension to `y_true` to make its shape (2, 1). This can be done using the `tf.expand_dims` function.

Here's the fixed code:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true = tf.expand_dims(y_true, axis=-1)  # Add an additional dimension
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(K.max(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```

This fix ensures that the shape of `y_true` is (2, 1) which is expected by
