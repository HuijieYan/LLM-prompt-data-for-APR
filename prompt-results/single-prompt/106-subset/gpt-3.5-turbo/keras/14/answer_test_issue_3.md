The bug in the code is in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function. The function currently assumes that the shape of `y_true` is `(num_samples, 1)`, but it can also have the shape `(num_samples,)`. As a result, the function is not producing correct output when the shape of `y_true` is `(num_samples,)`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the code to handle both cases of `y_true` correctly. We can check the dimensionality of `y_true` using the `K.ndim()` function, and then squeeze the dimensions if necessary.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    # Squeeze dimensions if necessary
    if K.ndim(y_true) > 1:
        y_true = K.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k),
                  axis=-1)
```

This fixed code checks the dimensionality of `y_true` using `K.ndim()`. If it is greater than 1, it means that `y_true` has the shape `(num_samples, 1)`, so we squeeze the dimensions using `K.squeeze()`. Otherwise, if the dimensionality is 1, it means that `y_true` has the shape `(num_samples,)`, so we don't need to squeeze the dimensions.

This fix allows the function to handle both cases correctly, ensuring that it produces the correct output for both `(num_samples, 1)` and `(num_samples,)` shapes of `y_true`.
