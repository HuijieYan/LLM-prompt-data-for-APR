The issue in the given code is that the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class is checking whether the length of the `input_shape` is equal to 2. However, in the failing test, the length of `input_shape` is 3 which causes the assertion error.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `build` method to check if the length of `input_shape` is greater than or equal to 2.

Here's the fixed code:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    assert len(input_shape) >= 2
