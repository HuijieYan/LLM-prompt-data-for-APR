The bug in the code is that the `build` function of the `Layer` class is not correctly handling RNN cells which have `state_size` as a tuple. The `state_size` attribute of the cell can either be an integer or a tuple of integers.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the code that sets the `output_dim` variable. We will use the `isinstance` function to check if the `state_size` attribute is a tuple. If it is a tuple, we will assign the first element of the tuple to `output_dim`, otherwise we will assign `state_size` directly.

Here's the fixed code:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

This fix ensures that the `build` function can handle both integer and tuple `state_size` attributes correctly.
