The bug in the code is that the `build` method in the original code snippet does not take into account the case when `cell.state_size` is a tuple. To fix this issue and ensure the replaced code requires minimal changes, we can modify the original code to handle tuples as well.

Here's the fixed code snippet:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

The fix checks if `cell.state_size` has a length, indicating it is a tuple. In that case, it assigns `output_dim` as the first element of the tuple. Otherwise, it assumes `cell.state_size` is an integer and assigns it directly to `output_dim`. The rest of the code remains the same.

This fix will ensure the `build` method can handle both integer and tuple values for `cell.state_size`, passing the failed test without affecting other successful tests.
