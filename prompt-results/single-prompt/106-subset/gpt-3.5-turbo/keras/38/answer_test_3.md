```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True

    # no time axis in the input shape passed to RNN cells
    assert len(input_shape) == 2

    self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                  initializer='uniform',
                                  name='kernel')
    self.recurrent_kernel = self.add_weight(
        shape=(self.units, self.units),
        initializer='uniform',
        name='recurrent_kernel')
    self.built = True
```
The bug in the original code is that the assertion `assert len(input_shape) == 2` in the test source code is not being executed. The correction is to move this assertion statement after the `self.built = True` statement, ensuring that it is executed after the loop in the `build` method. By doing this, we can guarantee that the test is executed without affecting the rest of the code.
