The issue in the given code is that it doesn't correctly handle the case when `cell.state_size` is a tuple. Currently, it assumes `cell.state_size` is an integer and assigns it directly to `output_dim`. 

To fix this issue, we can modify the code to check if `cell.state_size` is a tuple and assign the first element of the tuple to `output_dim`. This will ensure that `output_dim` is always correct, whether `cell.state_size` is an integer or a tuple.

Here's the fixed code snippet:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

By making this change, the code will correctly assign the correct value to `output_dim` and update `input_shape` accordingly. This change will fix the bug in the code and allow the program to pass the failing test without affecting other successful tests.
