The bug in the code is that the assertion `assert len(input_shape) == 2` is failing because the `input_shape` has a length of 3 instead of 2. To fix this bug, we need to modify the `input_shape` inside the loop so that its length is always 2. One way to do this is by directly indexing the first two dimensions of `input_shape` and ignoring the third dimension.

Here's the fixed code:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
