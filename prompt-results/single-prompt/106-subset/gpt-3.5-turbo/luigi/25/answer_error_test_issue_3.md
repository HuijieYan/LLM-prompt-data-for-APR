The issue is that the `s3_load_path` attribute is being called as a method instead of being accessed as a property. This is causing a `TypeError: 'str' object is not callable`.

To fix this issue, we can remove the parentheses `()` from the `self.s3_load_path()` call and access it as a property instead. This can be done by changing the line from:

```python
path = self.s3_load_path()
```

to:

```python
path = self.s3_load_path
```

Here is the updated code with the fix:
```python
def run(self):
    """
    If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
    will be called to attempt to create the table.
    """
    if not (self.table):
        raise Exception("table need to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```

With this fix, the program should now run without raising a `TypeError` when calling `self.s3_load_path()`.
