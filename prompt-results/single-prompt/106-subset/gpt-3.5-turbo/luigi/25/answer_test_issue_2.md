The bug in the code is that `self.s3_load_path` should be a property or a method, but it is mistakenly defined as a string parameter. To fix this bug, you can change the `s3_load_path` from a parameter to a property or a method.

Here's the fixed code:

```python
class MyRedshiftTask(S3CopyToTable):
    # ... other code ...

    @property
    def s3_load_path(self):
        return self.input().path

    # ... other code ...

if __name__ == '__main__':
    luigi.run()
```

By defining `s3_load_path` as a property, it can be accessed as if it were an attribute of `MyRedshiftTask`. The `input().path` will return the path of the S3Target defined in `requires()`, which is the `output()` of `MyS3Task`.
