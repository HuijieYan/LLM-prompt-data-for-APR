The issue is in the line `path = self.s3_load_path()`. The `s3_load_path` attribute is being treated as a method and being called with `()`. However, in the `MyRedshiftTask` class, `s3_load_path` is defined as a parameter, not a method.

To fix this issue, you can simply remove the parentheses when assigning the `path` variable. This will treat `s3_load_path` as an attribute and assign its value to `path`. Here's the fixed code:

```python
def run(self):
    """
    If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
    will be called to attempt to create the table.
    """
    if not self.table:
        raise Exception("table needs to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path  # Fixed line
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```

By making this change, the `run` method will no longer throw a `TypeError` and the code should execute without any errors.

Please let me know if you need any further assistance!
