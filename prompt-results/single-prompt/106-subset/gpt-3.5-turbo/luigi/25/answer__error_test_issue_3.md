Based on the error message and the suggested fix, the issue seems to be that `self.s3_load_path` is being called as a method instead of being treated as a string. The fix is to remove the parentheses when assigning `self.s3_load_path` to the `path` variable in the `run` method.

Here's the fixed code snippet:

```python
def run(self):
    """
    If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
    will be called to attempt to create the table.
    """
    if not (self.table):
        raise Exception("table need to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path  # Remove the parentheses here
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```

This change makes sure that `self.s3_load_path` is treated as a string, preventing the `TypeError` when it's called as a method.

Please let me know if you need any further assistance!
