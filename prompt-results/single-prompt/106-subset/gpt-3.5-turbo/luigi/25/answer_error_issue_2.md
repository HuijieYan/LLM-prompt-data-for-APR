The error `TypeError: 'str' object is not callable` is occurring because `s3_load_path` is being called as if it were a method, but it is a string property. To fix this issue, you need to remove the brackets `()` from the `self.s3_load_path()` line in the `run()` method.

Here's the fixed code snippet:

```python
def run(self):
    """
    If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
    will be called to attempt to create the table.
    """
    if not (self.table):
        raise Exception("table need to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path  # Fixed line of code
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```

By removing the `()` from `self.s3_load_path`, it will be treated as a property and not as a method. Therefore, this modification will fix the `TypeError` and allow the program to execute without any errors.
