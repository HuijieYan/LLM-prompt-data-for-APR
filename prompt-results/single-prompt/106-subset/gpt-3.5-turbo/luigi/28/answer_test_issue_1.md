Based on the issue description, the bug in the code is that the `table_exists` method is not case-insensitive. The `stdout` value returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function should be compared with the lowercased table name to avoid case issues.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By lowercasing both the `stdout` and `table` names in the comparison, we ensure that the check for table existence is case-insensitive. This fix allows the test case mentioned in the issue description to pass.
