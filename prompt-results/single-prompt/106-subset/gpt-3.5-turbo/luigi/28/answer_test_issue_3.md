The bug in the `table_exists` function can be fixed by converting both the `table` and `stdout` variables to lowercase before comparing them. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
```

With this fix, when checking for an existing table, the `table` variable is converted to lowercase using `table.lower()`, and both `table` and `stdout` are compared in lowercase using `table.lower() in stdout.lower()`. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive and resolves the issue of tables defined with different case styles.
