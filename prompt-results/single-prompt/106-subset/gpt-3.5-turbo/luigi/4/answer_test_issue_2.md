The issue in the code is that it is trying to get the length of the `self.columns` variable even when it is set to `None`. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of a `NoneType`.

To fix this issue, we can modify the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`. This will first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

Here is the fixed code snippet:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns`, we ensure that `len(self.columns)` is only executed when `self.columns` is not `None`. This fix will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when `self.columns` is `None`.
