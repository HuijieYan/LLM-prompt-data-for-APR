Explanation:
The issue is caused by checking the length of `None` in the `if` statement. To fix this, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length. By doing so, we can prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

I have made the suggested fix in the code snippet above by adding a condition `self.columns and` before checking the length. This fix ensures that the program will only proceed to check the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`.
