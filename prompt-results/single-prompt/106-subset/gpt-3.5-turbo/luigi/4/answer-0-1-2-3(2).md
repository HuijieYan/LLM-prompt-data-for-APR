To fix the bug, you can modify the `copy` method in the `S3CopyToTable` class by changing the condition for checking the length of `self.columns` to `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0`. This will handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.

Here's the modified code:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding `self.columns is not None` to the condition, it ensures that `self.columns` is checked for `None` before performing the length check. This modification will allow the code to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.

Please note that this fix assumes that `self.columns` can be `None`. If `self.columns` should always have a value (i.e., it should not be `None`), then you might need to investigate why `self.columns` is `None` in this case and ensure that it has a valid value.
