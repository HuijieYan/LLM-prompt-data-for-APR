To fix the bug, you need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. The code snippet should be modified as follows:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

Explanation:
The code change includes adding an additional check `self.columns is not None` before checking the length `len(self.columns)`. This ensures that if `self.columns` is `None`, the `if` condition will be False and the code inside the `if` block will not be executed. This handles the case where `self.columns` is `None` and avoids the `TypeError` that occurs when trying to call `len()` on `NoneType`.
