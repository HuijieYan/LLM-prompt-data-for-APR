To fix the bug, you can modify the `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class. Replace the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` with `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`. This change will ensure that the check for the length of `self.columns` is only performed if `self.columns` is not None.

Here's the modified code snippet:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
    COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
    CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
    {options}
    ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this modification, the program should pass the failed test without affecting other successful tests. The fixed patch can be easily applied to the original project by replacing the `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class with the updated code snippet.
