To fix the bug, you can modify the `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class. Here's the modified code:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before taking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This fix checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length, preventing the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. This approach requires minimal changes to the code and resolves the issue.

You can apply this fix by replacing the existing `copy` function in the code with the modified version provided above.
