```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
In the original code, the check `(len(self.columns) > 0)` raises a `TypeError` if `self.columns` is `None`. To fix the issue, we can change the condition to `(self.columns)` to account for both cases when `self.columns` is `None` or when it has elements to be processed. The replacement does not require significant changes to the source code and will allow the program to pass the failed test without affecting other successful tests.
