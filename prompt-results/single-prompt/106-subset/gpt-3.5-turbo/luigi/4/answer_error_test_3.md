The issue in the code is that it checks the length of `self.columns` without first checking if it is None. To fix this issue, we can replace `len(self.columns) > 0` with `self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0`. This change ensures that the code only attempts to calculate the length of `self.columns` if `self.columns` is not None.

Here's the fixed code:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

Now, the code checks if `self.columns` is not None before calculating its length, resolving the `TypeError` that was raised due to trying to calculate the length of `None`.
