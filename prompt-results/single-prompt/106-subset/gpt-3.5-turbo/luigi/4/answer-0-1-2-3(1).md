To fix the bug in the code, you can add a check for `self.columns` to ensure that it is not None before checking its length. This way, the code won't throw a TypeError when `self.columns` is None.

Here's the modified code:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns`, we ensure that the code only checks the length of `self.columns` when it is not None. This modification will prevent the code from throwing a TypeError when `self.columns` is None.
