The issue is occurring because the code is trying to check the length of a `None` value in the `self.columns` attribute. To fix this, we can modify the condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.

Here's the fixed code snippet:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This fix checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, the condition will evaluate to `False` and the `colnames` variable will remain an empty string.
