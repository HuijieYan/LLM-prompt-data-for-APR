To fix the bug, we need to update the `initialize` function in the `KQueueIOLoop` class from the `platform/kqueue.py` file. The current implementation throws a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` and there is already an existing current `IOLoop` instance. However, the check for an existing `IOLoop` instance is incorrect. 

Here is the updated `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is None and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        self.make_current()
```

Explanation:
- The condition `make_current is None` checks if `make_current` was not provided as an argument (it is `None`). If that is the case, we check if there is no existing current `IOLoop` instance using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. If there is no existing current `IOLoop`, we call `self.make_current()` to make the current instance.
- If `make_current` is `True`, we first check if there is an existing current `IOLoop` instance using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. If there is an existing current `IOLoop` instance, we raise a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists". Otherwise, we call `self.make_current()` to make the current instance.

With this fix, the program should pass the failed test without affecting other successful tests.
