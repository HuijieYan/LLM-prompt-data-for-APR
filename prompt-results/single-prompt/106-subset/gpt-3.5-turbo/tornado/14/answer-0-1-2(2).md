Here is the fixed code snippet that should pass the failed test:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

The issue in the original code was that it was incorrectly checking if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, and then raising a RuntimeError with the message "current IOLoop already exists". The fix is to change the condition in line 6 to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:`, so that it raises the RuntimeError when the current IOLoop already exists.

This fix ensures that the make_current check is done correctly and allows the test to pass without impacting other successfully passed tests.
