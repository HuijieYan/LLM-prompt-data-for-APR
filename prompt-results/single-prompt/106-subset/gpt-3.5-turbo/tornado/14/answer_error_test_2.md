Based on the error message and the description of the bug, the issue is that when `make_current` is set to `True`, the code should raise a `RuntimeError` if there is already an existing current `IOLoop`. However, in the current implementation, the code only checks if the current `IOLoop` is `None`, which means it will not raise the `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True`.

To fix this bug, we can modify the code to check if the current `IOLoop` is `None` only when `make_current` is `False`. If `make_current` is `True`, we will always raise the `RuntimeError` if there is already an existing current `IOLoop`.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current() is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this fix, the code will now properly raise the `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` and there is already an existing current `IOLoop`, as shown in the failing test case.
