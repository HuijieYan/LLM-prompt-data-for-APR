The issue in the code is that the `initialize` method raises a `RuntimeError` with the message `"current IOLoop already exists"` if an `IOLoop` instance already exists when `make_current` is `True`.

To fix the issue, we can modify the condition in the `initialize` method to check if `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None` before raising the exception. This way, the exception will only be raised if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

Here's the fixed code:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

With this fix, the program should pass the failed test without affecting other successful tests.
