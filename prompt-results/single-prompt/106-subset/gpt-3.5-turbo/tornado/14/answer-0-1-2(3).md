To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` method in the source code. The issue is that when `make_current` is True, it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, and if it is not None, it raises an error saying "current IOLoop already exists". However, the error should only be raised if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None.

Here's the fixed code snippet:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

The fix is to change the condition in the second if statement from `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None`.

By making this change, the bug should be fixed and the test case `test_force_current` should pass without affecting other test cases.
