To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file. The original code checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None and then raises a `RuntimeError`. However, it doesn't consider the case when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None.

Here is the modified code:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

The only change in the code is the conditional check in the `elif` block. Instead of checking if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, it now checks if it is not None. If it is not None, it raises a `RuntimeError` to indicate that the current IOLoop already exists.

By making this change, the `test_force_current` test case should now pass without affecting the other test cases.
