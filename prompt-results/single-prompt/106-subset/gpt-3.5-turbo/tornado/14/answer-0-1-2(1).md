The issue in the given code lies in the `initialize` method where it checks if the current IOLoop instance exists before making the current IOLoop. However, if `make_current` is True and there is already a current IOLoop instance, it raises a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists". But the actual issue is that if `make_current` is False, it does not check if there is already a current IOLoop instance before making it current.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `initialize` method to check if `make_current` is False and there is already a current IOLoop instance. If that's the case, then we can raise a `RuntimeError` with an appropriate message.

Here's the modified code snippet:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    else:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

By making this change, the code will now handle both scenarios correctly - whether `make_current` is True or False, and whether a current IOLoop instance already exists or not.
