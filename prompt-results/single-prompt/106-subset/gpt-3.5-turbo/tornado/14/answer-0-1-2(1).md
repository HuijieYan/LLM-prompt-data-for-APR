To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` method in the `KQueueIOLoop` class to check if the current IOLoop already exists before trying to make it current.

Here's the modified code:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        current = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if current is not None and current != self:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

The fix adds an additional check `current != self` to ensure that the current IOLoop is not already the same instance as `self`. If it is, then we assume that it is already the current IOLoop and raising an exception is not needed.

With this change, the test should pass without any errors.
