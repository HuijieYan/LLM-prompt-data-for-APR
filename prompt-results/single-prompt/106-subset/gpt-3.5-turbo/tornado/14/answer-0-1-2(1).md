To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to check if the current IOLoop exists before trying to make it current. If it already exists, we should skip making it current.

Here's the fixed code snippet:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            return  # Skip making it current if already exists
        self.make_current()
```

Explanation:
- In the `if make_current is None` block, we check if the current IOLoop doesn't exist before making it current.
- In the `elif make_current` block, we check if the current IOLoop already exists before making it current.
- If the current IOLoop exists in the `elif` block, we immediately return from the function without raising an error.
- This fix ensures that the program doesn't raise a `RuntimeError` when attempting to make an existing IOLoop current.

The fixed patch can be easily applied to the original project by replacing the existing `initialize` function in the code with the fixed code snippet provided above.
