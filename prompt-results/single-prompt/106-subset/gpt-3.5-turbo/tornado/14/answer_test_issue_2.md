The issue in the code is that the condition `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is checked twice, which doesn't make sense. The first check is unnecessary and causes the error message to be raised incorrectly.

To fix this issue, we can update the code as follows:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

Explanation: 
- We don't need to check `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` twice. 
- Instead, we can combine the first `if` condition with `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` in the same if statement. 
- In the `elif` condition, we need to check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None, so we can raise the error message correctly.
