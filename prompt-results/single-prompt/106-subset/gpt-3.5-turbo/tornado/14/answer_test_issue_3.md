To fix the bug, we need to replace the line `raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")` with `raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop does not exist")`. This change would ensure that the error message accurately reflects the condition in the code.

Here's the updated code:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop does not exist")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this minimal change, the program would pass the failed test without affecting the other successful tests.
