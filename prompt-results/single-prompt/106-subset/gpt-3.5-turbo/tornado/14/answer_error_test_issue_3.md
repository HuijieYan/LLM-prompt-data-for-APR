The problem in the code is that the `initialize` function is checking if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` before checking for `make_current` conditions. This causes the code to raise a `RuntimeError` even when `IOLoop.current()` is `None` and `make_current` is `True`. 

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `initialize` function to first check the `make_current` conditions before checking if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.

Here's the fixed code:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```
Now the `initialize` function will correctly handle the `make_current` conditions and raise the `RuntimeError` only when necessary.

This fix will resolve the test error and the code will pass the failed test without affecting other successful tests.
