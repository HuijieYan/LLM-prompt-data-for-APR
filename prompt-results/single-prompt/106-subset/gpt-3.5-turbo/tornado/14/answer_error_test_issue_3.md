To fix the bug, we can modify the `initialize` function to remove the unnecessary check for `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` and update the condition to `make_current` as follows:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is None and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        self.make_current()
```

Explanation:
- The original code has a redundant check where it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` before raising a `RuntimeError`. This check is not necessary as the `raise` statement will only execute if the condition is `True`.
- The condition `make_current is None and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is added at the end to handle the case where `make_current` is `None` and there is no current `IOLoop` instance. In this case, we want to make the loop current.

By making these changes, the modified code should pass the failed test without affecting other successful tests.
