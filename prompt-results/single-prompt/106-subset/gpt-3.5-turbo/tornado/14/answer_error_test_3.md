Since the purpose of the program is to check if there is a current IOLoop instance, we need to modify the `initialize` method to handle the case where the `make_current` parameter is `True` and there is already a current IOLoop instance. 

Here's the fixed code:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```


Explanation:
- The code first retrieves the current IOLoop instance using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`.
- If `make_current` is `None`, it checks if there is no current IOLoop instance and makes the current IOLoop.
- If `make_current` is `True`, it checks if there is already a current IOLoop instance and raises a `RuntimeError` if there is.
- Finally, if `make_current` is `True` and there is no current IOLoop instance, it makes the current IOLoop.
