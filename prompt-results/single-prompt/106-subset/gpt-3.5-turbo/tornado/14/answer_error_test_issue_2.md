To fix the bug in the code, we need to modify the `initialize` method to check if the current IOLoop exists before trying to create a new one.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the original code, the check is inverted, causing the `RuntimeError` to be raised when the current IOLoop exists. The fix simply checks if the current IOLoop exists before trying to create a new one.
