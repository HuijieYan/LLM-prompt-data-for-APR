A possible fix for this bug is to modify the `initialize` function in the following way:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

Explanation: The issue occurs when `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `not None`. In this case, the code is incorrectly raising a `RuntimeError` stating that the current IOLoop already exists. The fix checks if `current_ioloop` is `not None` and raises the `RuntimeError` if it is, ensuring that a new IOLoop is not created if one already exists.
