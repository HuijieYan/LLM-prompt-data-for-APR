The reason for the test failure is that the function is attempting to convert boolean values to date types, which is impossible. In the process of testing, a boolean Series is created and this series is sent to the '_try_convert_to_date' method. A solution to this would be to add a condition that checks if the series is a boolean type before attempting the conversion. This condition should return the data immediately if it is boolean, as boolean values are not convertible to DateTime. Below is the corrected code:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object" and new_data.dtype != "bool":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

This code adds an extra check in `if new_data.dtype == "object":` to become `if new_data.dtype == "object" and new_data.dtype != "bool":`, which prevents the date conversion from happening when the data type is boolean. This should make the test pass and it should not break any other tests as it is only adding another condition, not changing the existing conditions or the control flow of the code.
