The error message indicates that the `parsed.hostname` is `None` when a file URL or an FTP URL is passed to the `request_httprepr` function, making the `to_bytes` function fail. 

You can easily fix this issue by checking if parsed.hostname is None before trying to convert it to bytes. 

Here the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname is not None:   # Check for None before converting to bytes
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    if request.body:   # Check if request.body is not None to avoid TypeError
        s += request.body   
    return s
```
