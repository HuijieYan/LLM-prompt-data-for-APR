The error message indicates that the function `to_bytes` receives `None` from `parsed.hostname` which leads to a `TypeError`. The error is likely to occur for URL schemas like `file://` or `ftp://` that do not use the host field.

You can fix this error by adding a check before trying to encode `parsed.hostname`. If `parsed.hostname` is `None`, use an empty string instead. 

The modified source code should look like this:

```Python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    hostname = parsed.hostname or '' # Use an empty string if parsed.hostname is None
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

This patch will fix the bug without affecting other successful tests and can be easily applied to the original project.
