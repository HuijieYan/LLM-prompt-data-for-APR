This is a classic case of a NoneType error. The line `to_bytes(parsed.hostname)` is trying to convert `parsed.hostname` to bytes. However, in the case of non-http requests like the one in the test function, `parsed.hostname` would return `None` and cause an error. A `None` check may be added to avoid the error. 

A fixed version of `request_httprepr()` would look like this:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:  # Add None type check here
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In this patched version, the error-prone statement is only reached when `parsed.hostname` is not `None`. And this would not affect any other parts of the source code.
