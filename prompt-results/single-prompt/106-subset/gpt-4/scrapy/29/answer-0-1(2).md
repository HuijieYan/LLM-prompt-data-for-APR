The traceback shows that the error occurs on this line:

```python
s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
```

This means `parsed.hostname` is `None`, which is causing the `TypeError` when passed to the `to_bytes` function.

Since `parsed.hostname` can be `None` for non-http requests, we should add a check. If `parsed.hostname` is `None`, we can use a fallback value, like an empty string:

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    hostname = parsed.hostname or '' # add fallback for None hostname
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(hostname) + b"\r\n" # use the hostname variable here
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
Adding this check should resolve the error without impacting any other successful tests. This patch can be easily applied to the original project.
