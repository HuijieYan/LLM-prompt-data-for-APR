The error message says that to_bytes received NoneType. It seems that parsed.hostname was None. Let's add a condition to check if parsed.hostname is not None before trying to cast it to bytes. The bug should be fixed in the production code. 

Here is the fixed source code:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname is not None: # Add check here
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this fix, the request_httprepr function will not attempt to add a host field if parsed.hostname is None, preventing the TypeError from being raised when calling to_bytes with a None argument.
