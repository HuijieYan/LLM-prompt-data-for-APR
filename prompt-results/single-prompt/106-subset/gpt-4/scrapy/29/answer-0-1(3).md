I have fixed the bug in the given code snippet. Here's the updated `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    # Check if parsed.hostname is not None before converting to bytes
    if parsed.hostname is not None:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    else:
        s += b"Host: unknown\r\n"
        
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

This fix ensures that if `parsed.hostname` is `None`, the function won't raise a TypeError and instead adds a placeholder "unknown" hostname. The fixed code should now pass the failed test without affecting any other successful tests.
