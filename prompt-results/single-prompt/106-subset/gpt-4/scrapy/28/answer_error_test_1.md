It seems the issue is related to the file not being closed properly after the first `RFPDupeFilter` instance. I suggest using a `with` statement to ensure that the file is closed before the second `RFPDupeFilter` instance tries to access it. This will prevent the blocking of resources.

Here is the modified `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
    self.file = None
    self.fingerprints = set()
    self.logdupes = True
    self.debug = debug
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    if path:
        with open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+') as seen_file:
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in seen_file)
        self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
```

This change ensures that the file is opened, its contents read and processed, and immediately closed before being reopened for the object's `self.file` attribute. This should allow the test to pass without any issues.
