To fix the issue, we'll ensure that the file is correctly closed and safely read the data from it in the `__init__` method of the class. Here's the modified source code with a minimal change to fix the issue:

```python
def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
    self.file = None
    self.fingerprints = set()
    self.logdupes = True
    self.debug = debug
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    if path:
        file_path = os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen')
        with open(file_path, 'a+') as file:
            self.file = file
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
        self.file = open(file_path, 'a+')
```

The temporary file within the context of `with open(...) as file` is closed automatically upon exit and ensures safe reading. The opened file is stored in `self.file` again after reading, so the program's behavior remains unchanged, and the changes are minimal.
