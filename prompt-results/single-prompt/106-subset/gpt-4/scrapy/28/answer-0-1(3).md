The issue here seems to be that the "requests.seen" file is not properly getting saved and closed. This is causing the error since the next test cases are failing trying to access any updates made by the previous methods. 

Here's an updated `__init__` function which contains an additional line to save the contents of the file after updating it:

```python
def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
    self.file = None
    self.fingerprints = set()
    self.logdupes = True
    self.debug = debug
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    if path:
        self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
        self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
        self.file.close() # close the file after updating
```

This change ensures that any updates made to the "requests.seen" file are properly saved and the file is subsequently closed to prevent the `ResourceWarning: unclosed file` error from occurring. By ensuring the file is properly closed after the update, any subsequent tests which invoke `request_seen` should be able to accurately determine whether a request was seen previously.
