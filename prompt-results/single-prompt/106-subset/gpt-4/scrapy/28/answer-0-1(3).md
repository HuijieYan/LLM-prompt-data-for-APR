I found the issue in your source code. The problem is that the file "requests.seen" is opened in the 'a+' mode which means it opens the file for both reading and appending. However, the file position is at the end of the file after the file is opened. So, when you try to read it in the same line, it does not read anything as it has reached the end of the file.

To fix this issue, add `self.file.seek(0)` to move the file position to the beginning of the file after opening it. Here's the fixed source code:

```python
import os
import logging
import tempfile
import shutil
from scrapy.http import Request

class RFPDupeFilter:

    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
            self.file.seek(0)  # Add this line to fix the bug
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)

    def open(self):
        pass

    def request_seen(self, request):
        if request.url in self.fingerprints:
            return True
        self.fingerprints.add(request.url)
        return False

    def close(self, reason):
        if self.file:
            self.file.close()

def test_dupefilter_path():
    r1 = Request('http://scrapytest.org/1')
    r2 = Request('http://scrapytest.org/2')

    path = tempfile.mkdtemp()
    try:
        df = RFPDupeFilter(path)
        df.open()
        assert not df.request_seen(r1)
        assert df.request_seen(r1)
        df.close('finished')

        df2 = RFPDupeFilter(path)
        df2.open()
        assert df2.request_seen(r1)
        assert not df2.request_seen(r2)
        assert df2.request_seen(r2)
        df2.close('finished')
    finally:
        shutil.rmtree(path)


test_dupefilter_path()
```

Now, the test case should pass successfully.
