Based on the given error message and test case, it seems that the problem is related to the file not being closed properly. To fix this issue, you can use the `with` statement when opening the file. This ensures that the file is properly closed after it's used. Here is the fixed code for the `__init__` method:

```python
import os
import logging

class RFPDupeFilter:

    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            seen_file_path = os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen')
            with open(seen_file_path, 'a+') as file:
                self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in file)
            self.file = open(seen_file_path, 'a+')
```

This change ensures that the file is properly closed after reading its contents during the initialization, preventing the `ResourceWarning`.
