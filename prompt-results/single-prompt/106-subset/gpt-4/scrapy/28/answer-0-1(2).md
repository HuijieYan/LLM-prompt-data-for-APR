The error you're receiving is related to an unclosed file warning and the function `request_seen(r1)` returning `None` instead of `True`. 

To resolve the unclosed file warning, you can use the `with` statement in Python. The `with` statement in Python is used in exception handling to make the code cleaner and much more readable. It simplifies the management of common resources like file streams. To resolve the `AssertionError`, you have to implement the `request_seen()` method, which updates the `fingerprints` set and returns `True` if a request is seen and `False` if not.

Here's the repaired code:

```python
def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
    self.file = None
    self.fingerprints = set()
    self.logdupes = True
    self.debug = debug
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    if path:
        with open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+') as self.file:
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)

 # create request_seen method
def request_seen(self, request):
    fp = self.request_fingerprint(request)
    if fp in self.fingerprints:
        return True
    self.fingerprints.add(fp)
    return False
```

This code will now properly handle the file resource by ensuring that it gets closed when it's no longer needed, and it will correctly report whether a request has been seen or not.
