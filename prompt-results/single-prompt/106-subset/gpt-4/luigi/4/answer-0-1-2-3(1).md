Based on the issue description and test error, it looks like the problem is with the `copy()` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class specifically when checking `len(self.columns)` without first ensuring that `self.columns` is not `None`. To fix this issue, you can modify the condition in the `copy()` function as suggested in the issue description. Here's the modified `copy()` function with the suggested change:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Updated condition
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This change should fix the bug without affecting other parts of the code. It ensures that the condition checks for `self.columns` being non-empty and not `None` before proceeding to use it in the `COPY` command.
