Here's the complete fixed code. The only modification required is in the `copy` method, where we just need to change the condition to check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.

```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # ... (rest of the class definition)

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )

    # ... (rest of the class methods)
```

This fix should pass the failed test without impacting other successfully passed tests.
