You are correct that checking for 'self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0' would fix the issue. Here's the complete code with the fix applied in the 'copy' function of the S3CopyToTable class:

```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # ... rest of the class definition ...

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fix applied here
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )

    # ... rest of the class definition ...
```

Now the test should pass without any issues.
