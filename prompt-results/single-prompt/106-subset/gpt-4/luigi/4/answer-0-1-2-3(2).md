According to the issue description and the failed test, the bug occurs when the `columns` attribute is not provided, and it's causing the `TypeError` exception. To fix this bug, you can modify the conditional statement in the `copy` function to check if `self.columns` is not None before calling the `len()` function. Here's the modified `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the `self.columns and` condition before `len(self.columns) > 0`, it ensures that the program will not raise the `TypeError` exception when the `columns` attribute is not provided. This fix also preserves the original behavior for other cases and can be easily applied to the original project.
