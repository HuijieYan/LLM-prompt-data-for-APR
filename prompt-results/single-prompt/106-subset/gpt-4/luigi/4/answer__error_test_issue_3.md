The error message indicates that the `columns` attribute is set to `None` and hence the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` is trying to find the length of `None` which is not valid.

To fix this, I would add an additional check to see if `self.columns` is not None before trying to find its length.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

The key changes are the `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:` line. Before trying to find the length of `self.columns`, the code now checks to make sure that it is not None.

This solution ensures minimal changes to the source code, successfully lets the program pass the failed test, doesn't affect any other successful tests, and could easily be patched onto the original project.
