In the provided buggy source code, the error comes from the line:

```python
path = self.s3_load_path()
```

The `s3_load_path` is expected to be returned as a string, but it is being called as a function which raises the TypeError. To fix this bug, replace the line causing the error with the following:

```python
path = self.s3_load_path
```

Now, I will provide the complete and corrected `run` function below:

```python
def run(self):
    """
    If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
    will be called to attempt to create the table.
    """
    if not (self.table):
        raise Exception("table need to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path  # FIXED: TypeError: 'str' object is not callable
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```

By making this change to the source code, the `run` function should now pass the failed test without affecting other successful tests, and the fixed patch can be easily applied to the original project.
