As noted in the bug report, the problem is that the attribute `s3_load_path` is being treated as a method, which is why it raises a TypeError: 'str' object is not callable.

This issue can be fixed by replacing the line `path = self.s3_load_path()` with `path = self.s3_load_path`

Here is the fixed `run` method:

```python
def run(self):
    """
    If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
    will be called to attempt to create the table.
    """
    if not (self.table):
        raise Exception("table need to be specified")

    # Fix applied here. Removed function call for `s3_load_path`
    path = self.s3_load_path
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```

By replacing `path = self.s3_load_path()` with `path = self.s3_load_path`, we've ensured that when a string is being passed to `s3_load_path`, it will be properly handled and won't produce a TypeError.
