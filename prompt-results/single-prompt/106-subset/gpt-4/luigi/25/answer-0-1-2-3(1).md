The mentioned issue is due to calling `self.s3_load_path()` instead of referencing it as `self.s3_load_path`. `s3_load_path` is an abstract property and we are passing a string, not a callable object, which is causing the problem.

Given the constraints and the applied fix in the bug report, a possible solution would be to replace the line causing trouble with the correct one proposed in the bug report. 

This incorrect part of the `run()` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class:

```python
path = self.s3_load_path()
```

Should be replaced by:

```python
path = self.s3_load_path
```

So the corrected `run` function would be:

```python
def run(self):
    """
    If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
    will be called to attempt to create the table.
    """
    if not (self.table):
        raise Exception("table need to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```

This correction allows `self.s3_load_path` to be used as a string (as defined in the subclass) instead of being called like a function.

Remember to replace the code part of the `run` function in the whole class source code.
