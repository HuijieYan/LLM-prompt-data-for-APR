I have analyzed the issue and found the problem with the `table_exists` function. As mentioned in the issue description, the table name comparisons should be done case-insensitively to match the behavior of Hive tables. I have made the appropriate changes to the original code to fix this bug, here's the modified function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This replacement requires minimal changes to the source code and ensures that the program passes the failed test without affecting other successful tests. The fix can be easily applied to the original project.
