Since the issue raised suggests to make `table_exists` case-insensitive, you can change the line `return stdout and table in stdout` to `return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()`. This will ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive.

Here's the fixed source code:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This change will enable the program to pass the failed test without affecting other successful tests and can be easily applied to the original project.
