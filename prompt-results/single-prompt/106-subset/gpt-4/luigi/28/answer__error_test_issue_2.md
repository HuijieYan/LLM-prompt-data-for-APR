Based on the description of the issue and the Python source code examples given, it appears that the `table_exists` method is case sensitive when determining whether a table exists or not, due to using the `in` operator in its conditional statement. This could cause it to fail if a table name is capitalized in one place but not in another.

We can fix this by ensuring that both the table name from the input and the table name obtained from the standard output are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` Python function before comparing them.

Here's a fixed version of the `table_exists` method in the HiveCommandClient class:

```python
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table.lower()))
            
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table.lower(), self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```
In this revised version of `table_exists`, we use `table.lower()` instead of `table` when running the command and comparing the output. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, thereby fixing the described issue. If the table name is presented in a different case in the `stdout`, it should still be correctly recognized.
