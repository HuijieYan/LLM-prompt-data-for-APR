The buggy source code is not correctly handling the case where although the blocks are identical, their locations are different. Thus, it needs an additional check to ensure that blocks are in the same locations, otherwise dataframe is not equal. 

Here is the correct source code:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # checking that both blocks are in the same locations
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock) or not block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs):
            return False
    return True
```
In this new version of equals() method, there's an extra check if block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs) inside the for loop that iterates through the blocks. It checks whether the two blocks are at the same location, returning False as soon as it encounters a pair which is not at the same place.
