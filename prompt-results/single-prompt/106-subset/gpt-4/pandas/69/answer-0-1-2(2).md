The issue is in the "_convert_key()" function of "_AtIndexer" class. It improperly raises an error when an integer is used to index a non-integer index. However, pandas casts integers to floats when used in indexing. To fix this bug, we need to allow integer type keys to be used on non-integer indices, as pandas will handle the conversion.

Here's the fixed code:

```python
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):
    _takeable = False

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

With this patched code, pandas won't raise a ValueError when an integer is used to index a non-integer index, as pandas will automatically convert it to a float index value. The failing tests should now pass. 

This maintains the behavior that only integer type keys are allowed to be used on an integer index, keeping the original safeguards of the function intact, while allowing the flexibility of pandas indexing to be used.
