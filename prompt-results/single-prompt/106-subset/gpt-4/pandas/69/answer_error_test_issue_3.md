The problem here is the use of integer keys for an index that does not hold integers. In this case, `ser.at[4]` raises an error, because it is attempting to access a non-integer index with an integer indexer. The error was meant to be the case only when attempting to set an item, but it happens even while getting an item. This is due to a check in `_convert_key` method where the key is checked for type compatibility with the index.

Fixing the issue should involve updating the `_convert_key` method in such a way that keys get converted to the type of the index before they are used. The fix will still keep the `ValueError` for 'At based indexing on an non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers' with a conditional check for `is_setter`.

The corrected `_convert_key` method should look like following:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    
    # convert integer key to the type of index if the index is non-integer and key is integer
    if not is_setter and isinstance(key, int) and not self.obj.index.is_integer():
        key = float(key)

    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_setter and is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
This fix will avoid the `ValueError` during normal access, but it will still occur if you're trying to set a value with an incompatible key type. This makes sure the original behaviour of throwing `ValueError` for incompatible indexer while setting a value is preserved.
