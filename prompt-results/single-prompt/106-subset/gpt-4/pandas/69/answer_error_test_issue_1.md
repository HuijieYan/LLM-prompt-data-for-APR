Based on the failing test cases and the provided source code, there seems to be a problem when the code tries to enforce that the indexers must be the same type as the index. The current implementation raises a `ValueError` when encountering an integer key for a non-integer index. However, in the failing test cases, we expect that integer keys like `4` should be acceptable because they will be cast to float value `4.0` as mentioned in the test case comment "# GH#31329 .at[4] should cast to 4.0, matching .loc behavior".

To fix this issue, you can add a condition that checks if the value can be cast to a non-integer format before raising an error. Modify the `_convert_key` method in the `_AtIndexer` class as follows:

```python
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):
    _takeable = False

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if is_integer(i) and not (ax.holds_integer() or isinstance(i, float)):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers or integers that can be cast to float"
                    )
        return key
```

This modification allows integer keys that can be cast to floats without raising a `ValueError` for a non-integer index.
