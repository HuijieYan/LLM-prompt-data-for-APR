The issue raised suggests that the problem is related to the failure of index type conversion and strictness on the type checking inside the `_convert_key()` function.

When the tester defines the index as `series.index = series.index.astype("float64"))` and subsequently tries to access an element using `series.at[4]`, the `_convert_key()` doesn't respect float number to integer number conversion, causing the TypeError.

We can fix this bug by allowing a conversion from Integer to Float in `_convert_key()` function when the index type is not Integer. Here is the revised class `_AtIndexer`:

```python
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):
    _takeable = False

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                # Convert integer to float when the index type is not Integer
                if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                    key = (float(i),)
        return key
```

In this modification, when the index is not of integer type but receives an integer key, it converts the key to float to avoid the `ValueError`.
