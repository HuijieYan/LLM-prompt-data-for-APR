This bug happens because weak reference to the PeriodIndex is dropped. It looks like PeriodIndex's reference counter drops to zero prematurely, resulting in the deletion of the object.

The simple solution is to avoid using weak reference by directly assigning `self` to `period`.

Here's the fixed code:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # No need for weakref anymore, directly assign `self` to `period`.
    period = self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This will make sure that a proper reference to `self` is kept, preventing it from being garbage collected too early. The weak reference is not needed because there is no actual cyclical reference. If a cyclical reference were present, it would have caused a memory leak, but it's not the case here.
