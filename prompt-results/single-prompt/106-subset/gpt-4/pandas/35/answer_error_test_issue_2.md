The issue seems to be with the weakref implementation. Weak references to objects are issue prone in Python, as when no strong references to that object exist, it might get garbage collected, leading to None being returned instead of an instance when the weak reference is de-referenced.

The _engine() method being a property and not keeping a strong reference causes a problem; the returned engine is valid just until the end of the property function, because the weakref might become None at any time afterwards if no other strong references exist to the self object.

To solve the issue, we can instead use a strong reference to the object. The change focuses on removing the weakref dependency in the _engine function. The replacement will result in PeriodIndex to be garbage collected only when _engine is also garbage collected which is the expected behaviour. 

Here's the revised code:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

This alteration should resolve the test failure while keeping python garbage collection working as expected. The reason for the original use of weakref was to prevent a reference cycle, but we find in this case the reference cycle won't interfere with proper garbage collection since these objects are linked inside a cache where they will be removed concurrently. Thus, removing weakref won't introduce a new memory leak.
