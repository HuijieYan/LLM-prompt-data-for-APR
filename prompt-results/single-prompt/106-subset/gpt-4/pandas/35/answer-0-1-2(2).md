The test failed because the weak reference of self, i.e., PeriodIndex is dereferenced before it is used, which results in the attribute error. 

The root problem of this error is the usage of weakref.ref(self). A weak reference allows one to reference an object, but not keep it alive. If there is no strong reference to the object, it will be garbage collected. In this case, it is likely that the PeriodIndex object it is referencing has no other strong references and has been garbage collected, so weakref.ref(self) returns None.

Instead, self should be passed without being weakly referenced. The method should be changed to:

    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
        
This will keep a strong reference to the object, preventing it from being garbage collected before it's meant to be used.
