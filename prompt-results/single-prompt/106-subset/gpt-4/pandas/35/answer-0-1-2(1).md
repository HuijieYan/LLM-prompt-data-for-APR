The bug arises from incorrect usage of the `weakref.ref` function. Here, a `weakref.ref` object `period` is created that refers to `self`. But Python's garbage collector can immediately collect (delete) the object that a weak reference refers to if no strong references to that object exist. Hence, the error 'NoneType' happened when `_engine_type` is called using `period` as the `weakref.ref` object might have been garbage collected till that point.

To fix the issue, the `weakref.proxy` function can be used instead to pass a weak reference to `_engine_type`. A `weakref.proxy` returns a weakproxy-proxied version of the object instead of returning a reference object. A weak proxy works like a weak reference, but it can be used directly like a regular object without needing to be called.

This is the correct source code:

```python
import weakref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
This small change to the source code will keep the other/not-failed test pass, as this fix does not change the original logic of the source code. Also, this patch can be easily applied to the original project.
