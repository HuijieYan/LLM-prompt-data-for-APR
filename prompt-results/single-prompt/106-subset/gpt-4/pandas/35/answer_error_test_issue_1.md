To fix the bug, you can modify the `_engine` function by removing the need for a weak reference, which seems unnecessary in this case. Replace the `weakref.ref(self)` with `self`. Here's the modified code snippet:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # No need for weak reference, use self directly
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

Now the fixed code should not cause the test to fail:

```python
def test_get_level_values_when_periods():
    # GH33131. See also discussion in GH32669.
    # This test can probably be removed when PeriodIndex._engine is removed.
    from pandas import Period, PeriodIndex

    idx = MultiIndex.from_arrays(
        [PeriodIndex([Period("2019Q1"), Period("2019Q2")], name="b")]
    )
    idx2 = MultiIndex.from_arrays(
        [idx._get_level_values(level) for level in range(idx.nlevels)]
    )
    assert all(x.is_monotonic for x in idx2.levels)
```

By directly passing `self`, you won't encounter the issue of the weak reference being cleared before it's used, and the test should pass. The change is minimal and should not affect other tests or functionality.
