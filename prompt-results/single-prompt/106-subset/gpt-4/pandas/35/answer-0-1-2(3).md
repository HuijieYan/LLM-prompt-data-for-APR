The bug seems to be a result of Python garbage collecting (destroying) the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` prematurely because nothing else is holding a reference to it.

The `weakref.ref` function is used to create a weak reference to an object. Weak references allow the garbage collector to remove an object from memory while still allowing the object to be accessed until it is removed.

In your source code, the `period` object created by `weakref.ref(self)` is destroyed almost immediately because nothing else references it.

Here's a possible fix. The proposed fix keeps a strong reference to `self` in `_engine`. This way, Python's garbage collector won't destroy `PeriodIndex` since there's still a strong reference to it.

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, save a strong reference of self to _engine_type.
    period = self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This change should be enough to fix the bug and pass the test without affecting other successful tests as the only change made is within the `_engine` function and it doesn't affect its external behavior. It only changes how the reference to `self` is passed to `_engine_type` from weak to a regular reference. 

However, if other parts of codebase are relying on this function passing a weak reference, this may result in unintended side effects or memory leaks so be sure to thoroughly test your code after applying this change to make sure it doesn't negatively affect anything else.
