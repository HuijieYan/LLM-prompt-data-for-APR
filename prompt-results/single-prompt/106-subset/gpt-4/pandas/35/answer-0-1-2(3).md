The problem is that we're passing a weak reference of 'self' (which is `self.period`) to `_engine_type`, but that weak reference becomes dereferenced (i.e., 'None') by the time `_engine_type` is executed. So we need to store the weak reference to `self` in a variable that will live long enough.

To fix this bug, let's create a strong reference to 'self' by isolating the weak reference of `self` to its own variable `period_wr`:

Here's the fixed source code:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_wr = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_wr, len(self))
```

The code above creates a strong reference to `weakref.ref(self)`, increasing the lifespan of the reference and making it possible for _engine_type to use it.
