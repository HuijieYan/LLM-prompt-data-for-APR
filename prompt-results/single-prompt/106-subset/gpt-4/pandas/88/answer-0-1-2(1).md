The failure in this test case happened because the function `pivot_table` doesn't handle well when the table is reduced to a Series and there is a attempt to access the 'columns' property. The original code checks if 'table.columns.nlevels > 1', however 'table' can be a 'Series' and 'Series' objects don't have 'columns' attribute, raising an AttributeError.

The best way to avoid this error is check if the variable 'table' is a instance of a 'DataFrame' before checking if there is more than one level in the 'table.columns'. This guarantees that 'table' is a 'DataFrame', which has a 'columns' attribute.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot_table"], indents=1)
def pivot_table(
            data,
            values=None,
            index=None,
            columns=None,
            aggfunc="mean",
            fill_value=None,
            margins=False,
            dropna=True,
            margins_name="All",
            observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # ... same code

    # discard the top level
    if (
        values_passed
        and not values_multi
        and not table.empty
        and isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame)  # this line was included
        and (table.columns.nlevels > 1)
    ):
        table = table[values[0]]

    # ... same code

    return table
```

This modification ensures that the code access 'table.columns' only when 'table' is 'DataFrame'. This change should not affect any other tests and can be easily applied to the original project.
