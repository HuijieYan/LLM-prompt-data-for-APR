The issue here is happening when the `pivot_table` function is trying to access the `columns` attribute of a 'Series' object which does not have such an attribute. A solution could be to add an extra condition to check if the table is `instanceof` DataFrame before checking the number of levels of the columns.

Here is the corrected part of the code:

```python
    # discard the top level
    if (
        values_passed
        and not values_multi
        and not table.empty
        and isinstance(table, DataFrame)   # Added condition to check if the table is a DataFrame
        and (table.columns.nlevels > 1)
    ):
        table = table[values[0]]
```
So now, table's 'columns' attribute will only be accessed if it is a DataFrame. If it is a Series, it will not try to look for a 'columns' attribute. 

Note that the conditions above are contained in a single line 'if' statement and are separated by 'and'. Python checks these conditions from left to right and will short-circuit (not evaluate the rest) as soon as one condition is found to be False. This now protects the function from trying to access the 'columns' attribute of a Series object.
