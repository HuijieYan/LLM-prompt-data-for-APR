I have found a fix for the bug. The issue is caused by the type inconsistency in the table constructed in the pivot_table function. I have introduced a conditional statement to handle this case. Here is the fixed patch:

```python
def pivot_table(
    # ...
) -> "DataFrame":
    # ...

    # ...
    
    # discard the top level
    if (
        values_passed
        and not values_multi
        and not table.empty
    ):
        if isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame) and table.columns.nlevels > 1:
            table = table[values[0]]
        elif isinstance(table, ABCSeries) and table.name in values:
            table = table.to_frame()

    # ...    

    return table
```

This fix adds a check to ensure that if the `table` is a `Series` object, then we convert it to a DataFrame before proceeding with the rest of the function logic. This resolves the `AttributeError` that was causing the test failure.
