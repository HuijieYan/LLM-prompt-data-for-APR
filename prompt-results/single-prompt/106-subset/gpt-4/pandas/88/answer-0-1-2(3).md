Here's the fixed version of the `pivot_table` function. The issue was due to the provided `values` parameter ending up as Series instead of DataFrame when the input data only contain a single value column. The `items` variable caused the issue because it couldn't retrieve 'columns' from `Series`, so it raised an error. By converting the `Series` into `DataFrame` before accessing 'columns', we can avoid this issue. The modification is minimal and maintains the functionality for existing successful tests.

Check the modification in the condition that determines when 'values' should be discarded in the table. We must also verify if the 'table' is `DataFrame` (not a `Series`), which determines if the 'columns' attribute is available.

```python
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot_table"], indents=1)
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # ... code omitted for brevity...

    # discard the top level
    if (
        values_passed 
        and not values_multi 
        and not table.empty 
        and isinstance(table, pd.DataFrame)  # check if table is DataFrame
        and (table.columns.nlevels > 1)  
    ):
        table = table[values[0]]

    # ... code omitted for brevity...

    return table
```

This edited part allows the function to determine if "values" should be discarded based on the proper conditions. It won't attempt to access 'columns' from a `Series`, ensuring that the program doesn't throw an `AttributeError`. The modification also ensures that existing, successful tests remain unaffected as they won't violate the added condition.
