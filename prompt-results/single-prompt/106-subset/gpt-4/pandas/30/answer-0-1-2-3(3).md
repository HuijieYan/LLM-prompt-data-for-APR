The bug in the program arises from the fact that it's trying to convert a boolean value into a datetime. This happens when reading a JSON file with boolean values only.

Considering where the execution stop (at "def _try_convert_to_date"), the bug is most likely in this function.
We should try to parse the ndarray into a date column only if the data array dtype is int or float. Then it could be in epoch date format which requires conversion. Therefore, an additional condition has to be added for checking whether the data type is int64 or float64 / float32 before trying to convert it to date type.

The repaired program is therefore:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # attempt to convert to date only if dtype is int64 or float64 / float32
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number) and new_data.dtype.name in ["int64", "float64", "float32"]:
        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
    return data, False
```
This version of the function should resolve the bug and allow the test to pass. Note the added condition in the if clause that checks if the dtype of new_data is "int64" or "float64" or "float32". This ensures that the program only tries to convert numerical values into dates. By adding this condition in the original function, it mitigates the risk of trying to convert other types, which aren't convertible to date, into a date.
