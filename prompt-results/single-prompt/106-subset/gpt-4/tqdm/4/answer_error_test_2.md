I have identified the bug in the code and fixed it. The issue was that the variable `total` is not checked properly for being `None` before applying the custom scale. Here is the fixed code snippet for the `format_meter` function:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    # ... (rest of the code above remains unchanged)

    # apply custom scale if necessary
    if unit_scale and unit_scale not in (True, 1):
        if total is not None:  # Fix: Check if total is not None before applying custom scale
            total *= unit_scale
        n *= unit_scale
        if rate:
            rate *= unit_scale  # by default rate = 1 / self.avg_time
        unit_scale = False

    # ... (rest of the code below remains unchanged)
```

Now, the provided test case should pass without any issues.
