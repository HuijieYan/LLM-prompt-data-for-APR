To provide a fix to the issue, you need to ensure that your python function does not insert newlines between decorators. The part of the code adding potential empty lines is `newlines = 2`, it should be modified to handle decorator cases. Also, the section checking for `is_decorator` should be enhanced to handle different cases of decorators.

The updated code snippet would look like:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator and not self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line and (self.previous_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_decorator):
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 1 if current_line.is_decorator else 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0
```

The key changes are:

- Add a check for `not self.previous_line.is_decorator` when appending `depth` to `previous_defs`.
- Enhance check before inserting empty lines: empty lines shouldn't be inserted if the current line is a decorator or if the previous line is a decorator.
- Adjust the calculation for `newlines`. In case the current line is a decorator, `newlines` should be set to 1. So, it does not insert an additional new line between decorators.
