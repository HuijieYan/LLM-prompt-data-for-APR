The error message shows that unexpected newline characters are being added after decorators with comments.

The problem is in the condition where it checks if the previous line is a decorator. The code does not consider comments as part of the decorator thus the newline is added despite it being a decorator. We need to modify the code to recognize comments as part of a decorator.

The buggy line is `if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:`.

We should add a check to see if the current line is a comment, if so it should skip adding newlines. Let's do this by adding another condition to the if statement.

Here's the modified function with a faulty block:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line and (self.previous_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_comment):
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators or comments.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0
```

The updated code should now pass the test as expected. The failed test was because the program was wrongly adding newline characters despite the line being decorated. It failed to consider that comments can also be part of a decorator. The fix ensures that for interventions decorated with comments, newline characters are not added excessively.
