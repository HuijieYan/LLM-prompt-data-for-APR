Looks like the main issue is coming from the logic that handles insertion of new lines, particularly with decorators. The discrepancy here is that the expected result requires no extra lines between decorators, while the current implementation inserts extra lines causing the test to fail. 

By looking into the section of the code which handles decorators, we see that no extra lines should be inserted between decorators, controlled by the following block of code:

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
        # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
        return 0, 0

However, the implementation doesn't take into account the scenario where a decorator is immediately followed by another decorator with comments in between, hence it inserts additional lines. To fix this, we need to add a condition checking whether the current line is also a decorator. If it is, then do not insert extra lines. 

Using this analysed information, the corrected code should look like this:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator and not current_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0
```

By adding an "and not current_line.is_decorator" to the current decorator check, we can ensure that we do not add additional newlines between decorators, even when comments are present. The check now verifies that the previous line was a decorator and the current line is not a decorator, before deciding not to add any newlines. This should fix the bug and pass the existing test cases.
