It seems that the error is due to a misinterpretation of tabbed indents. The existing code does not correctly handle comments that are part of a dedent block. A simple yet effective fix would be to check if the character is a '#'. If this is the case, handle the line as if it was part of the current indentation block.

Here is the docstring for the method: 

```python
"""
This method advances and returns the first line up to column characters along
with the remaining lines.
Returns a tuple of str.
"""
```

Here is the replacement code snippet:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':
            # if this is a comment, handle it the same way as if it is part of the current indentation block
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This replacement snippet checks if the character is the start of a comment. If it is, then it handles it as if the indent has ended. This should allow it to handle comments nested inside indents correctly. The replacement is integrated in a way that inference with the rest of the successful tests is minimum if not at any inference at all.
