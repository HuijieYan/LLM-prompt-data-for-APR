It seems that the issue is with the handling of indent level for comments after a dedent. To fix the issue, we need to adjust the control logic of `_partially_consume_prefix` function. I updated the waiting for newline logic within the loop.

Here is the fixed version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                wait_for_nl = False
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

Please replace the original function with this updated version in your code. This should fix the indentation issue for tabulated comments after a dedent while still passing other tests.
