To fix the bug, you need to change the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. Specifically, you need to modify the condition in the `if wait_for_nl:` block to consider both spaces and tabs for indentation. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            if current_column < column:
                current_column += 1 if char == ' ' else 4
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this code, the `wait_for_nl` condition is changed by adding the following line at the end of the `else:` block:

```python
if current_column < column:
    current_column += 1 if char == ' ' else 4
```

This line updates the `current_column` variable correctly, ensuring that it considers both spaces and tabs for indentation when newline character is encountered.

You can test this change using the provided test case, and it should pass the failed test without impacting other tests.
