I have fixed the bug by updating the `_partially_consume_prefix()` function. The issue was caused by not properly handling the comment lines. When the function encountered a comment line, it did not properly update the indentation levels, resulting in incorrect indentation for the output. The following code snippet includes the updated function that correctly handles comment lines:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip().startswith('#'):  # Check for comment line and set proper indentation
                current_column = column
            else:
                current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This fixed function should resolve the test error and allow the program to pass the failed test without affecting other successful tests.
