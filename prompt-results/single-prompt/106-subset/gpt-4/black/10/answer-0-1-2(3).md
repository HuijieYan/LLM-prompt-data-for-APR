Here is the fixed `_partially_consume_prefix` function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True

    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
        lines.append(current_line)
        current_line = ""

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The problem with the original `_partially_consume_prefix` was that it only appended the current line if there was another newline after it. In the case of comments, there was no newline after the comment, so the line was not appended, causing the indentation to be off in the output. The fix is to explicitly handle this case by adding the conditional statement just after the for loop, ensuring that if the current line has useful content and the current column is less than the given column, the line is appended to the lines list.
