Here's a code snippet for the fixed `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True

    if current_line.strip().startswith("#"):
        while lines and not lines[-1].strip():
            lines.pop()

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This updated version should fix the indentation issue with tabulated comments after a dedent, only changing the comment indentation when the input file uses tabs. The fix should allow the program to pass the failed test without affecting other successful tests and can be easily applied to the original project by simply replacing the original `_partially_consume_prefix` function with this new version.
