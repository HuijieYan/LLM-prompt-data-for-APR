It appears that the error is due to the assertion `assert len(input_shape) == 2` within the `build` method implementation of the `MinimalRNNCell` class. The assertion expects the length of `input_shape` to be exactly 2, and fails when it isn't.

The input_shape being passed to the MinimalRNNCell's build method is coming from the outer build method, where the new input_shape is being formed as `(input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)`. This increases the length of input_shape to 3, causing the assertion to fail.

Once this assertion failure is encountered, the error cascades upwards to the test script.

Therefore, we can change the `input_shape` formation in the problematic `build` function and instead take the first two components for the new `input_shape`.

Here is the corrected python code:

```python
    def build(self, input_shape):
        for cell in self.cells:
            if isinstance(cell, Layer):
                cell.build(input_shape)
            if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
                output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
            else:
                output_dim = cell.state_size
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1])
        self.built = True
```

With this change, the `input_shape` passed onto the `MinimalRNNCell`'s `build` method will always have a length of 2, satisfying the assertion within and preventing the failure observed during execution.
