I see that the test is failing because the input_shape has a length of 3, but the build function in MinimalRNNCell expects a length of 2. To fix this issue, I will update the build function in the buggy source code to handle the case when the input_shape has a length of 3 by removing the last dimension.

Here is the fixed code:

    def build(self, input_shape):
        for cell in self.cells:
            if isinstance(cell, Layer):
                # Remove the last dimension from input_shape if it has the length of 3.
                if len(input_shape) == 3:
                    input_shape = input_shape[:-1]

                cell.build(input_shape)
            if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
                output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
            else:
                output_dim = cell.state_size
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
        self.built = True

This should resolve the test failure without impacting other successfully passed tests.
