The problem is that `MinimalRNNCell` in the test expects a 2D input_shape, but in the `build` function of the buggy source code the input_shape of the next cell is set as a 3D tuple.

To fix this issue, we can change the input_shape assignment in the `build` function of the buggy code snippet to set it as a 2D tuple. Here is the corrected implementation of the `build` function:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)  # Changed input_shape to be a 2D tuple
    self.built = True
```

This modification should pass the failed test without affecting other successful tests.
