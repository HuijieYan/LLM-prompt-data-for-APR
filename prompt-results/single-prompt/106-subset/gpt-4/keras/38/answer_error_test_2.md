The error is due to the `input_shape` being three dimensional and the code above is checking for it being two dimensional with `assert len(input_shape) == 2`.

We should remove the dimensionality constraint in the `build` function as we're dealing with a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) where inputs are often three-dimensional, including the time-step dimension.

Thus, the fixed source code is:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                  initializer='uniform',
                                  name='kernel')
    self.recurrent_kernel = self.add_weight(
        shape=(self.units, self.units),
        initializer='uniform',
        name='recurrent_kernel')
    self.built = True
```

By making these changes, we respect the layer's requirement for an input shape that includes the time-step dimension - typically `(batch_size, timesteps, input_dim)`. Furthermore, this doesn't affect other tests as we're removing an unnecessary restriction without changing the core functionality.
