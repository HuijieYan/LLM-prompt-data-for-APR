The issue is in how `input_shape` is being handled in the `build` function. It appears that the input assumed that there would be no time axis in the input shape passed to RNN cells causing an error in the assertion `assert len(input_shape) == 2` which expects `input_shape` to be of length 2. 

The error occurs during the test for stacking layers. In the stacking test cases, the input shape passed to the second and the subsequent layers should not be `(None, 5, 32)`, and instead it should be `(None, 32)`. One layer's output shape is the next layer's input shape, so we need to ensure the input shape to build function for every layer has length 2, which is not the case in the provided source code.

In the original code in function `build`, it updates `input_shape` based on `output_dim` every time in a loop as `input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)`. However, it should update `input_shape` to be `(input_shape[0], output_dim)`. 

Here is the corrected program:


```python
    def build(self, input_shape):
        for cell in self.cells:
            if isinstance(cell, Layer):
                cell.build(input_shape)
            if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
                output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
            else:
                output_dim = cell.state_size
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)
        self.built = True
```

Here, 
`input_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)` ensures that the input shape input to the cell.build() calls has length 2, resolving the AssertionError. This change should pass the failed test `test_minimal_rnn_cell_layer` without impacting other tests. This will result in a new input shape of the minimal length required for the build function in the test.
