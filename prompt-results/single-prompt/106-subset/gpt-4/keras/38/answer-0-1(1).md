The test has failed because the `assert len(input_shape) == 2` condition in the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class was not met. The `input_shape` that was passed in had length of 3 instead of 2, causing the assertion error.

The `input_shape` gets its value from the previous recurrent cell's `output_dim` in the `build` method of the original source code. When stacking cells, the output dimension of the previous cell is considered as the new input dimension (in this case, resulting in three dimensions).

In order to overcome this issue, the input_shape needs to be reduced to two dimensions before it is passed to the `build` method in `MinimalRNNCell`. Here is the fixed code snippet:


```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
