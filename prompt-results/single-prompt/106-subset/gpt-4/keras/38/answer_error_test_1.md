The assertion error indicates that there is an issue with how 'input_shape' is resolved in the function 'build' of the MinimalRNNCell. It asserts that the length of the 'input_shape' tuple should be 2, but the test is seeing a length of 3. 

It means that there is an extra dimension in the input shape where there shouldn't be. A reasonable guess would be the 'output_dim' being added to 'input_shape' in the 'build' method, which is a method of a parent or enclosing class, no doubt. 

The simplest fix would be to change 'input_shape' update line to:

`input_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)`

The revised code after adjustment:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
