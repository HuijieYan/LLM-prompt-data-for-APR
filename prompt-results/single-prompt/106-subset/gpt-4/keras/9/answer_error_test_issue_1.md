The issue here is in the regex operations, which affect the formatting of the list items in the docstring. In the source code, we want to replace any four leading spaces with the Markdown syntax for unordered lists. For this, a hyphen ("-") should be added to the beginning of the line.

In the original source code, there is also an operation that removes any space characters from the start of the line. This causes an issue when we try to mark these lines as list items by adding a hyphen character, as there are no spaces remaining for us to replace.

Here is the corrected source code:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else
                                      ending_point - 1)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    # Usually lines have at least 4 additional leading spaces.
    # These have to be removed, but first the list roots have to be detected.
    top_level_regex = r'^    ([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)'
    top_level_replacement = r'- __\1__:\2'
    lines = [re.sub(top_level_regex, top_level_replacement, line) for line in lines]
    # All the other lines get simply the 4 leading space (if present) removed
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ', '- ', line) for line in lines]  # change here
    # Fix text lines after lists
    indent = 0
    text_block = False
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        spaces = re.search(r'\S', line)
        if spaces:
            # If it is a list element
            if line[spaces.start()] == '-':
                indent = spaces.start() + 1
                if text_block:
                    text_block = False
                    lines[i] = '\n' + line
            elif spaces.start() < indent:
                text_block = True
                indent = spaces.start()
                lines[i] = '\n' + line
        else:
            text_block = False
            indent = 0
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
```
The correction is in the line where other line get simply the 4 leading space (if present) removed: instead of completely stripping whitelines at the line's start, we will look for those four spaces then replace it with `-`, as intended for list item in markdown format.
