The error arises from attempting to convert 0-rank tensor to 1-rank tensor, which is the expected input for tensorflow's in_top_k function. We need to reshape the tensor after casting it to 'int32' to ensure that it has the correct rank before it is passed into the in_top_k function.

Here is the fixed source code:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true = K.reshape(y_true, [-1])
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```

This fix transforms y_true into a 1-rank tensor before it's cast to 'int32', which should resolve the ValueError explained above while not affecting any other test cases.
