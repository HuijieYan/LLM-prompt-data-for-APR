The test error indicates that the dimensionalities of 'y_true' and 'y_pred' are not as expected. The 'sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy' function assumes that 'y_true' has a specific shape which may not always be the case. 

From the issue descriptions, we know that 'y_true' can take a shape of either (num_samples, 1) or (num_samples,), and the existing code assumes the shape to be (num_samples, 1). Therefore, when 'y_true' is shaped as (num_samples,), it would create a shape mismatch error.

We should adjust the 'sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy' function to handle different 'y_true' shapes. Additionally, note that 'K.max' is not the correct operation needed according to the problem description. Instead, we want to directly compare 'y_true' with 'y_pred' without taking the maximum along 'y_true'. Here is the correct version of 'sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy':

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    # New part: adjusting the shape of y_true to match y_pred
    if K.ndim(y_true) > K.ndim(y_pred):
        y_true = K.squeeze(y_true, -1)
    
    # Replaced K.max(y_true, axis=-1) with y_true
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```

This new code adds a check for the dimensionality of 'y_true' and squeezes it if necessary, and also replaces the erroneous K.max operation with direct usage of 'y_true'. The changes rectify the bug and should now pass the given test case and any other exposures of the same underlying bug.
