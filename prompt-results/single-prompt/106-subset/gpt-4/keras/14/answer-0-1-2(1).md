Considering the above details, the fix should directly compare with `y_true`. Bug states that, function `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` should correctly process the shape of `y_true` either as `(num_samples, 1)` or `(num_samples,)`. The issue occur when `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` returned a scalar value instead of a 1-D tensor which was required in `K.in_top_k`. Here, `y_true` should be of shape `(num_samples,)` instead of `(num_samples, 1)`. It can be achieved by applying `tf.squeeze` on `y_true` with `axis` parameter. 

Here is the corrected function `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy`:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true = tf.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```

This change ensures that the `y_true` tensor has the correct rank expected by the underlying `tf.nn.in_top_k` call, thereby avoiding the ValueError about tensor shapes. This fix involves minimal changes to both the original code and tests and retains compatibility with existing functionality.
