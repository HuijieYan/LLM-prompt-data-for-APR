The error occurs because the current implementation assumes that `y_true` always has shape `(num_samples, 1)`, while it can also be `(num_samples,)`. Since `K.max` on the last axis of an array with shape `(num_samples,)` would return a scalar instead of a vector of class labels, it would result in incorrect output. 

A way to fix this is by removing the last dimension from `y_true` if it equals 1 (with K.squeeze()) before taking the max. This ensures that we're always taking the max along the right dimension. Here's the fixed code:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true = K.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(K.max(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```

Now `y_true` will always be squeezed to a shape of `(num_samples,)` before taking the max, even if it were in shape `(num_samples, 1)` originally, solving the problem.
