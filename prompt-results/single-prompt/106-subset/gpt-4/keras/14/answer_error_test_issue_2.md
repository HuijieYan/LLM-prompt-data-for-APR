The error in the test results shows that the function K.in_top_k is expecting an input of rank 1, but is receiving an input of rank 0. This is due to the use of K.max function that returns a scalar (a rank 0 tensor), whereas K.in_top_k is expecting a tensor of rank 1. 

To fix this, we have to ensure the shape of 'y_true' is (num_samples,) by applying K.squeeze if necessary.

Here is the corrected version of the source code:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true = K.squeeze(y_true, -1)  # Ensuring y_true is of shape (num_samples,)
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```

Now, 'y_true' is squeezed to be of rank 1 and the bug with 'K.in_top_k' function should be resolved.
