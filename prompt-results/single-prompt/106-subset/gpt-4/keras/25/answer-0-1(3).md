I have reviewed the code and the error message. The problem seems to be related to the subtraction operation of the mean from the `x` array when the input array is of type int32. The subtraction results in a float64 output, which cannot be cast back to the int32 type. 

To fix this, we need to change the input array type to float64 before any operation, ensuring that the output type will be consistent and not generate an error. Here is the modified `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """
    The code and comments here are unchanged.
    """

    # Add this line to change the input to float64 type
    x = x.astype('float64')

    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x
    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        """
        The rest of the code here is unchanged.
        """
```

By adding `x = x.astype('float64')` before any operation, the input array is converted to a float64 type, and the operations will not result in an error when processing int32 input arrays. This change should allow the program to pass the failed test without affecting other successful tests.
