The error is caused by the code performing subtraction and division operations on an integer type input `x`. To fix this issue, we can convert the input `x` to a floating-point type at the beginning of the function. Here's the fixed code snippet:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.
    ...
    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """

    # Convert input 'x' to a floating point type
    x = x.astype(np.float64)

    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    ...
```

I added the new line at the beginning of the function to convert the input to a floating-point type. This change ensures that the program passes the failed test without affecting other successful tests and can be easily applied to the original project.
