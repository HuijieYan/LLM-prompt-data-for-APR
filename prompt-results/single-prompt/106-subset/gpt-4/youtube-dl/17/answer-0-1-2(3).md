It appears that the failing test case concerns a scenario where the parameter dictionary (params) does not contain the specified key (param). In such cases, the program returns an empty list without any assertion error. However, the current implementation attempts an assertion whether the retrieved value (params.get(param)) is a boolean. Since None is not a boolean, the program raises an AssertionError.

To fix this issue, you should place the assertion line under the condition checking line, that is, the parameter's existence must be verified before asserting its data type:

Here is the fixed source code:

```python
def cli_bool_option(params, command_option, param, true_value='true', false_value='false', separator=None):
    param = params.get(param)
    if param is None:
        return []
    assert isinstance(param, bool)
    if separator:
        return [command_option + separator + (true_value if param else false_value)]
    return [command_option, true_value if param else false_value]
```
 The problem is resolved by ensuring that the boolean type assertion is made only when the parameter's value exists. When the parameter is not found (None in Python), the function should immediately exit and return an empty list. This approach ensures that no AssertionError will be raised mistakenly. Moreover, this bugfix does not interfere with other test cases, thus making it a candidate solution.
