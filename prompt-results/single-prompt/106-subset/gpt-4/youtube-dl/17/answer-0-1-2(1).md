Observing the issue description and the associated test that failed, the issue arises when the parameter to check (param) is none. Although the current implementation correctly handles this case by returning an empty list, it asserts param to be a Boolean value after checking if it's None, which leads to an AssertionError if param is None.

To fix the issue, the assert statement ensuring the param is of the Boolean type should only be checked if the param is not None. This will allow handling both the situations where the param is None and where it's a Boolean type, ensuring the function doesn't break when the param is None.

Here is the code after fixing:

```python
def cli_bool_option(params, command_option, param, true_value='true', false_value='false', separator=None):
    param = params.get(param)
    if param is None:
        return []
    if isinstance(param, bool):     # check if param is a boolean only if it is not None.
        if separator:
            return [command_option + separator + (true_value if param else false_value)]
        return [command_option, true_value if param else false_value]

    # raise error if param is not None or a Boolean (to keep the current behavior)
    raise ValueError('param must be a boolean type.')
```
This solution fixes the failure raised in the tests by handling the condition when param(None in this case) is not a Boolean. An error is raised when the param is neither None nor a Boolean, analogous to how the original code intended toassure that the param must be a Boolean. Remaining functional elements are kept unchanged to ensure that the fix doesn't affect any other tests that were passing originally.
