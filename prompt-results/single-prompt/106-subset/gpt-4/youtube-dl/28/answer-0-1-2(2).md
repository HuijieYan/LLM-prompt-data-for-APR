The error arises because the program is attempting to convert a number that is out of the accepted range for unicode characters into a character. To fix this error, you can add a condition to check if the number falls within the accepted range.

The source code with the bug fix would look like this:

```python
def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])
    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        num = int(numstr, base)
        if num < 0x110000:  # added condition to check if num is within unicode range
            return compat_chr(num)
        else:
            return entity  # return original entity if num is out of range
```

This fix simply treats entities that correspond to numbers out of the unicode range as normal text, allowing it to be processed without error. This solution should not affect any previously passed test cases because it only adds additional functionality rather than changing existing functionality. It also fits in well with the existing code - no large changes were necessary.
