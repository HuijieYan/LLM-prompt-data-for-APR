The issue lies in the `elif make_current:` part of the `initialize` function, where a `RuntimeError` is raised when there isn't an instance and make_current is set as `True`.

The corrected version of the code is the following:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # code fixed on this line
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the fixed patch, `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:` is used to check if there is an existing instance when `make_current` is `True`. If an instance already exists, it raises a `RuntimeError` because another instance is trying to be made as current which conflicts with the existing instance. By this code fix, the test error "RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists" wouldn't be triggered improperly as before.
