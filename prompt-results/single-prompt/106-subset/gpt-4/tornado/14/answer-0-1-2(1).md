To minimally alter the source code and fix the bug, it seems there's a mismatch between the comment and the condition mentioned in the original code. The condition should actually check if the current IOLoop already exists (i.e., is not None), but the code is incorrectly checking if it's None. 

Here's the corrected source code:

```
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Change this line
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this change, the "test_force_current" test case should pass now, since it checks for a non-existent IOLoop before raising a RuntimeError.
