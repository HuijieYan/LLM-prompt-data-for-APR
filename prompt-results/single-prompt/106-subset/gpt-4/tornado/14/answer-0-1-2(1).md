Based on the error description and test scenarios, it seems like there is an issue with the logic in the `initialize` method. Here's the fixed version of the method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None: # Change this line
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This fix reverses the conditions for raising the runtime error. Now, when `make_current` is `True`, the method will raise a runtime error if there is already an existing current IOLoop. This should resolve the test error, as it now allows multiple IOLoop instances with `make_current=True` to coexist without conflicting each other.
