By reading the source code and the test cases, I found that the issue may be caused by the incorrect condition check in the `initialize` function. The `elif` condition should check if `make_current` is True and `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None`, instead of checking if `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`. This should fix the RuntimeError in the test `test_force_current` without affecting other successful tests.

Here's the corrected source code snippet:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

Now, this should allow the program to pass the failed test `test_force_current` and not affect other successful tests. The fixed patch can be easily applied to the original project by replacing the `initialize` function with the above code.
