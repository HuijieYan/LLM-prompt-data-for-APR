Here is the fixed code snippet:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

I have changed the condition in the second `if` block:

`if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` to
`if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:`.

With this minimal change, it should fix the bug and pass the failed test without affecting other successful tests.
