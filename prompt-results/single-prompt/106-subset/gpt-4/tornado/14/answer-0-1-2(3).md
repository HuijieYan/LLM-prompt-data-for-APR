The bug resides in the `initialize` function's condition, which should raise a RuntimeError when the current IOLoop exists and make_current is True, but the condition in the code is reversed. The correct implementation of the `initialize` function is as follows:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this change, the function checks for the existence of the current IOLoop correctly and raises an error only when there is an existing IOLoop with make_current set to True.
