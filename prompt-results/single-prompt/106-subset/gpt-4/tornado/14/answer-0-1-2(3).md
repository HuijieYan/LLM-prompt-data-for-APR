It appears that the bug was caused by an inappropriate condition check in the `initialize` method. I suggest fixing the initialization method with the correct condition check as follows:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

The change in the condition check is on the line with `elif make_current:`. The previous condition was checking if `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`, which raised the RuntimeError even when the current IOLoop did not exist. However, according to the test case, it should raise the RuntimeError only when the current IOLoop already exists. So, I changed the condition to `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None`.

This minimal change should fix the failing test case without affecting the other successful tests.
