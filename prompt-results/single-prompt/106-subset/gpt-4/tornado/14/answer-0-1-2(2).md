After examining the error and source code provided, I suggest the following patch to fix the bug in the initialize function. The problem is that the condition in the 'elif' block is incorrectly raising a RuntimeError when the current IOLoop does not exist (when IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None). This is contrary to the expected behaviour which is to raise an error if there already exists a current IOLoop. Thus, the condition should be reversed.

We need to replace:

    if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:

with:

    if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:

The bug-fixed python function now looks like:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # corrected condition
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
This alteration should fix the bug, allowing the failed test to pass without affecting other successful tests. Changes are minimal and should be easily applied to the original project.
