It seems like the condition check on line 252 is incorrect. Based on your description, the error should be raised when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None` instead of when it's `None`. The source code should be modified as the following:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

The adjustment has been made on line 8, changing the condition check from `is None` to `is not None`. This will fix the bug without affecting other successful tests.
