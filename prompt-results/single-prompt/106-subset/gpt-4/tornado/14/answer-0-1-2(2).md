I have found the issue in the code and prepared a fixed version of the function with minimal changes to the source code. Here's the fixed function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this fixed version, I have corrected the conditional statement on line 6. The original condition checked if `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`, which caused the `RuntimeError` to be raised when the current IOLoop didn't exist. The fixed version checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None`, which should correctly raise the error when a current IOLoop already exists.
