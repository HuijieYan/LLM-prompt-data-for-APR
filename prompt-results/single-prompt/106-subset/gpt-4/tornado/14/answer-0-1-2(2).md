The issue seems to be in the condition for raising the RuntimeError. The code should check for the existence of a current IOLoop when the make_current argument is True, but the current condition is checking when it's None. We need to swap the conditions for make_current being True and None.

Here's the complete fixed source code:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

This will ensure that the RuntimeError is raised when there's an existing IOLoop and the make_current argument is True, which should fix the failed test without impacting other tests.
