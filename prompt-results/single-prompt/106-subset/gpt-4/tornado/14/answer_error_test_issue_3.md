To fix the bug, we need to change the conditions in the `initialize` function. The problem is with the `elif` condition, where it raises an exception even when the current IOLoop instance does not exist. The correct approach would be to throw the exception when the current IOLoop instance already exists and the `make_current` flag is set to True.

Here's the fixed code snippet:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

With this fix, the program should not throw a RuntimeError when there is no existing IOLoop, and the test `test_force_current` should pass.
