The error arises from the check that raises the "RuntimeError" exception if an IOLoop instance already exists when the `make_current` parameter is True. Checking for the non-existence of the current instance doesn't make sense in this case, as we want to enforce that there is already an instance before switching to a new one.

Here is your corrected code snippet:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # change 'is None' to 'is not None'
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, a RuntimeError is raised when `make_current` is True, and the current IOLoop instance already exists, which is the correct logic.
