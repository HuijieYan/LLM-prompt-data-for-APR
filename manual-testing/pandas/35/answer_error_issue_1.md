The bug in the code is related to weak referencing of the `self` object. To fix the bug, we can replace `weakref.ref(self)` with `weakref.proxy(self)`.

Here's the fixed code snippet:

```python
import weakref

def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref.proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we ensure that the `self` object is still accessible within `_engine_type` without being garbage-collected.

This fix should resolve the AttributeError issue and allow the program to pass the failed test.
