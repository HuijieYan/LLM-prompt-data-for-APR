The bug in the code is located in the `_convert_key` method. The bug is that `is_integer` is not defined and should instead be `isinstance`.

To fix the bug, you can modify the code snippet as follows:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

The fix is to replace the `is_integer` function with `isinstance` and check if `i` is an instance of the `int` class.

This fix will ensure that the index values are of the same type as the index and will pass the test cases without affecting other successful test cases.
