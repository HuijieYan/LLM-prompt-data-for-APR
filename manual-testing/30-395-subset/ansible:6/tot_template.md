Identify and act as three different experts who are suitable for answering this question.
Each expert will document the steps and their thought process, then share it with the group.
Subsequently, all experts will proceed to the next step, and so on.
During each step, all experts will rate their peers' responses on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 indicating high unlikelihood, and 5 indicating high likelihood with a brief logical explanation.
In each round, simulate a **prestigious professor** in the relevant field who consistently disagrees with the proposed solution and highlights weaknesses in the proposed solutions from other experts.

If any expert is judged to be incorrect at any point, they will exit the process.
After all experts have provided their analyses, you will then evaluate all 3 analyses and offer either the consensus solution or your best guess solution.

Now the question to discuss is:
