The bug in the code is that the `build` method assumes that the `cell.state_size` attribute is always an integer or a list of integers. However, it can be an instance of the `tuple` class as well, causing the `hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__')` check to fail.

To fix this issue, we can use the built-in `isinstance` function to check if `cell.state_size` is an instance of the `tuple` class. If it is, we can get the first element of the tuple to compute the `output_dim`. Otherwise, we can use `cell.state_size` directly.

Here's the fixed code snippet:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if isinstance(cell.state_size, tuple):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

Now, the fixed code snippet takes into account the possibility of `cell.state_size` being an instance of the `tuple` class and assigns the correct value to `output_dim` accordingly.
